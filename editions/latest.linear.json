Sailing hero Ben Ainslie carried the Union Jack followed by athletes from every nation, flowing in single file through the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe delighted athletes jogged, danced, jumped up on the speakers as rockers Elbow belted out the anthem One Day Like This.\n</p>\n<p>\nTeam Ghana did the conga. A French team member even performed a back flip.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThen the 10,490 sporting stars moved into eight “mosh pits” around a stage featuring a vast Union Jack graphic designed by artist Damien Hirst.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFootage of London 2012’s incredible highs and tear-jerking lows flashed up on a pyramid of 303 white boxes — one for each event.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe impressive scenes gave way for the final victory ceremony of the games as the men’s marathon winners took the podium.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUganda’s Stephen Kiprotich was presented with his gold, Kenyans Abel Kirui and Wilson Kipsang got silver and bronze.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the massive crowd cheered the 70,000 Games Maker volunteer workers were showered with petals — while drummers and a choir performed the Beatles classic Here Comes The Sun.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe excited athletes had been at fever pitch as they waited outside to make their grand entrance.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMany tweeted to say they could hear the music but could see nothing — and were desperate to get in.\n</p>\n<p>\nSwimming star Rebecca Adlington posted: “Stood outside the stadium waiting to be let in... COME ONNNNNN!”\n</p>\n<p>\nTeam-mate Kate Haywood added: “Stood outside stadium — missing it all!” And hockey star Sally Walton added: “Share the party... let us in! Having a dance outside.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The epic closing ceremony began with a journey through a normal working day in the life of London from dawn until sunset — featuring iconic landmarks Big Ben, The Gherkin and Tower Bridge.\n</i></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCars covered in newspaper cuttings drove around the stadium — each clipping featuring quotes from English literature classics.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom the top of Big Ben the figure of Winston Churchill emerged — played by actor Timothy Spall.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe quoted the famous lines from Shakespeare’s The Tempest that featured in the opening ceremony: “Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises’.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen Churchill yelled: “Stop!” — and silence fell. He dramatically gestured to the Royal box — to announce the arrival of Prince Harry, representing the Queen — and Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAlso in the Royal box were the Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne, Olympics boss Lord Coe and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Next we had a dash of British humour as Del Boy and Rodney’s Reliant van exploded on stage.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nSir Michael Caine appeared on a giant screen in a scene from the movie The Italian Job — and his distinctive voice echoed around the stadium to start the countdown.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe vast crowd joined in, yelling: “Five, four, three, two, one.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAt which point Del’s motor burst into flame and Batman and Robin appeared out of the wreckage — a jokey reference to one of the most famous episodes from classic sitcom Only Fools And Horses.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen the party really got under way with a flamboyant section of the show that celebrated the best of British music.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>But even the best parties have to end. And finally, London Mayor Boris Johnson drew down the curtain on Britain’s greatest-ever sporting adventure.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe handed the Olympic flag to Mr Rogge, who passed it to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of 2016 host city Rio de Janeiro.\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon 2012 maestro Lord Coe said: “On the first day of these games I said we were determined to do it right. I said that these Games would see the best of us.\n</p>\n<p>\n“On this last day I can conclude with these words: When our time came — Britain we did it right. Thank you.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter 16 days blazing in the arena, the flame was extinguished. But for everyone who shared the glory of London 2012, the memory will continue to burn bright.\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\ne.nash@the-sun.co.uk\n</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nMusic legends raise the roof as perfect mix wows\n</h4>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>By OLIVER HARVEY, Chief Feature Writer</b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSO we all came together for one last hurrah.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe last, crazy disco at the end of the greatest party of our lives.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThey were all there, dancing along with giddy delight beneath the still flaming Olympic cauldron — the greatest athletes of our age from 204 nations.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nDancing at our party — celebrating The Greatest Games — as millions joined in across the land.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nNone needed much coaxing to join the rapturous singalong to Monty Python’s Always Look On The Bright Side of Life. Britain has managed to capture the bright side of life and package it to the world for the past 17 days.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nWith it, we’ve found a surge of collective confidence.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nEverything worked, everything went to plan — on and off the track. And this from a country, doubters told us, that was unable to fashion booze-ups in breweries.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nLike the Games themselves, last night’s Symphony of British Music was a mix, the best of the old and the new. Elgar and the Coldstream Guards through The Who and Muse to Tinie Tempah and One Direction. Witty in places, cheesy in others. But brilliant.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nLast night we showed another discipline we are world-beaters at — a damn good knees-up. And credit had to go to organisers Kim Gavin and Stephen Daldry.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAll were transfixed as 10,000 lights transformed the set of the newsprint city into a luminous funfair. The spectacle was staged using 108 vehicles, including 50 scooters and ten black cabs.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAs Team GB marched in, four-time gold medallist Ben Ainslie held aloft the Union Flag — a flag for too long hijacked by hate-mongers.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThis glorious stadium was again a sea of red, white and blue, as it has been at every venue for every event.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe very British sound of Madness’s Our House and Blur’s Park Life — performed by the Household Division Ceremonial State Band — became singalongs.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe appearance of Del Boy and Rodney in fancy dress as Batman and Robin in the Trotters’ Reliant van was a masterstroke. It will have baffled many in the global audience, but is a cherished part of our popular culture.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nJust as it had come to the Games, Girl Power came to the party last night. A sort of, “You’ll never guess who I had on top of my cab last night...” as the Spice Girls re-formed.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThey belted out classics Spice Up Your Life and Wannabe, which inspired a whole generation. And this Olympics has certainly been a triumph for women. Saudi Arabia’s first female Olympian Wojdan Shahrkhani stepped nervously on to the judo mat after hardliners had warned she had “thrown away her place in the afterlife”. Her bravery transcends sport.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nFor those concerned that our rainbow nation was splitting at the seams following last summer’s riots, the spirit of the Games and last night’s show have been silencers.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nMuse thrilled with their theatrical performance of the official Olympic song, Survival, while Elbow belted out anthems Open Arms and One Day Like This.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nOne Direction were cheered through What Makes You Beautiful and the Pet Shop Boys — as ever — could be relied on for a spectacular display as they performed West End Girls from bizarre rickshaws.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nMadcap comic Russell Brand gave the crowd renditions of Pure Imagination and The Beatles’ I Am The Walrus. Fatboy Slim cranked out hits Right Here Right Now and The Rockafeller Skank, Jessie J sang Price Tag and Emeli Sande reminded us why she has exploded on to the scene with a moving cover of Professor Green’s Read All About It.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nCarrying the torch for British rock, Brian May and Roger Taylor performed Queen classic Brighton Rock — while Kaiser Chiefs covered The Who’s Pinball Wizard.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nTinie Tempah’s Written In The Stars and Taio Cruz’s Dynamite brought things bang up to date.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nA high point, though, was The Kinks’ Ray Davies singing Waterloo Sunset, with its lyrics: “As long as I gaze on Waterloo Sunset, I am in paradise.”\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nLondon has been a stunning backdrop, but these have been a British Games. Among the army of Games Makers in the stadium — the volunteers who worked to make it all work — was Terence Brady, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBorn in St Kitts, the Caribbean, the 56-year-old said: “I wanted to give something back to this country.

Samantha Murray later added another silver in the modern pentathlon. </p>\n<p>\nAnd last night Britain finished <b>THIRD</b> in the global medals table behind US and China, with our biggest takings since 1908. </p>\n<p>\n<i>British Olympic Association boss Andy Hunt hailed it the “greatest performance of our greatest team at the greatest Olympics ever”.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: “Combine that with the support of the British public and it’s been magical. It’s lifted the whole country, brought people together and it’s been a fantastic performance. I’m very proud of what we’ve done.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday the Queen congratulated British and Commonwealth athletes, saying they had “captured the public’s imagination and earned their admiration”. </p>\n<p>\nShe added: “The outstanding performance of Team GB in achieving the greatest Olympic success since 1908, will, I am sure, have inspired a new generation of Olympians and reminded us all how sport unifies communities and nations. I congratulate, too, the organisers of the Games, as well as the thousands of volunteers who have epitomised the Olympic spirit through the warm welcome they have shown to the sporting teams and spectators from all around the world.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Queen and Prince Philip will hold a reception for Team GB at Buckingham Palace in October. </p>\n<p>\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson said yesterday’s final three medal wins brought “a fairy-tale end to the greatest Olympics ever staged”. </p>\n<p>\nHe added: “The Herculean efforts of our sports men and woman have truly scaled the heights, delivering a third place ranking for Team GB which we hardly dared to believe possible. </p>\n<p>\n“Athletes from every competing nation deserve our collective praise in testimony to their staggering dedication and hard work, which has delivered a truly thrilling spectacle for billions of spectators around the globe.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPerhaps the most memorable day of the Games was the gold rush of Super Saturday — when Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford all grabbed gold medals within 45 minutes of each other. </p>\n<p>\n<i>They are now among those tipped to rake in thousands from book deals as experts predict huge demand for Olympic autobiographies.</i> </p>\n<p>\nHarperSport boss Rory Scarfe told The Bookseller trade magazine: “Mo Farah is very interesting — he’s got an amazing story.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut it’s not just the star gold medal winners who are set to cash in. Up-and-coming star Adam Gemili — at the centre of the 4x100m relay blunder that cost his team a place in the final — is also in line for a big advance for his story. </p>\n<p>\nPublisher Yellow Jersey has already signed up for a new autobiography of cycle hero Bradley Wiggins. Rower Greg Searle’s memoir If Not Now, When? is published by Pan Macmillan this month. </p>\n<p>\nVictoria Pendleton’s autobiography Between the Lines is published next month by HarperSport. </p>\n<p>\nSainsbury’s head of books Phil Carroll said Olympic merchandise, including books, has been “selling well against forecast”. </p>\n<p>\nOlympics memorabilia is also doing a roaring trade online. Items up for sale on the official London 2012 auction site included a pair of Tom Daley’s Speedos, signed by the bronze medal-winning diver. </p>\n<p>\nReplica cycling jerseys signed by Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy were also up for grabs. </p>\n<p>\nBids for the basketball used in the men’s final topped £3,000 yesterday. </p>\n<p>\nThe official results sheet from the men’s 4 x 100m relay final was on offer for bids of £4,500 or more. </p>\n<p>\nFans of Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony could snap up one of the maypoles used in the Green and Pleasant Land segment, with bids topping £200 last night. </p>\n<p>\nAlso available were costumes used in the ceremony, including the nurses’ outfits. All profits from the official auction site will be distributed to sporting bodies. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, on eBay sellers were offering “bottled Olympic air” and a tissue used to wipe a seat at the stadium. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nj.mills@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nBoxer Joshua hits 29th gold </h4>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBOXER Anthony Joshua capped a magnificent Games for Team GB’s fighters by taking the super-heavyweight gold yesterday. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBig Josh — all 6ft 6in of him — beat defending champion Roberto Cammarelle of Italy on countback after a nailbiting draw. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAnthony, 22, of Finchley, North London, was three points behind going into the final round when he let fly with a flurry of punches. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nWith the final score 18-18, the 10,000 crowd at the ExCel arena erupted as the referee awarded it to the Brit. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBut there was an agonising ten-minute wait after the Italians lodged a protest, which was rejected.

I hope your memories of London’s Games last as long and burn as bright.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBarack Obama last night led the world’s congratulations. </p>\n<p>\nThe US President rang Mr Cameron to heap praise on the “brilliant” Games as well as Team GB’s outstanding performance. </p>\n<p>\nHe also thanked Britain for the warm welcome the US team had received, along with his wife Michelle who went to the opening ceremony. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\na.west@the-sun.co.uk\n</a></p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nSun's gong for unsung heroes\n</h4>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\n'A medal for every volunteer'\n</h4>\n<p align=\"left\">\nTHE amazing army of Olympic helpers must be rewarded with a special medal, a Tory MP has urged.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nMore than 100,000 volunteers, troops, cops and paramedics toiled behind the scenes.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSoldiers, sailors, airmen, police and other emergency staff will get commemorative coins.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe 88,000 volunteers will only receive a silver spray-painted commemorative baton.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBut Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said: “The Games couldn’t have happened without them.

She said: “We’re kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it.” Cleese wrote sitcom Fawlty Towers with Connie, featuring the famous line: “Don’t mention the war.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSplits from actress Barbara and psychotherapist Alyce Faye cost him more than £14million. Cleese performed a series of shows dubbed the Alimony Tour to help pay divorce bills. </p>\n<p>\nCleese’s Monty Python pal Terry Gilliam said last year: “If he marries again, he is stupid.

Mo Farah","image":"images/Mo_Farah_with_both_1565103a.jpg","section":"news","headline":"Mo Farah: Look at all the pictures of me!","teaser":"THE double Olympic champion picks up copy of The Sun which features him on the front page, the back page and the inside pages after his historic feat","byline":"By VIKKI ORVICE","timestamp":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nMO Farah picked up my copy of The Sun and looked at the front page. Then the back page. Then the inside pages. </p>\n<p>\nThe double Olympic champion said: “I can’t believe this coverage. Look at all the pictures of me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I pointed out his performance on Saturday night had dominated every single news outlet — papers, internet, radio and TV — it was clear the enormity of what he had achieved was yet to sink in. </p>\n<p>\nSeven days after he became the first British man to win an Olympic distance title in the 10,000metres he pulled off one of the greatest achievements in UK athletics — adding the 5,000metre gold. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMo said: “You have a dream of becoming Olympic champion in your career but to do it twice in your home city ... there are no words to describe that. </p>\n<p>\n“Double Olympic champion. Who would have thought that? </p>\n<p>\n“All the sacrifices have been worth it now but it’s been a lot of hard work and graft.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Mo’s reaction as he took the 5,000metres gold — wide-eyed, arms outstretched and yelling with unrestrained delight — is one of the iconic photos of London 2012.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said of that magical moment: “My first thought was, ‘I can’t believe I’ve done it again.’\n</p>\n<p>\n“It was the best feeling by far a week earlier and I had done it again. I just thought, ‘Wow!’\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I remember driving to a British athletics league match in the car with friends on 6 July 2005 when London won the bid for the 2012 Games. We stopped at a petrol station and heard it on the radio. </p>\n<p>\n“Back then I dreamed of taking part, not winning twice. But before I came out into the stadium for Saturday’s race I was very calm. </p>\n<p>\n“It was like it was my moment, it was meant to be. It shows you can get there if you keep working and stick at it even when there are lows as well as highs.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMo’s wife Tania, who is expecting twins next month, and seven-year-old daughter Rhianna were in the Olympic Stadium to share Saturday’s triumph. He said: “After the victory ceremony I kept the medal in my pocket to show Tania. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Rhianna was running round and round with it. I think she was more impressed at seeing Usain Bolt in the stadium, though! </p>\n<p>\n“We have the same agent and Bolt gave her a hug and she took a picture of him. She was like, ‘Bolt, Bolt, Bolt’. </p>\n<p>\n“I rang my mum. She had been so nervous she couldn’t watch the race on TV but she was so happy. </p>\n<p>\n“I didn’t get back to the Athlete's Village until 3am. I got some food and then tried to go to bed but I couldn’t sleep.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMo, who also won gold at 5,000metres and silver at 10,000metres in the world athletics championships and took double gold at the European championships, is dedicating his Olympic gongs to his unborn twins. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “When I saw the two medals this morning I thought, ‘That’s for the twins.’\n</p>\n<p>\n“I didn’t want to have one twin have one medal and the other left out. That’s what drove me on.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<i>But by dedicating the golds to the babies, Mo is aware he may have to get Rhianna an Olympic medal of her own at Rio 2016</i>. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “Rhianna has got the World and European medals. Though I may have to get another Olympic gold for her now.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMo’s triumph makes him a member of an exclusive athletic club. In the past 40 years only three men have achieved the distance double at the same Olympics. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey are Lasse Viren in 1972 and 1976, Miruts Yifter in 1980 and Kenenisa Bekele, who Farah beat on Super Saturday, in Beijing four years ago. </p>\n<p>\nLast year Mo aimed for the double at the World Championships and narrowly missed. </p>\n<p>\nThis time, with 80,000 people roaring him on in the Olympic Stadium and millions watching on TV, there was no stopping him. It was the reward for a journey which saw Mo travel from war-torn Somalia with his mother as an eight-year-old. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe arrived in Hounslow, West London, knowing only three English phrases. They were “Excuse me”, “Where is the toilet?” and not so helpfully, “C’mon then” — which was to get him into trouble with a playground bully. </p>\n<p>\nIt was also a reward for the personal sacrifices he, Tania and Rhianna have had to make. They include the difficult decision to uproot his family 18 months ago and move to Portland, Oregon, to work with coach Alberto Salazar. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “When I moved to America people said, ‘Mo, you are a double European champion, why are you doing this?’ But I knew something had to change if that next step up was going to happen. </p>\n<p>\n“I was coming sixth, seventh and if I hadn’t made that change I don’t think I would be here with these medals today.” </p>\n<p>\nDespite being together in the US, 29-year-old Mo has had numerous enforced separations from his family because of training in Kenya, Albuquerque and the Pyrenees. </p>\n<p>\nThen this year alone there have been competitions in Glasgow, Boston, Istanbul and Helsinki. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMo said: “It hasn’t been easy at home and Tania and I haven’t seen a lot of each other. I was even in Kenya when Tania told me she was pregnant. </p>\n<p>\n“It felt like it was a gamble, moving my daughter out of school, taking my wife and not knowing too much about Portland. All I knew was that it was good for training. But half the year I am away so you have that responsibility to make sure they are happy. </p>\n<p>\n“So I’m glad Tania and Rhianna like it. The other real sacrifice has been not having any friends. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s a pretty lonely event. I’ve got my training partner Galen Rupp, who got Olympic 10,000metre silver here, and running friends. But you tend to drift away from anyone else who is not into running.”\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing Mo has found tough is leaving behind his beloved Arsenal. Pride of place on a wall of the dining room in his Portland home is a signed Arsenal shirt. </p>\n<p>\nNext to it is a frame containing his European and World championship medals. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I visited him in March he joked that there was a spare bit of wall for an Olympic gold medal. Now he has two. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “There is a space, so yes I’ll now have to get a frame and hang the medals there.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nv.orvice@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nGirl twinners </h4>\n<p align=\"left\">\nMO’S success may prove to run in the family — after a scan showed his unborn twins have long legs ideal for pounding the track. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe double Olympic champ has pledged to give the girls — due next month — one of his golds each. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBut asked if he wanted them to emulate his success, he said: “I hope so.

James’s publishing sensation.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Here, bestselling novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford tells us why she finds the book a real turn-off.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEN I first read Fifty Shades Of Grey, I realised the book had no plot — and was shallow, juvenile and mediocre.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was badly written and could not hold a candle to erotic classics such as Lady Chatterley’s Lover by D.H. Lawrence, and Henry Miller’s Tropic Of Cancer.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo my mind, Fifty Shades is a modern fairytale, a young woman’s fantasy — and Christian Grey a somewhat “contrived” dreamboat of a man.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I decided perhaps Christian was the real reason for the book’s huge success. Someone women could fantasise about.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The perfect lover — one that doesn’t exist in real life.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThinking about it again, I have changed my mind.\n</p>\n<p>\nNot about the merits of the book, which still stand — but about Christian Grey.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs far as I’m concerned, he is every woman’s nightmare — cold, detached, controlling, manipulative and genuinely selfish. It’s all about Christian and what he wants from Anastasia Steele for his own sexual pleasure. It’s not about Ana and her desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe is being used by him, not loved. And that’s a bit of a turn-off.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnastasia is attracted to Christian because of his looks. He’s tall, dark and handsome. And a billionaire.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd so she goes along with his weird ideas about sex, and some of his sex toys. Although there were not too many ideas in these pages, which became dull.\n</p>\n<p>\nInevitably, the “sameness” of the sex scenes became even more boring to me, and to most of the women who visited my Facebook page in the past week.\n</p>\n<p>\nI’ve had almost 18,000 hits since posting a review of the book, and most visitors agree the sex scenes are disappointing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey have also pointed out there is not much S&M or “dark stuff” in Fifty Shades as has been suggested all along. That’s the reason there’s been so much fuss. Some people have suggested the book should be banned. What nonsense.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere’s nothing that bad in it that it should be removed from shelves.\n</p>\n<p>\nGoing back to Christian Grey, he is so controlling he becomes a pain. He tells Ana what to wear, what to do, how to run her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for Anastasia, she seems weak-willed and old-fashioned. It’s unrealistic to think a young woman who is emancipated and has a job would put up with his dictatorial ways.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>She would no doubt move on in today’s world.</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"images/SNF11LADY4---620_1565631a.jpg","caption":"Her opinion isn't grey ...

I asked if I could give him a kiss and that was the last I saw of him. </p>\n<p>\n“My children have always known they had a brother and Samantha decided to track him down. It took three months but eventually she found him. </p>\n<p>\n“I was worried that we might face rejection but, fortunately, he wanted to get to know us too. </p>\n<p>\n“I spoke to him a lot on the telephone but I could never have afforded the flights to get there. </p>\n<p>\n“But going on Millionaire made it possible for me to go down to Australia to see him for the first time since he was a six-week-old tot.” Dawn, a grandmother-of-six, flew to Australia with Samantha and son Brian, 40, and sobbed when she met Glyn and his family. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “It’s incredible to meet them, it’s like having a whole new family who I never knew about. </p>\n<p>\n“I love it out here in Australia and I’m looking forward to making plenty more trips over. </p>\n<p>\n“The money I won has made all the difference to us. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s had a very happy life and for that I’m very grateful.

Instead he leaves Jeanette to express his feelings. </p>\n<p>\nJeanette, 68, speaking from their home in Grants Pass, Oregon, with Kit by her side, said: “Oh, gosh. Kit has seen the photo. But he can’t talk about it. </p>\n<p>\n“He just can’t, because it hurts him too much. Of course he’s worried, he’s incredibly concerned. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I saw the photos I thought, ‘Oh no, this is not good. Either he’s dying of some disease or he’s heavily into drugs.’”\n</p>\n<p>\nJeanette and Kit — who have been together for 17 years but have known each other for decades — had a growing suspicion about Macaulay’s alleged heroin abuse. </p>\n<p>\nIf the accusations are true, it would not be the first time the former child star has been involved with drugs. </p>\n<p>\nIn 2004, Macaulay was arrested for possession of marijuana and two controlled substances — Alprazolam and Clonazepam. He was given three one-year suspended jail terms. </p>\n<p>\nLast night Jeanette said: “Now we’re hearing he is denying the allegations — but it certainly looks like he is on drugs. He looks awful.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was Kit who first put Macaulay on the road to fame. </p>\n<p>\n<i>The former actor started his son out on his career when he was only four and Macaulay was landing movie roles at eight. Kit quit his job to manage his son’s career.</i> </p>\n<p>\nMacaulay, now 31, became a household name because of his portrayal of Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. </p>\n<p>\nHe went on to have roles in Richie Rich, Uncle Buck, My Girl, The Pagemaster and Party Monster — as well as his friend Michael Jackson’s music video Black Or White. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the height of his fame he was regarded as the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple. </p>\n<p>\nMacaulay was a millionaire by ten, thanks to the first Home Alone film. </p>\n<p>\nHe was paid £70,000 for that and £3million for the sequel, but he decided to quit acting aged 14. </p>\n<p>\nThe following year Kit left, Patricia filed for custody of Macaulay and his six siblings and a bitter public battle took place. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Eventually, the star had his parents legally blocked from controlling his £11million fortune — a move that estranged him for good from Kit.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe later said: “I’d made enough money by the time I was 12 to never have to work again.” </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, despite their troubled history, Kit would love to be reunited with his son. Jeanette said: “There will always be a sadness in Kit that I can’t fix. Our house is always open to Kit’s children. Kit still loves him and all of his family. </p>\n<p>\n“I think if he ever got a letter from Mack or any of his kids, saying, ‘Gee Dad, I’d really like to see you’ or something, then he’d probably get back to them.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMacaulay loves to write and in 2006 he penned a book called Junior, about a former child star who may be insane. </p>\n<p>\nAt first he claimed it was about him — then said it was not. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I disassociated myself from ‘Macaulay Culkin’ mentally. When I was 14 and I quit, I said, ‘I’m never doing that again.’ Say whatever you want about me, that I’m crazy, that I’m an alcoholic. Call me a drug addict. I don’t give a s*** any more.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe is now a virtual recluse. Home for Macaulay is a £2million apartment in Manhattan. The actor has denied allegations it has been turned into his own “private drug den”. </p>\n<p>\nThe star has described his existence as a “simple, simple life” — walking the dog, feeding his fish, cleaning his home and cooking meals between his infrequent acting jobs — confessing that he is “not exactly the hardest-working actor”. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I could have just put up a big fortress around myself, bought a big chunk of land somewhere and just escaped. </p>\n<p>\n“But I made a decision when I was 14 that I was going to live life.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Kit simply wants to remember the blonde-haired little boy with a cheeky attitude.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe watches the child star’s movies over and over again. </p>\n<p>\nJeanette said: “The only place he sees Mack is on TV. But he watches the movies and he’s very quiet. </p>\n<p>\n“I try not to bother him. But the funny thing is, I know he’s still very proud of Mack and his kids. We just hope there is a happy ending to all this.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMacaulay has been through great sadness himself in recent times. His girlfriend of eight years, Black Swan actress Mila Kunis, dumped him in 2010 and recently started dating Hollywood hunk Ashton Kutcher. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But Kit and Jeanette believe it is the death of Macaulay’s sister Dakota in a car crash in 2008 which has ripped the family apart.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nJeanette added: “When Dakota died, I went into the room and I said, ‘Kit, I have something really, really bad to tell you. And he said, ‘I don’t want to know.’ That’s just his way of coping. I’ve never seen him cry. He just goes inside.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHermit Kit refuses to leave his home because he is still distraught about the breakdown of his family. </p>\n<p>\nJeanette revealed that it has changed his personality. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “Kit is pretty sensitive. I was there during the custody battle. That tore his soul out. </p>\n<p>\n“Kit is a lot different than the happy-go-lucky Kit that I knew in the Seventies. There’s a deep, deep hole that’s never going to be filled.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJeanette added: “We don’t live off a penny from Mack. We live off benefits. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“But we live simple. We’re happy.”</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nThe facts on Macaulay Culkin </h4>\n<p>\nFIRST major film role was in Uncle Buck. Aged just nine, he starred alongside John Candy, who he would later be reacquainted with in Home Alone. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPreviously he had roles in little-known American movies 1988’s Rocket Gibraltar and See You In The Morning in 1989. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis most famous film, 1990’s Home Alone, took £300million at the box office worldwide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMacaulay has had 14 major film roles – the most recent was Sex And Breakfast in 2007. Macaulay has also appeared in US telly shows Will & Grace, Frasier and Robot Chicken. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn 1998, he married actress Rachel Miner, but the pair separated two years later and divorced in 2002. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn May 2002, Macaulay began dating Black Swan actress Mila Kunis, but the pair were to split in late 2010. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCulkin was arrested in September 2004 for the possession of marijuana, Alprazolam and Clonazepam. He eventually received three one-year suspended prison sentences. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis younger brother, Kieran, is also an actor who also appeared in Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis most prominent movie roles came in 2002’s Igby Goes Down and the cult hit Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World in 2010. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRory, the youngest of the Culkins, has also appeared alongside his brothers in various films. He teamed up with Macaulay in The Good Son and Richie Rich, while working with Kieran in Igby Goes Down. Last year he appeared in horror movie Scream 4. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPICTURES: COLEMAN-RAYNES </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4468520/Macauley-Culkin-drug-claims-rubbished-by-representatives.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Culkin camp slams $6,000 drug habit claims as 'fictitious and insulting'"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4126603/Macaulay-Culkin-is-out-and-about.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Scrawny Macaulay is out and about"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4121469/Macaulay-Culkin-Im-fit-and-well.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Macaulay Culkin: I'm fit and well"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4119075/Macaulay-Culkin-looks-worryingly-skinny-out-in-New-York.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Actor needs a Big Mac-aulay Culkin"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4409647/Mila-Kunis-is-one-Elle-of-a-beauty.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Mila Kunis is one Elle of a beauty"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/mc-620_1565027a.jpg","caption":"Bodes ill ...

But they may also have the advantage of knowing a few insider last-minute diet and exercise tips when it comes to preparing for big events. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Well, why should you miss out? Sun fitness and nutrition experts Nicki Waterman and Amanda Ursell have a few tricks up their sleeves to help when you are getting ready for “date night”. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i><b>Today they reveal their guide to getting it right on the night with their pre-date preparation plan.</b></i>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nDiet </h4>\n<p>\nHere are Amanda’s Top Ten diet dos and don’ts to have you feeling your best, and her menu to prepare for a night out. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Don’t try to starve yourself: </b>Fasting will leave you feeling light-headed, stressed and definitely not at your sparkling best by the time the evening comes. </p>\n<p>\nNot only will you feel more like going to bed than going out but once you do hit the nightlife any alcohol you have will go straight to your head — which is not a great start to a date. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Have two eggs for breakfast: </b>Eggs take up very little space in your stomach so they don’t cause bloating and they are extraordinarily filling. </p>\n<p>\nA two-egg breakfast will keep you going until lunchtime without your stomach rumbling. </p>\n<p>\nIt seems to be a particular type of protein in eggs that has this satisfying effect on our bodies. </p>\n<p>\nIf you don’t like eggs, have a 40g bowl of Special K. It is slowly digested and not too bulky. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Stick with your normal coffee and tea intake over the day: </b>The last thing you want is a cracking headache triggered by caffeine withdrawal on your big date. </p>\n<p>\nHowever, swap cappuccinos and lattes for instant coffee or Americanos and a splash of milk — this helps to keep the calories down and, if you do have an intolerance to large amounts of milk, reduces the risk of bloating. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Avoid onions and pulses: </b>These foods are classic for causing trapped wind, the last thing you need when trying to get into a favourite outfit. Swede is another wind-causing food. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis means that things like minestrone soup and baked beans are all off the menu for the day. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Stick with still drinks: </b>You need to keep hydrated during the day to avoid added stress. Do so by sipping water and not having fizzy drinks, including sparkling water. </p>\n<p>\nThe bubbles in these drinks can extend your stomach and literally expand your waistband. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Have chamomile tea:</b> This is famed for its calming properties. If you are feeling anxious about your date, you may swallow more air than usual over the course of the day, taking short sharp breaths rather than long slow ones. </p>\n<p>\nSwallowing air has a similar effect to drinking fizzy drinks. Try having two to three mugs during the day to help soothe nerves. </p>\n<p>\nEat two squares of dark chocolate as your snack: Dark chocolate seems, from a piece of recent research, to be quite filling. Like eggs, it does not take up much space in your stomach or cause it to become distended after eating. </p>\n<p>\nOther good choices include a handful of almonds or other salt-free nuts or a small banana. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Have a pre-date real Greek yogurt:</b> It’s slightly higher in protein than other yogurts as well as being higher in fat. This means it is another good food for keeping hunger at bay while being nourishing and not causing bloating. </p>\n<p>\nTry a peppermint tea: It’s traditionally been used to help calm the digestive system. Our small intestines and colon are especially prone to reacting to stress and can trigger bloating as a part of irritable bowel syndrome. Peppermint tea may help to steady things when getting ready for your date. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Slow down when you eat: </b>Like being stressed and chewing gum, eating quickly causes you to swallow more air than usual, which can lead to your stomach and abdomen becoming bloated. </p>\n<p>\nTry to chew for longer and to eat in a calm way rather than gulping food down on the go. </p>\n<p>\nTHIS menu assumes you will be eating a meal when you go out. </p>\n<p>\nIf you aren’t, swap the Greek yogurt for a plain chicken sandwich on white bread or a peanut butter sandwich on white bread. These will not cause you to bloat. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Breakfast: </b>Two scrambled eggs made with a splash of milk, plus a slice of white toast. Tea or coffee or a glass of hot water with lemon. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid am: </b>Mug of chamomile tea. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lunch: </b>A medium-sized avocado with two crispbreads. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid pm:</b> Two squares of dark chocolate or a handful of nuts with a mug of peppermint tea. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Pre-date snack:</b> Two tablespoons of Greek yogurt, a handful of nuts. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nWorkout </h4>\n<p>\nYOU don’t need any special equipment, just as long as you have a pillow and two half-litre bottles of water. </p>\n<p>\nThis workout is best done after a hot bath, when your muscles are warm and relaxed. </p>\n<p>\nAim to do two to three sets of 12 to 15 repetitions of each of the moves, right, then follow with some gentle stretches. </p>\n<p>\nPlease check with your doctor before starting any exercise programme. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1. TARGETS YOUR CHEST, SHOULDERS AND TRICEPS:</b> These bent-knee press-ups will give you the toned, sculpted upper body you need to look great in sleeveless dresses. </p>\n<p>\nAssume a press-up position with your hands slightly more than shoulder width apart, knees bent and legs crossed at the ankles. You can rest your knees on a rolled-up towel if you like. Bend your elbows until your chest comes close to the floor, keeping back straight. Hold for one count as you straighten arms and press up to starting position. Repeat. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2. TARGETS YOUR TUMMY AND WAIST: </b>By tightening the abdominal and waist area, this exercise will ensure you maintain good posture. It will also remind you how to hold that tummy in! </p>\n<p>\nLie on the floor with arms extended at sides. Bend knees 90° but keep feet a few inches off the floor. </p>\n<p>\nPlace a folded pillow between knees and slowly rotate at the waist, dropping your legs to the left. </p>\n<p>\nTouch left knee to floor, hold briefly, then bring legs back to centre and repeat on the other side. Keep abs tight, palms down and shoulder blades and mid-back glued to the floor at all times. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3. TARGETS POSTURE (to make you look taller and thinner): </b>Not so much an exercise as something to remember. Keep spine in alignment, ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, and knees over toes. Rest your weight on the balls of your feet for more graceful movement. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4. TARGETS YOUR BOTTOM AND THIGHS: </b>These squat lifts will tighten, lift and shape your bottom, thighs and legs. </p>\n<p>\nStand with feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward. Hold weights – or those bottles of water – with both hands on lower back. </p>\n<p>\nLower into squat, hips back, weight in heels, leaning forward with back flat, knees at 90°. Squeeze butt to stand. As legs straighten, extend right leg to side. Lower and repeat, then switch sides. </p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\nStretches to finish </h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5. SHOULDERS AND CHEST: </b>Clasp your hands behind your back. Lift your arms up slowly until you feel the stretch. </p>\n<p>\n<b>6. TRICEPS AND SHOULDERS:</b> Gently pull your elbow behind your head. Then do the same with the other. </p>\n<p>\n<b>7. QUADRICEPS: </b>Hold leg with opposite arm. Don’t lock knee of straight leg. Can also do it lying on stomach. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>8. LOWER BACK: </b>Lie on back, making sure that your lower back is flat on the ground. Pull your knees to your chest. </p>\n<p>\n<b>9. HAMSTRINGS: </b>Sit on floor.<b> </b>Put one foot against opposite thigh of extended leg. Bend forward from the hip. Don’t bend neck. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4472945/Do-diet-supplements-work-We-look-at-Adios-Zorim-and-Full-Fast-to-find-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Will power VERSUS pill power"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4461933/Eat-your-way-to-younger-looks.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Eat your way to younger looks"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4454610/Apps-that-can-give-you-abs-and-help-you-lose-weight-give-up-booze-and-sleep-better.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Apps that can give you abs"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4444650/6-of-the-best-outdoor-fitness-classes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"6 of the best... outdoor fitness classes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4444240/Look-4lb-lighter-in-four-days.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Look 4lb lighter in four days"}}],"image":[{"uri":"images/fit-620_1564980a.jpg","caption":"Look your best ... with these top tips from our experts"},{"uri":"images/stretch-620_1564989a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/back-620_1564988a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/bottom-620_1564987a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/tum-620_1564986a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/chest-620_1564985a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/chocav-620_1565192a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Loving ...

But she made sure I had the choices she didn’t have. I wanted to go travelling and wanted to do this and that. </p>\n<p>\nSo I have avoided getting pregnant, and marriage. I am not against either. But my mom did not marry my biological dad, who I’ve never even met. She married Greg <i>(Dawson)</i> when I was a baby and I regarded him as my real dad. They had my brother, Clay, who is four years younger. </p>\n<p>\nI was brought up in a rat-infested squat on the Lower East Side in New York. </p>\n<p>\nI have asked since: “What in the world made them move two children into an abandoned building with no heat, no water and no electricity?”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe reason was that they could build their home around us, which was not something you could easily do in New York. </p>\n<p>\nMy mom learned how to do plumbing and they put in sewage lines. My dad learned how to do electrics and we had light. They also learned construction and replaced the slanted floors with a proper floor and put in windows. Suddenly, we had a home. </p>\n<p>\nWe were very loving and close and it was a fun way of growing up. It also gave me an awareness of life and death. </p>\n<p>\nI knew about the risk of Aids, for example, from the age of about six. I am of the generation that grew up with Aids — just as the next generation had iPods and all they know is high-speed internet. </p>\n<p>\n<i>My mom was of the previous generation where if you had unprotected sex you could get pregnant. For me, unprotected sex could kill you.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nI was in High School watching all these kids having unprotected sex and getting pregnant, with their reaction: “It’s totally fine — whatever.” My first film, Kids, when I was 15, was all about that very subject. I was hired for my looks <i>(she is of Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban descent)</i> by director Larry Clark, who saw me outside our apartment. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a strong theme about the risk of Aids in the film of the stage show Rent, when I played a character who was 18, HIV positive and addicted to heroin. </p>\n<p>\nI am lucky, thanks to many warnings from my mom, that I avoided the dangers and just played it out in films! </p>\n<p>\nI have not been shy of playing stronger women roles. Women are sexual and the characters that I have played are sexual. </p>\n<p>\nI am not ashamed to do that. In Sin City, I played Gail who wears just tiny strips of leather, carries handcuffs and wears a mohawk hairstyle. I even had my hair cut for that. </p>\n<p>\nMy mom had shaved her hair into a mohawk at one point and shaved her head completely when she was 40 so I didn’t have hang-ups. </p>\n<p>\nAs for the film Alexander, which was trashed by the critics, I had this bedroom scene with Colin Farrell that people seem to remember. Sienna Miller told me that in London she read a review that said the only two good things in the film were my left breast and right breast. </p>\n<p>\nI never had a burning desire to become an actress and timing has been very important. </p>\n<p>\nHollywood does not change and it never will for any reason other than money. No one is handing anything to Latinas, it’s just the population is changing in America and they want to see characters on screen with whom they can identify. That demand has given me opportunities. I love that, in acting, life is so unpredictable. I had started dating Jason Lewis <i>(who played Smith Jerrod in TV series Sex And The City)</i> before actually watching him in the show. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I did watch it, I was surprised at how naked he was — and how often he had to be naked. I was watching with my mom, going: “Oh my gosh. Yes, that’s my boyfriend.” My mom, of course, was not in the least shocked. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me to care about issues and people. </p>\n<p>\nShe would volunteer to work in crisis centres for women who had been beaten and abused. She also helped in a place called Housing Works, which was an organisation providing housing for families and homeless people living with Aids. </p>\n<p>\nI would help her clear out houses in which people had died so we could bring in someone else to live in reasonable comfort. </p>\n<p>\nMy mom inspired me to think and work for other people.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4324717/Jessica-Alba-will-appear-in-Sin-City-sequel.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jessica Alba to Sin again in 3D"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3580291/Laras-a-very-precious-Stone.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Lara’s a very precious Stone"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/3435941/Rudd-y-hell-shes-got-some-balls.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Rudd-y hell, she’s got some balls"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/ros-620_1564964a.jpg","caption":"Loving ...

Consequently she’s been dubbed “Bride-chilla” as she insists she’s relaxed about the plans, saying: “I do feel like there is a lot of time and nothing needs to be rushed.” </p>\n<p>\nContrast that with Brad Pitt who has turned into a right “Groom-zilla” while planning his wedding to Angelina Jolie. </p>\n<p>\nA source said: “Angelina isn’t so bothered – it’s Brad who is piling on the pressure. He wants everything to be absolutely perfect.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHere, JENNY FRANCIS meets five people who are helping to populate a new wedding dictionary. </p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nBridesmaid-zilla </h4>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\nThe bossy friend or sister </h2>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>DEFINITION:</b> A bridesmaid who controls the wedding as if it were her own, from choosing place settings to picking out the bridesmaids’ dresses and the venue. </p>\n<p>\nFelicity Cross became a bridesmaid from hell when older sister Becky, 29, got engaged. </p>\n<p>\nThe 27-year-old who works in marketing made the bride, a communications consultant, change the colour of the bridesmaids’ dresses. </p>\n<p>\nShe also demanded that Becky run all music and food choices past her for approval, and even insisted that her big sister go on a strict pre-wedding diet. </p>\n<p>\nRefusing to let Becky get married at her first choice of venue because it was “too similar” to where she wants to eventually get hitched, Felicity even picked out candlesticks for the tables for the forthcoming nuptials without consulting the bride. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Felicity, from Leeds, says:</b> “When Becky announced in January that she and Tristan were finally tying the knot I had a feeling that it might cause some friction. </p>\n<p>\n“Just because she was getting married first didn’t give her first rights over everything. I got my way and Becky chose a different venue, changed the bridesmaid dresses to cornflower blue and allowed me to make music choices. </p>\n<p>\n“I tried on her wedding dress to prove she needed to slim down quicker, too. </p>\n<p>\n“I just wanted to be involved in every area I could. But she flipped out when I ordered the candlesticks. </p>\n<p>\n“And I have been trying my hardest to apologise for my bridesmaid-zilla ways.” </p>\n<p>\n<b>Becky says:</b> “Felicity kept pushing to make my wedding hers and I had had enough. </p>\n<p>\n“We’re still very close but I pity the man who ends up marrying her – or the bridesmaid who tries to take over her wedding.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nBride-chilla </h4>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\nThe laid-back bride </h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>DEFINITION:</b> A bride who is so relaxed about life she thinks her wedding breakfast will involve a bacon sarnie. </p>\n<p>\nBride-chilla Alison Jackson has taken a back seat when it comes to her wedding preparations since 26-year-old teacher Matt Carter proposed to her last December. </p>\n<p>\nThe 28-year-old, who works in sales, is so “whatever” about her engagement that she lies in bed on a Sunday morning while her fiancé, friends and family go to wedding fairs to research the big day. </p>\n<p>\nThe Essex bride-to-be says she can’t be bothered stressing about the colour scheme, whether to have pâté or soup for starters or what shoes the bridesmaids should wear for the event next February. </p>\n<p>\nInstead she’s left the decisions up to everyone else and has even ordered the first wedding dress she spotted online. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Alison says: </b>“I’ve always wanted to get married but never dreamt about the details. </p>\n<p>\n“I haven’t got the patience for any indecision so the best solution is to leave it to everyone else. </p>\n<p>\n“My bridesmaids helped Matt with the guest list, catering, colour scheme, their outfits, decorations, transport, flowers and a DJ. </p>\n<p>\n“And Matt’s mum went with him to pick up items from wedding fairs.

They are due to marry next month. </p>\n<p>\nAnd desperate to make the celebrations perfect, Rosemary, 69, from Teddington, south-west London, took over the organisation of her daughter’s big day. </p>\n<p>\nPicking the venue, choosing her outfit months before the bride, sorting the seating plans, making the bridesmaids’ jewellery and arranging the transport, it’s no surprise that Amy calls her mum her “free wedding planner”. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Rosemary says:</b> “I could never be a mother-of-the-bride who leaves all the planning to her daughter and just shows up on the day. I’m a natural organiser and love to get involved. </p>\n<p>\n“I love the Richmond Gate Hotel in Richmond-upon-Thames and dreamed of her getting married there, so I made enquiries. </p>\n<p>\n“I also found the bridal shop where she got her dress. Although I’d bought my outfit months before Amy, I even began looking at a wedding dress for her.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Amy says: </b>“That’s why I call Mum my wedding planner. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s always been very hands-on so I knew long before I got engaged that she’d want to be very involved. </p>\n<p>\n“And I’ve learned to love it.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nGroom-zilla </h4>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\nDon’t worry, he’ll do it all </h2>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>DEFINITION:</b> A groom who takes over the wedding planning from his bride and will stop at nothing to make sure it’s all going his way. </p>\n<p>\nWhen 27-year-old hairdresser Teegan agreed to marry Marcus Lovvell, also 27, little did she know she was about to wed the ultimate Groom-zilla. </p>\n<p>\nSupermarket worker Marcus, from Irvine, North Ayrshire, embarked on a mission that saw him book the church, choose the bridesmaids and even hand-pick Teegan’s wedding dress. </p>\n<p>\nHe kept the majority of the details a secret from his wife-to-be until the day. </p>\n<p>\nMarcus also chose a three-tiered wedding cake in the shape of a pair of lips and sent the wedding invitations out via text message. </p>\n<p>\nDespite his wife-to-be’s pleas to get involved he was convinced it would be better if he sorted it himself. And she says, despite the stress of the lack of control, it was worth it on the day. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Teegan says: </b>“He wouldn’t tell me the location, the food or any details as he wanted to do all the planning himself. </p>\n<p>\n“I was worried not to be involved, especially when he wouldn’t even let me see the dress. </p>\n<p>\n“I was shocked when it was red, but I loved the style. </p>\n<p>\n“My friends and family thought I was mad for letting Marcus control the wedding, but that’s what I love about him, he’s a bit wacky.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Marcus says:</b> “It was stressful and I did turn into a groom-zilla but I wanted Teegan to enjoy the surprise and thought it would be better for me to sort the whole thing. </p>\n<p>\n“And when we finally married we both breathed a sigh of relief and we enjoyed every minute.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nGroom raider </h4>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\nThe mean man </h2>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>DEFINITION:</b> A groom too tight-fisted to splash out on a well-tailored suit and instead relies on a good bargain. </p>\n<p>\nWhen Jack Rawles asked his waitress girlfriend Rachel Quinnell, 22, to marry him, he didn’t have the same big white wedding in mind as she had. </p>\n<p>\nThe 25-year-old project analyst from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, kept his purse strings tightly pulled throughout the planning, even BANNING his wife from wedding shops and suggesting she shop for her dress on eBay. </p>\n<p>\nCancelling the professional decoration company Rachel booked in favour of cheap centrepieces found online, he also booked a local DJ instead of a band and roped in a pal to take the photos. </p>\n<p>\nPerhaps most bravely, he insisted on a budget camping break instead of the dream five-star beach honeymoon his bride-to-be had hoped for. </p>\n<p>\nJack insists shopping for the best deal worked out fine. </p>\n<p>\n<b>He says: </b>“A wedding is just one day, why spend tens of thousands? </p>\n<p>\nIt stressed me out when Rachel wanted to spend money on unnecessary things so I banned pricey items and fancy bridal boutiques. </p>\n<p>\n“The day was perfect. Just because we borrowed chair covers and searched for bargains didn’t make it less special.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe wedding cost £4,350 but Rachel says she would have spent at least £10k. </p>\n<p>\n<b>She adds:</b> “I know he was being sensible but I did feel frustrated with him at times, and a bit cheated out of the whole wedding experience. </p>\n<p>\n“But I had an amazing day in the end – so I guess it doesn’t always matter how much you spend.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/4465417/I-snubbed-my-250000-big-fat-gypsy-wedding-I-could-not-face-living-like-a-slave.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I snubbed my £250,000 big fat gypsy wedding...

Some were so badly sucked in they had lost limbs through the practice of their addiction.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “Ten years ago, I couldn’t get enough — cannabis, booze, speed, acid, coke, crack, smack. I took drugs every single day.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I remember being told that in six months I would end up dead, in prison or a lunatic asylum and thinking, ‘That sounds heavy.’ ”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>But Russell is living proof that the downward spiral can be stopped through sheer determination combined with good emotional and professional support.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Amy Winehouse died last year Russell was inspired to make a new hard-hitting documentary for the BBC about his road to recovery.\n</p>\n<p>\nLast week her ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil suffered multiple organ failure and is now in a medically induced coma after a huge drink and drug binge</a> — bringing an added poignancy to the timing of our chat.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdd that to the recent story of junkie billionaire Hans Rausing — convicted of hoarding addict wife Eva’s dead body</a> — and it backs up Brand’s belief that fame, money and class are no antidote to the condition of dependency.\n</p>\n<p>\nRussell, 37, said: “It’s a subject that’s really close to me and Amy’s death can serve as a catalyst or serve as a symbol that people don’t have to die.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Her death wasn’t inevitable — there was something that could have been done. I know that from my own experience. There are millions like her who have the opportunity to get clean. I wanted to make that film and work with Comic Relief so people could get access to the information on how to do it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ve met people both in addiction and recovery from all sorts of backgrounds and it’s no discriminator.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s more apparent where there is less money because the criminal part of it is more evident, but the Rausing example goes to show that the desperation drugs induce in people who suffer from from addiction goes across the board.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>In the documentary, Russell Brand: From Addiction To Recovery, there is harrowing footage of him smoking heroin in his younger years.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe comic is almost unrecognisable to the man sitting before me in the salubrious surroundings of London’s Savoy Hotel. The footage shows him hunched on the floor of a grotty flat, barefoot and lost in the warm comfort of another hit of smack.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow we are sat in the decadent five-star venue which used to play host to one of the most notorious British hellraising actors of all-time — Richard Harris. He was a man who would have admired Russell’s dramatic and hedonistic rise to fame during his own booze-fuelled heyday, but who died an alcoholic.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoth are effervescent, lively characters with an eye for the ladies.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Russell is a very different man now, and his determination to tackle the thorny issue of addiction — an illness, not a crime in his book — is stoking the fire in his belly.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe explained: “It is a film about taking drugs and getting off drugs. Nowadays I don’t drink or take drugs.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHis beloved mum, Barbara Brand, opens up about her son’s dark years in the BBC3 film, to be shown on Thursday at 9pm. He asks what her recollections of the time were and Barbara, 65, said: “You were helpless. You looked so ill, skinny, not particularly clean, had no pride in your appearance or how you lived. It’s heartbreaking as a mum when you have brought an innocent beautiful little child into the world and to see that happen.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>But Russell has turned his life around spectacularly — with help from some strong characters.</i> </p>\n<p>\nHis agent John Noel forced him to visit Focus 12 residential rehab in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat was the start. Normally this is where a journalist would write, ‘He hasn’t looked back’. But Russell looks back every day to remind himself how worthwhile the effort has been.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I got clean at the age of 27, the age Amy was when she died.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Amy’s death was a paradoxical unsurprising shock. I felt like I could have done something to help — to give her the chance I had. That’s why I made this film — to have a sympathetic look at alcoholism and addiction, a condition that the World Health Organisation regards as a disorder.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Drugs and alcoholism are much misunderstood in our country — by users, non-users and the Government.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We need to start regarding addiction in all its forms as a health issue as opposed to a criminal and judicial issue.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It don’t make no difference to me — the money, the fame, the power, the sex, the women — any of it. I’d rather be a drug addict.\n</p>\n<p>\n“If I didn’t have my programme I would be a drug addict today.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I loved Amy on the basis that I thought she was really, really brilliant. I recognised that this person has got it, she has got this thing. She is not happy, she is on edge.\n</p>\n<p>\n“She drank this glass of champagne and threw it over her shoulder once.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I said, ‘What are you doing that for?’ She said. ‘I was doing it to impress you.’ I said, ‘Well... don’t’, then she started flicking lit cigarettes around the room.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s when I got the sense of the ticking clock and spoke to other people, ‘Hey, we need to do something.’ ”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen he gets excited Russell speaks with the rhythm of a sewing machine at full steam, with a staccato beat to his softly spoken and measured statements.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe continued: “When she died, it was this feeling of, ‘Agh, I knew that was going to happen.’ And I had this flickering sense that I should have done something about that.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I feel a bit guilty that there was nothing I did. Whatever anyone could have done for Amy, now one thing is for sure, no one can do anything — she’s dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There are loads of people who are going to die if they don’t stop taking drugs and drinking. It ain’t necessary — it’s difficult for the individual, it’s difficult for the family and it’s detrimental to society and it’s unnecessary because there is a solution.\n</p>\n<p>\n“For me it’s vital that more addicts get the relevant information, into recovery, change their lives and become drug-free. Amy’s death is tragic, but if we use it as an opportunity to review the way we treat addicts and addiction and alcoholism in this country then it hasn’t been in vain. So her death is sad, but it might not feel so pointless.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe documentary brings some really interesting information to light.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>More than 80 per cent of the British prison population are addicts or have some sort of substance abuse issue — but only one in ten gets any treatment other than methadone to break their habit.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA scheme called RAPt — Rehabilitation of Addicted Prisoners — at a prison in north London, is now proven to work.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf there was more Government funding available, it could be spread out across the country. Russell visits another initiative in Brighton where ex-addicts support each other to re-engage with the community. The local police now estimate that for every one pound spent on rehab programmes, the area benefits from £3 less lost to crime. It’s a dividend that makes rehab worthwhile.\n</p>\n<p>\nRussell said: “I am into this long term. If I can quote from Rocky IV, which I find myself doing more often than I would like, if I can change, then you can change and the whole damn world can change.”\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing Russell does not back is the Department of Health’s methadone programme, which he believes is as worthwhile as “re-arranging the furniture on the Titanic. It doesn’t work. Drug addicts are addicted to drugs, so don’t give them more paid for by the country. Even now if I take tin foil out for a legit reason, I still get that feeling of what it’s like to chase heroin and what the smell is like when it burns. It has to be complete abstinence.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Alcohol is as important to the documentary, and something he had as many problems with in his twenties.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n“It was alcohol that killed Amy in the end. Chip Somers, the head of Focus 12, really believes that, in the next five years, we will see a lot more trouble coming from alcohol.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It is sanctioned and accepted but it’s easy to forget it is lethal.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It destroys lives and has a terrible cultural impact. But alcohol is only really dangerous to alcoholics as drugs are dangerous to drug addicts.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s about having joined-up information available to everyone about the dangers of illegal and legal drugs.\n</p>\n<p>\n“If you know someone who has a problem with alcohol and drugs, direct them towards abstinence-based recovery because it works. There is a solution.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There are plans with Comic Relief to launch a concert with some big names involved, so we have a lot planned to keep this going.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs we leave the hotel, Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger walks through the lobby with a stunning woman on his arm. He extends a nod of recognition to Russell.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Arnie was not in Rocky IV, but acknowledgement from The Terminator in the context of our chat, seems like an appropriate pay-off to our evening.</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nHighs and lows\n</h4>\n<p>\n<b>1975:</b> Russell is born in Grays, Essex, on June 4.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1990:</b> Makes acting debut, playing Fat Sam in a school production of Bugsy Malone.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1995: </b>Given a place at the Drama Centre London, but expelled during his final year.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2000: </b>Begins to enjoy success in stand-up comedy, but struggles with drug and alcohol problems.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2001: </b>Sacked from presenting job on MTV for coming to work dressed as Osama bin Laden the day after World Trade Center attacks.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2002: </b>Spends 12 weeks being treated for heroin addiction in UK rehab centre.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2004:</b> Gets big TV break hosting Big Brother’s Big Mouth and develops a reputation as a ladies’ man by bedding famous beauties including Kate Moss.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2005: </b>Treated for sex addiction in a specialist US clinic.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2007: </b>First film part, as Flash Harry in Brit flick St Trinian’s.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2008: </b>He lands Hollywood roles, playing Aldous Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\n</p>\n<p>\nRussell and Jonathan Ross spark fury with a foul-mouthed phone call to Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs during Brand’s Radio 2 show.

But I watched it since the accident and I couldn’t believe that Pauline Fowler was dead. It’s like a completely different soap.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe death of Princess Diana, 9/11, the rise of the smartphone and the glory days of Britpop with bands such as Oasis had also never happened in her mind. </p>\n<p>\nKay admitted: “When I heard modern music, I was really surprised. What happened to Meat Loaf and Black Sabbath? I do like that Adele woman though.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut it is the loss of the childhoods of her kids that has been the hardest to bear since she slipped on a wet floor at work on July 25 last year. </p>\n<p>\nThe mum of three from Newton, Cambs — who revealed her memory loss in The Sun on Thursday — said: “What kind of mother forgets their children? </p>\n<p>\n“I was convinced my daughter was a stranger having an affair with my partner and I couldn’t even remember I’d given birth to my youngest son. </p>\n<p>\n“My family showed me photographs to try to spark memories. But it’s like looking through a stranger’s family album. </p>\n<p>\n“I feel robbed of my own kids. I can’t even begin to describe my sense of loss I feel every day.” And she still feels too fragile to come to terms with her mother’s death during her lost years. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “When I woke up in the hospital after my accident, I tried to phone my mum. I had no idea she was dead. </p>\n<p>\n“I can’t remember my last goodbye with her, which is extremely painful. </p>\n<p>\n“Her death is something I have put to the back on my mind to deal with when I am stronger.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs well as retrograde amnesia, Kay’s accident also left her with short-term memory loss. She also mixes up everyday habits — she will accidentally use hairspray as deodorant, and make coffee without boiling the kettle. </p>\n<p>\nShe now relies on the Post-it note reminders scattered around the house — and on her partner of five years Robert, 60, He gave up his own car business to be her full-time carer — and has to tell her each morning as she gets up to go to work that she no longer has a job. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I still miss the ‘real’ her. But I never wanted to leave her side.” The two plan to wed next year, and Kay is also looking forward to daughter Sandy becoming a mum in three months’ time. </p>\n<p>\nShe said of learning of the baby: “I was shocked. In my head I’m still in my thirties. </p>\n<p>\n“I still feel like a mother of toddlers so it is hard to get my head around how I should behave as a grandmother. </p>\n<p>\n“But I’m also really excited. It feels like a chance to start a new chapter. It won’t make up for the memories of my own daughter that I’ve lost, but it will help.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>For more information on brain injury, see headway.org.uk</a>.</b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>e.little@the-sun.co.uk</b></a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4477426/Mums-fall-at-work-wipes-20-years-from-her-memory.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Mum's fall at work wipes 20 years from her memory"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/3951766/Brain-tumour-girls-trip-of-a-lifetime.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Brain tumour girl's trip of a lifetime"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4009174/Memory-loss-dad-in-Xmas-Day-wish.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Memory loss dad in Xmas Day wish"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/KAY-620_1565045a.jpg","caption":"Looking to the future ...

I felt like I’d been winded — I couldn’t believe I’d been sharing my life and my bed with a paedophile.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSupport worker Kate had been dating Scott for two years before she invited him to share the home in Saltash, Cornwall, where she had lived with her two daughters and son since splitting from their father three years earlier.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe had met him on a night out with friends in Plymouth in August 2007, when pals dared her to dance with a stranger and she homed in on Scott, who was alone at the bar. Kate recalled: “He wasn’t much of a looker and seemed really awkward dancing but he was polite and a good sport.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We decided to go for a meal a few days later.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When he arrived, he was glowing bright red and his skin was peeling from sunburn after roofing all day.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I couldn’t help but laugh about it and Paul did too. He was always ready to share a joke, even if it was at his own expense.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s one of the things that made me fall for him.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pair were soon constantly texting and phoning and Kate’s feelings for Scott were soon turning serious.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: “It was my first relationship in a while and I wasn’t looking for anything at all, but he really won me over.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I could tell I was falling for him after a few weeks.” Within 12 months, the couple were spending all of their time together and her kids — who are now teenagers — liked him too. In October 2009 they decided to move in together.\n</p>\n<p>\nKate said: “Everything with Paul was easy. I felt so comfortable and secure with him. I thought we knew each other inside and out.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was completely in love and ready to share my life and my family with him.” </p>\n<p>\nSo Kate was excited as she helped him clear out his old place before welcoming him into her home for their first night as live-in lovers.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: “We’d packed all of his things into the car the night before but were too tired to unload them.\n</p>\n<p>\n“In the morning he’d gone downstairs to make me a coffee and was taking for ever.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I called his mobile to joke about how long it was taking, his phone vibrated on the table by me.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I reached over to delete the missed call but accidentally knocked another button and opened the pictures folder.”\n</p>\n<p>\nKate flicked through the photos, smiling as she saw how often she featured. There were snaps of her and Scott together, a birthday cake, and even a picture of her taken the night they met for the first time at the Plymouth club.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I was looking through the pictures and felt really touched. Then I spotted a folder called Other Files.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d never looked through Paul’s phone before — but I became curious and couldn’t help myself.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>She clicked on the folder and it took her brain a few seconds to process what she was seeing — a sick photo of a girl who appeared to be younger than ten.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShaking with disgust, she kept clicking through the files — finding more and more vile images of young girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe recalled: “I was stunned. I felt sick. He was moving in with me and my three children — it doesn’t bear thinking about.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I couldn’t believe that someone so close to me was a paedophile. I knew I had to go to the police immediately.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWith extraordinary presence of mind, Kate swung into action to do what she needed to do — shield her kids, then make sure both Scott and the photos were handed over to the authorities.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe brave mum said: “I told the kids to go to their friends’ houses.\n</p>\n<p>\n“By this stage Paul was in the bathroom and as soon as they had left I began banging on the door.\n</p>\n<p>\n“He seemed really panicked. When I held the phone up and showed him the pictures he started trying to explain.”\n</p>\n<p>\nScott also tried to grab the phone and there was a frantic tussle.\n</p>\n<p>\nKate said: “All I was worried about was keeping him and the pictures in the house until the police could come.\n</p>\n<p>\n“He ran downstairs and I chased after him to lock the front door. I was in such a hurry I didn’t even get dressed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe then locked Scott in the kitchen and dialled 999.\n</p>\n<p>\nKate said: “I was so angry. Never did something like this ever enter my head. I racked my brain, trying to think if I had missed anything. I was thinking of my own children too. Imagine if he had tried to touch them?\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was absolutely distraught but had no doubt about reporting him. What Paul did was disgusting and at that moment all I could think about were the poor girls from the photographs.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPolice were soon on the scene and Scott was taken away in a van while a traumatised Kate gave a statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>But the most difficult moment of the day was still to come.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I had to have the worst conversation of my life with my children. I had to ask them if my partner had touched them.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I had all sorts of nightmares whirring around my head.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I could hardly breathe when I asked them if he had hurt them. That moment was one of the most frightening of my life.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut her kids assured her that he had never approached them. Kate recalled: “That was such a relief.” </p>\n<p>\nCops searched Scott’s possessions and found nearly 400 images of child porn on his phone and a total of four computers, including Kate’s own laptop.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn July last year, Scott, 42, was sentenced to 30 weeks in jail after being found guilty of 13 counts of making and possessing 391 indecent images of children between September 2006 and October 2009.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe will also have to sign the sex offenders’ register for ten years.\n</p>\n<p>\nKate, who gave evidence at the trial, said: “When I saw him in the dock, I felt nothing but contempt for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Anyone who thinks a friend, partner or relative is a paedophile needs to stand up and be counted. Victims and families don’t have to live in the shadows of what these people have done. </p>\n<p>\n\"I got in the witness box and testified with my head held high.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>“That’s one less paedophile who can hurt kids.”</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>j.tippett@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/irishsun/irishsunnews/4478412/Daughter-sues-paedo-dad-and-wins-375000.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Daughter sues paedo dad and wins €375,000"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4463282/I-shopped-my-best-friends-husband-for-being-a-paedophile.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I shopped my best friend’s husband for being a paedo"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4435139/I-was-walked-down-the-aisle-by-my-rapist.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I was walked down the aisle by my rapist"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4411419/My-childhood-diaries-trapped-paedo-teacher.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My childhood diaries trapped paedo teacher"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4326338/Paedos-1000-girl-net-hitlist.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Paedo’s 1,000 girl net hitlist"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/SNF1122A-6201_1564130a.jpg","caption":"Shock ...

Gail has so much to live for. I keep telling her, ‘You have everything going for you. You have an amazing daughter, people who love you — and you are incredibly talented.’\n</p>\n<p>\n“I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if Gail can get healthy she will be able to revive her career. But she doesn’t have many more chances left — and that is why we are keeping everything crossed for her.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDan, 37, opened his heart to The Sun shortly after his ex checked herself into one of the world’s toughest rehab centres last week. </p>\n<p>\nGail will spend the next three months undergoing intensive counselling at a pioneering treatment facility in Cape Town, South Africa</a>. </p>\n<p>\nAs part of the radical programme, her mobile phone will be confiscated and she will have minimal contact with the outside world. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe regime will be a stern test for former Top Of The Pops presenter Gail, 41, who will only be allowed to contact little Honey through the online video service Skype. </p>\n<p>\nBut it will also be an ongoing ordeal for those close to Gail who have had to pick up the pieces. </p>\n<p>\nDan said: “When anyone writes about Gail, I am portrayed as the bad guy who ruined her life or the stay-at-home dad who looks after her daughter while she dips in and out of rehab. </p>\n<p>\n“I have even been blamed for her losing her hair. For years now I have wanted to scream from the rooftops that I am not this horrible person. </p>\n<p>\n“I also want people to know I am not a footnote in her life story. As tough as this has been on Gail, it was far from easy for the rest of us.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDan and Gail were one of the hottest couples of their generation when they married at a register office in her hometown of Edinburgh in 2001. </p>\n<p>\nHe was the guitarist in a band dubbed the “new Oasis” after their Dancing In The Moonlight track hit the charts. She was the TV presenter who became a lads��� mag favourite before her naked image was beamed on to the Houses of Parliament as part of an ad campaign. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey met during a bender organised by Chris Evans after they both appeared on his TFI Friday show. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Dan admits their relationship got caught up in Nineties excess.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “That whole period was a bit of a blur, to be honest. </p>\n<p>\n“I know that during our first year together we were both so busy we only saw each other about once a month. So our relationship was built on pretty flimsy foundations. </p>\n<p>\n“You only have to look at the timeline of our relationship to see what a whirlwind it was. </p>\n<p>\n“We got married and had Honey about a year later. Then I went straight on tour. </p>\n<p>\n“Gail suffered from post-natal depression but, like many men, I struggled to recognise the symptoms. </p>\n<p>\n“Then, when I came back, Gail went off to America to film Dead Famous and I stayed in London with Honey. I hardly saw her for a year. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>“By this point I realised we were different people and knew the end of our relationship was near.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAsked how bad the relationship got, Dan says: “It was fiery but I think some things should be kept private. Her personality is so big it can fill a room. But sometimes the person who talks the loudest at a party is also the least happy.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDan says he and Gail broke up around a year after their daughter was born, although they did not officially divorce for a couple of years. </p>\n<p>\nThat same year — 2005 — Gail revealed she was suffering from the hair loss condition alopecia. She also had her first breakdown. </p>\n<p>\nDespite their divorce, Dan reveals that in the midst of her crisis he was the person she called. He said: “She left a voicemail on my phone and I could tell she was not well. </p>\n<p>\n“I went down to the house and she was not in a good state. I think she might have overdosed on something, although I can’t be sure. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I called for an ambulance and they told me to make sure she stayed awake. I didn’t know what to do so I walked her around the room.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDan has since found happiness with Lynsey, a sports presenter for Al Jazeera Sports and BBC Radio Five Live, who he married in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nDan said: “Lynsey and I met in 2006 in north London when we were introduced by a mutual friend, Chris Moyles. We got married in Lynsey’s home town of Newcastle where Honey was a bridesmaid. </p>\n<p>\n“Lynsey is now a huge part of Honey’s life and they enjoy a really strong relationship.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, 2008 saw a “defining moment” in Gail’s life when she was sectioned after her then boyfriend Jonny Davies reported she was suicidal. She claims she was never serious about taking her own life. </p>\n<p>\nBut Dan says: “I have to take my hat off to Jonny. He was the first person who forced her to get help.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe says he and his wife have provided a level of stability in Honey’s life that Gail appreciates. The couple are now leaving London to live in the countryside with his daughter. But Dan insists this has nothing to do with his ex’s problems. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I would never stop Gail from seeing Honey. Gail likes it that Lynsey gets on so well with Honey. </p>\n<p>\n“Just before Gail went to rehab we all went to Hampstead Heath together for a picnic and Honey and Gail had a really nice time.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: “Gail has been in and out of rehab this year, but obviously it has not worked for her. Honey has dealt with it remarkably well. </p>\n<p>\n“Gail has to complete this programme then stay healthy. I’ve told her, ‘When you get back I want to see the new Gail Porter.’\n</p>\n<p>\n“Gail and Honey have a very special relationship. I know she is not going to let that bond slip away. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“And I honestly cannot wait for the day when she is better.”</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>g.culliford@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4465829/Gail-Porter-on-her-bid-to-conquer-her-demons-by-having-rehab-in-South-Africa.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I put on a brave face but I’m upset and need help ... so I’m quitting Britain for three months of radical rehab"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4181969/Gail-Porter-news-TV-presenter-explains-why-she-is-volunteering-in-a-charity-shop.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Gail Porter: I’ve had lots of fun in my life... it feels good to give a little back"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4099321/Gail-Porter-is-moving-on-from-breakdowns-hell.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Brave Gail's moving on from breakdowns hell"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/dANmAIN_1564357a.jpg","caption":"Support ...

They were dug out of eight different levels beneath the house near the mainly Muslim city of Kazan, capital of Russia’s Tatarstan region on the River Volga.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne report said there was as little as one cubic metre (35 cubic feet) for every three people.\n</p>\n<p>\nA police officer emerging from the bunker said: “It’s an underground prison, a vision of hell, not some Muslim paradise.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe FSB secret service — the successor to the KGB — was also involved in the operation to bring the sect back into the real world.\n</p>\n<p>\nA local TV journalist who inspected the labyrinth said: “Daylight does not reach the cells as all of them are located underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n“This eight-level underground ant hill has about 30 small rooms. Now police are demanding the destruction of the illegal underground compound.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“They will not touch a mosque or the house itself, only the underground premises where people actually lived but which were built illegally.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Gumer Ganiyev — Satarov’s deputy — vowed: “They will come with bulldozers and guns but they can demolish this house over our dead bodies.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA police video of last week’s raid showed bearded male residents shouting as investigators forced their way inside the building.\n</p>\n<p>\nWomen wearing traditional headscarves were highlighted carrying young children, including babies, up a long flight of stairs from deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\nA police officer ordered: “Take these children to a bus.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPolice investigator Ranis Bakhitov said the children were “living in unsanitary conditions. There is a lack of ventilation. The premises are like monks’ cells.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe added: “Based on the evidence of police officers, all the children require medical attention. The space was built as a labyrinth.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe children were said to be basically healthy — but dirty — when they were checked over at hospital.\n</p>\n<p>\nDoctor Tatyana Moroz said: “The children were in satisfactory condition. They were all fed, although they were dirty...\n</p>\n<p>\n“Tomorrow the full analysis will be finished and we will give our final conclusion about the condition of their health.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPolice have charged four members of the bizarre group — called “muammin” from the Arabic word for believers — with child abuse.\n</p>\n<p>\nA wide-ranging probe is now under way into other possible crimes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Astonishingly, the authorities have known of the sect’s existence and the presence of children since 2007, yet failed to act. It was unclear if they had full knowledge of the appalling conditions.</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSatarov somehow managed to slip though the net of first the Soviet Union and later independent Russia.\n</p>\n<p>\nA police source said that in 1996 the cult leader secured land for an Islamic school and “gradually all the members of the sect moved there to live permanently”.\n</p>\n<p>\n“His supporters led a closed way of life, not leaving their shelter without extreme necessity. The children of the commune grew up in the same conditions. They did not go to educational and medical institutions, which is the most severe breach of children’s rights.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA handful of trusted Satarov loyalists had been permitted to work in local markets to earn money for the group.\n</p>\n<p>\nLast night Satarov was said to be “bedridden and delirious” in hospital.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe had declared himself an Islamic prophet in the mid-Sixties during the Leonid Brezhnev era after interpreting sparks from a trolleybus cable as a divine light from God.\n</p>\n<p>\nSatarov, formerly a Muslim mufti <i>(an Islamic scholar)</i>, founded his sect in the Seventies despite curbs on all religious groups in the USSR.\n</p>\n<p>\nHis sect does not recognise Russian state law or the authority of Tatarstan’s mainstream Muslim leaders. His followers were encouraged to read his manuscripts.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe has been charged with “taking the law into his own hands”, said assistant prosecutor Irina Petrova.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe underground mothers and fathers were charged with neglecting their parental obligations.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe children were discovered last week when police searched the sect grounds as part of a probe into the recent killing of a leading Tatarstan Muslim cleric.\n</p>\n<p>\nRadical Islamist groups were blamed but there seems to be no link to Satarov’s outfit.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was known as a fundamentalist and in a 2008 interview he said he fell out with other clerics and authorities in the Communist era.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe KGB allegedly sent him to Muslim nations on propaganda trips spreading stories about religious freedom in the officially atheist Soviet Union. He said: “That’s how I became satan’s servant, a traitor.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I understood that, I repented and started preaching.”\n</p>\n<p>\nKazan-based theologian Rais Suleimanov said: “Islam postulates that there are no other prophets after Muhammad. The teachings of Satarov, who declared himself a prophet, have been rejected by traditional Muslims.”\n</p>\n<p>\nOfficers entered Satarov’s bizarre complex last Friday as they investigated the killing of Valiulla Yakupov, Tatarstan’s deputy chief mufti. He was shot dead last month as he left his house in Kazan.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe sect case echoes that of a 35-member Doomsday sect that holed up in an underground cave in a region south-east of Moscow in 2007, only emerging after the end of the world failed to materialise.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this latest case, the rescued youngsters are in the care of local orphanages. Pavel Astakhov, ombudsman for children, has taken personal charge of ensuring that they can overcome their ordeal.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “Unfortunately, the victims of the sect will need professional rehabilitation over a fairly long period. The sect member parents must first undergo treatment before they are reunited with the children.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>These children may have been rescued from a living hell — but they could spend a lifetime recovering.</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4472975/Stars-back-punks-who-dared-to-take-on-Putin.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Stars back punks who dared to take on Putin"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4477124/Russian-daredevil-does-pull-ups-from-360ft-tower.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"A Russia blood to the head – daredevil does pull-ups from 360ft tower"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4475540/Traffic-chaos-as-bloke-in-shopping-trolley-blocks-busy-road.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Traffic chaos as bloke in shopping trolley blocks busy road"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/CULTM-620_1563490a.jpg","caption":"Depraved ... sect leader Faizrakhman Satarov"},{"uri":"images/CULT-620_1563495a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/HOUSE-620_1563494a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/CULT4-620_1563493a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/CULT3-620_1563492a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/CULT2-620_1563491a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/ECT-620_1563496a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Life or death ... postcode lottery sees some cancer patients denied treatment","image":"images/drip-620_1563548a.jpg","section":"woman","headline":"We need help first","teaser":"TWO women reveal the impact it has had on their lives","timestamp":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 00:52:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nPM David Cameron has come under fire for the £11.5billion the Government spends on foreign aid while patients here are denied life-saving drugs. </p>\n<p>\nAs a guest on London’s LBC radio, he was played a recording left for him by a cancer sufferer called Anna, 68, from Finchley, north London. </p>\n<p>\nShe sobbed: “No foreign aid is being cut, and I’m waiting for treatment that’s not on the national health.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA postcode lottery means hundreds of patients are denied life-saving cancer treatment on the NHS — while others are given it for free. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Here,</i> <b>LYNSEY HAYWOOD</b> talks to two women about the impact it has had on their lives. </p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nYvonne, 57, from north Wales </h4>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRETIRED council worker Yvonne Briscoe lives in Brynford, north Wales, with her husband Michael, 61. </p>\n<p>\nShe rents a flat 53 miles from her home so she can access bowel cancer treatment. </p>\n<p>\nYvonne says: “I first started suffering symptoms in 2008 and my doctor thought it was irritable bowel syndrome. </p>\n<p>\n“By the time I got diagnosed the cancer had spread to my lungs and my liver. </p>\n<p>\n“I started chemo at Glan Clwyd Hospital.

He says: </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was 16, I was introduced to steroids by a friend. I could exercise harder and for longer, I packed on lean muscle and the girls flocked to me. I soon became hooked. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a professional rugby player in South Africa, I either injected or took oral steroids every day. </p>\n<p>\nI grew “bitch tits” because of the excess oestrogen in my body. I had them surgically removed. I had terrible acne on my back and my testicles shrank to the size of peanuts. </p>\n<p>\nBut this seemed a small price compared with the attention, money and glamour of being so ripped. </p>\n<p>\nAfter I retired from rugby, I became a model and stuntman in the US. I soon became addicted to cocaine, which cost £300 a day over eight years. </p>\n<p>\nEverything changed one evening in 1997 when I was cooking dinner for my wife and my heart exploded. </p>\n<p>\nMy aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, had split in half. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI faced having my legs amputated, which were miraculously partially saved by a surgeon, and all the organs in my body died. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a coma for a month and intensive care for two more, needing more ops to replace my aorta with a plastic one. </p>\n<p>\nMy wife left me because she’d been told I’d almost certainly be brain dead and paraplegic. </p>\n<p>\nI spent two years in bed recuperating, needing round-the-clock care, then five years in a wheelchair, very slowly learning to walk again. </p>\n<p>\nI was told I would never be a father but got married and we had a girl who’s now six. </p>\n<p>\nAll I want now is to share my story so other people don’t do what I did. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nDennis, 29 </h4>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>DENNIS DX, who is single and from Nottingham, is a TV extra who has appeared on EastEnders, Holby City and Shameless.

You inject them into your bum — it’s quite awkward. </p>\n<p>\nI got free needles from a needle exchange used by heroin users as well as steroid users. </p>\n<p>\nI had injections twice a week, at a cost of £8 a shot. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to up the dose but it can be very bad for the heart. </p>\n<p>\nThey worked better than the tablets though and are supposed to be less harmful to your liver. </p>\n<p>\nI didn’t tell my friends and family I was taking steroids as I would be embarrassed that I was taking harmful products just to make myself look better. </p>\n<p>\nI eventually stopped in 2010. It was making me very aggressive. </p>\n<p>\nI would get into fights in pubs and did some things I regret. If someone said something, I would react in a violent way and I wouldn’t back down. I didn’t like the person I was becoming. </p>\n<p>\nI had on-off partners. If they noticed my aggression problems I would move on. </p>\n<p>\nI looked good and there were plenty of fish in the sea. </p>\n<p>\nSteroids didn’t shrink my penis or cause any hair loss, but they did affect my mood. </p>\n<p>\nFriends were wary of me, as I could flip over something minor. </p>\n<p>\nEventually, when I stopped taking them, I told a few friends why I had been so aggressive and apologised. </p>\n<p>\nI still work out five times a week. </p>\n<p>\nI do miss my perfect body but steroids weren’t worth it. </p>\n<p>\nI hope I stopped before the long-term effects took hold, but do worry I might have problems later in life. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nCol, 40 </h4>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>COL WOOD, a former chef from Rugby, Warwickshire, fears taking steroids made him go blind in one eye. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI’ve always loved playing rugby — I was never that big, weighing just 12st, but I always made up for that with my determination and strength. Certainly nobody ever messed with me on the pitch, but I suffered lots of injuries as a result. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I got to around 32 the injuries started taking their toll, I wasn’t as fit as I used to be and I decided to take steroids. </p>\n<p>\nI didn’t want to be some huge muscle-head, I just wanted to keep playing rugby at the level I was used to — I guess it was as much about my ego as anything. </p>\n<p>\nI knew a few bouncers in the area, all of whom took steroids to get big, and through one I trusted got hold of some tablets and some liquid to inject. </p>\n<p>\nOf course my wife Dawn, who’s a nurse, objected strongly but she knew I was going to do them whatever she said. </p>\n<p>\nWithin a matter of days I felt bigger and stronger and after my first course, which lasted about six months, I was up to 14st and loving my rugby. </p>\n<p>\nI was lifting huge weights and knocking over guys almost twice my size. There were downsides, of course — I got really bad acne on my back and I noticed myself snapping all the time at the smallest irritation, although I knew never to snap at Dawn, who’d warned me I’d be out if I did. </p>\n<p>\nBut that all seemed a price worth paying. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I got my second course of steroids, through the same doorman, that all changed. This batch was a mix of four different steroids but because I trusted the guy who got them for me I went with it. </p>\n<p>\nIt was almost the opposite of the first time — I got the shakes, almost like DTs or having flu. </p>\n<p>\nI couldn’t eat, I felt utterly terrible and lost more weight than I’d put on in the first place, going down to just 10st. </p>\n<p>\nI came off the steroids pretty quickly, but it was like they’d put my body into shut-down mode, and I didn’t recover. </p>\n<p>\nI had to retire from playing rugby almost straight away. </p>\n<p>\nIt’s one of the main problems with steroids — they’re always imported and you never know what you’re putting into your body, so when it goes bad it goes really bad. </p>\n<p>\nIt doesn’t seem to matter what I ate or did, that weight wouldn’t come back on. </p>\n<p>\nCoincidentally I also developed the rare eye disease uveitis then. Within months I was almost completely blind in my left eye and had to stop work as a chef. </p>\n<p>\nSince my eyes have gone bad I’ve made it a real mission to work out ways people with disabilities can play sport — through the charity Fight To Walk I raise funds to provide prosthetic limbs. </p>\n<p>\nOf course I wish I’d never taken steroids — but through all the people I meet now with disabilities I know life is too short and precious to wallow in self pity. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/olympics/4432926/David-Cowan-gives-Olympics-best-drug-testing-system-ever.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Cheats will NOT win gold"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/boxing/4420123/Dereck-Chisora-Im-clean.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Chisora: I’m clean"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/euro2012/4362823/Ukraine-in-drugs-row-on-eve-of-Euro-2012-opener-with-Sweden.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Ukraine’s pain over drug row"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/4348993/WWE-star-Randy-Orton-suspended.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"WWE star Orton suspended"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4478677/Sports-can-be-a-real-pain.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Sports can be a real pain"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4479149/Every-part-of-your-body-wrecked-by-fizzy-drinks.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Is Britain going pop?"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/SNF09H4MAN---_1562986a.jpg","caption":"Ignoring the dangers ... many body builders proceed with steroids even though they know the risks"},{"uri":"images/SNF09DEN_1562989a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/SNF08MIKE2-_1562987a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/SNF09H4ILL---_1562985a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/SNF09H4ED--_1562984a.jpg"},{"uri":"images/SNF09H4COL--_1562982a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Bronzed Britain ... map shows tanning hotspots","image":"images/SNF09WOMAN_1563130a.jpg","section":"woman","headline":"15 shades of tan","teaser":"SURPRISE result of survey shows Oxford winning the battle of the bronzed — as ladies tan FIVE times a month","byline":"By JENNY FRANCIS","timestamp":"Thu, 09 Aug 2012 00:41:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nSTEP aside, Essex, there’s a brand new bronze capital of Britain – Oxford. </p>\n<p>\nIt seems the well-to-do ladies in the city of dreaming spires are determined not to be left in the shade when it comes to slapping on the fake bake.

The drinks also appear to raise the risk of heart disease, liver failure and hypertension. </p>\n<p>\nThis week, we ask if it’s time to end our love affair with fizzy drinks. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THIRSTY Brits guzzle around 14billion litres of soft drinks every year – and consumption has more than doubled since the mid-Eighties. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut now there are mounting fears that the country’s addiction to the fizz poses a serious health threat. </p>\n<p>\nA new report by scientists at Bangor University shows sugar-laden drinks change the way the body’s metabolism works, potentially increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. </p>\n<p>\nAnd a series of other damning studies have found excessive consumption can damage virtually every part of your body. </p>\n<p>\nMost consumers fail to realise just how much sugar these drinks contain, says Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George’s Hospital, London. </p>\n<p>\nIt is sugar, rather than other ingredients, that does the bulk of the damage. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “When people consume these drinks, they don’t think of the calories involved. Yet a can of soft drink can contain seven to ten teaspoons of sugar. </p>\n<p>\n“That triggers a rapid rise in blood sugar, which makes the body produce more insulin to try to dispose of it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pancreas, the organ which manufactures insulin, has to work harder to cope with the sugar load, which increases the chances of it malfunctioning, triggering diabetes. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe British Soft Drinks Association say 60 per cent of fizzy drinks sold in the UK are diet, low-calorie or no-added-sugar versions. </p>\n<p>\nBut that means we’re still guzzling more than 5.5billion litres of the “bad” kind. </p>\n<p>\nCountries including France and Denmark have imposed taxes to cut consumption. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Here Sun Health looks at what pop is doing to our bodies.</i>\n</p>\n<h3>\nSKIN </h3>\n<p>\nTOO many fizzy drinks could make you look old before your time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA 2010 Harvard University study found that phosphate – a mineral which makes many soft drinks taste tangy – accelerated the ageing process in mice. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHigh doses withered the skin and muscle. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLevels tend to be even higher in the diet versions of fizzy drinks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere is no direct evidence it does the same in humans, but experts advise: “Avoid phosphate toxicity.”\n</p>\n<h3>\nBONES </h3>\n<p>\nTHREE or more cola-based drinks a day can thin the bones and raise the risk of osteoporosis, according to research by Tufts University in the US. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd it’s not just because they tend to replace milky drinks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nScientists now think that phosphoric acid used in these drinks, whether diet or full fat, may disrupt the balance of calcium – vital to build strong bones – meaning it is lost from the body. </p>\n<h3>\nTOES </h3>\n<p>\nGOUT was once a problem solely for fat Victorian gents but recently it has made a comeback. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd one reason may be soaring fizzy drinks consumption. Scientists at the University of British Columbia found the agonising toe condition was 85 per cent more common in men who drank two or more cans a day. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey blame fructose, a type of sugar used in drinks that raises levels of uric acid in the blood – the main trigger for gout. It’s in fruit juice too, though the benefits of drinking fruit juice outweigh any risks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>\nBRAIN </h3>\n<p>\nJUST one full-sugar fizzy drink a day may be all it takes to affect behaviour. </p>\n<p>\nLast year, a US study found teenage boys were up to 15 per cent more likely to be aggressive, violent and carry weapons if they had at least one daily can of pop. It tallies with other research suggesting poor nutrition may be a cause of antisocial behaviour. </p>\n<p>\nResearchers said: “There was a significant association between soft drinks and violence.”\n</p>\n<h3>\nTEETH </h3>\n<p>\nFOUR cans of fizzy drinks a day raise the danger of tooth erosion by a whopping 252 per cent, according to a study in the British Dental Journal. </p>\n<p>\nAnd going for a diet drink option probably won’t help either. It’s not the sugar that strips tooth enamel but the citric acid – the chemical that gives oranges, lemons and grapefruit their bite. </p>\n<p>\nThis is used in some drinks and also corrodes the tooth surface, causing pain and sensitivity. </p>\n<h3>\nHEART </h3>\n<p>\nSUGAR in fizzy drinks is thought to be the main threat to health. But experts at the University of Miami say the diet options may be just as bad, if not worse, when it comes to heart attacks and strokes. </p>\n<p>\nThey quizzed 2,500 people and found those downing just one diet soda a day were 61 per cent more likely to have cardiovascular problems than those avoiding the drinks. </p>\n<p>\nIt is not yet clear why diet drinks have this effect. </p>\n<h3>\nLUNGS </h3>\n<p>\nAS unlikely as it sounds, fizzy drinks may even adversely affect the lungs, increasing the risk of getting asthma. </p>\n<p>\nResearchers at the University of Adelaide surveyed nearly 17,000 people and found those who drank the most “full-fat” cola, lemonade or flavoured mineral water had the highest rates of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – an incurable lung condition that is often associated with smoking. </p>\n<h3>\nPANCREAS </h3>\n<p>\nTHE pancreas – which is behind the stomach – pumps out insulin to help muscle cells burn sugar for fuel. </p>\n<p>\nBut just two full-sugar fizzy drinks a day can double the chances of developing pancreatic cancer. </p>\n<p>\nOne of the most lethal types of tumour, it killed Apple founder Steve Jobs last year. Sugar is to blame because boffins at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute found adding a couple of spoonfuls to tea or coffee also increased the dangers. </p>\n<h3>\nUTERUS </h3>\n<p>\nSUGARY drinks could raise the risk of pre-eclampsia, a potentially deadly condition that kills around 1,000 premature babies a year in the UK. </p>\n<p>\nMums-to-be were found to be 27 per cent more likely to develop it if they downed pop every day. </p>\n<p>\nAffecting up to one in 20 pregnancies, pre-eclampsia occurs when blood vessels in the placenta do not develop properly. This can reduce oxygen and nutrient transfer to the baby. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4478677/Sports-can-be-a-real-pain.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Sports can be a real pain"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4478300/Statins-are-dodgy-change-in-diet-better-for-the-heart-say-experts.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Statins are dodgy, change in diet better for the heart, say experts"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4478338/Man-boobs-rages-and-shrivelled-testicles-True-cost-of-steroid-abuse.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Man boobs, rages and shrivelled testicles"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/pop_1563187a.jpg","caption":"Brit pop ... enjoying drink"},{"uri":"images/drink_1563189a.jpg","caption":"Drink worries ... fizz is not good for you"}]}},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"The old bills ...

The number of women aged under 30 who are filing for bankruptcy is also on the increase, the report found. </p>\n<p>\nHere <b>NIKKI WATKINS</b> and <b>JENNY FRANCIS</b> talk to two women about the reality of being hit by bankruptcy in your 20s. </p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nAnne Scales, 30\n</h4>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ANNE lived a glamorous lifestyle on borrowed money, ending up £19,000 in debt. The single saleswoman, from Surbiton, Surrey, was declared bankrupt in November last year. She says:</b> </p>\n<p>\n“My problems began when my parents gave me a credit card to take to university for emergencies. </p>\n<p>\nI was skint one month and my friend suggested I use it to buy a few bits I needed. I suddenly realised I had thousands of Pounds right there at my fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIrresponsibly, in just a few months, I’d splashed out on clothes, nights out and make-up. </p>\n<p>\nWith my friends coming from rich backgrounds, I felt under pressure to live the same kind of lifestyle. </p>\n<p>\nDespite having a student loan, my money quickly disappeared on a monthly £50 gym membership, £60 phone bill and nights out spending £150 on booze. </p>\n<p>\nMy boyfriend always wore designer clothes and I felt scruffy next to him. Worried he would go off me, I went on shopping sprees to Selfridges, spending £200 a time. </p>\n<p>\nI also bought an Apple Mac for £700 because everyone else had one. </p>\n<p>\nI had two credit cards maxed out to £1,000, a £3,000 overdraft and a loan of £4,000. For holidays I went to exotic places like Egypt, Greece and Barbados. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I left university in 2002, I was in £9,000 of debt. It was silly but when I got a job in sales I felt pressure to keep up with the money my co-workers were spending and went on expensive nights out. </p>\n<p>\nDespite working for a company who sold credit cards, I very rarely thought about my debt. </p>\n<p>\nMy first job in sales earned me £12,000 a year which was swallowed up by rent, council tax and bills. So when the bank called me and asked if I wanted to get a £7,000 loan to consolidate my debts it sounded like a good idea. </p>\n<p>\nI then had all the cards free so was able to spend on them again. </p>\n<p>\nI told myself when I got a good job I’d start paying the loans back properly, rather than just paying back the minimum as I was. </p>\n<p>\nAnd I was allowed to increase the limits on the cards to £5,000 on one and £3,000 on the other. </p>\n<p>\nBut when I did manage to get a better job in sales, earning £3,000 a month after tax, I still only paid back a little over the minimum. </p>\n<p>\nKnowing I was paying off some of it helped me convince myself it would eventually disappear. </p>\n<p>\nI was even allowed another £10,000 loan from HSBC — they said it would help me pay off my debts. </p>\n<p>\nIt wasn’t until I was 27 and had been in debt for eight years that I started to worry how I was going to pay the money back. I had no income, as I lost my job, and no way to pay back all the companies that were hounding me. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I worked out my debt, it came to £18,000 over two credit cards, loans and overdrafts. I was terrified. </p>\n<p>\nI told my family and they suggested I contact someone for help so I sought advice from the Citizens Advice Bureau. They recommended I file for bankruptcy. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was declared bankrupt in November it was terrifying to hear those words. I thought of bankrupt people as being irresponsible and was embarrassed about the state I had got myself into. </p>\n<p>\nNow I can’t get a mortgage or apply for any loans or credit for at least six years. </p>\n<p>\nI am still unemployed and have been looking for work for more than a year. I can barely go out or afford to buy myself a lipstick. </p>\n<p>\nThis is not where I saw myself being at the age of 30.\n</p>\n<h4 align=\"center\">\nSarah-Jane Lynch, 25\n</h4>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>SARAH-JANE was declared bankrupt at just 20 when she found herself £14,000 in debt after recklessly spending on three credit cards. The student, from Edinburgh, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nMy problems with money started when I left school aged 17 and took up a part-time job at a post office.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI lived at home with my parents rent-free, so I spent a lot of money on clothes.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nWhen I was 18 I became a sales co-ordinator for a house builder.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI took out a credit card with a limit of £1,000 to help fund clothes shopping and nights out and I maxed it out.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nWith money coming in from my £13,000-a-year salary I just about managed the minimum payments each month.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIn the run-up to Christmas 2005, and needing money for presents, I applied for three credit cards thinking I’d only get approved for one. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe cards had a combined balance of £4,800 and, to my complete surprise, I was accepted for all three.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI don’t know what came over me, but I went into a spending frenzy.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIt felt like it was my money and I blew nearly all the cash on lavish Christmas gifts and clothes for myself.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThen the repayments started coming through.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIn January 2006 I was forced to take out a £4,000 loan, aiming to pay off as much of my credit card debt as possible.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI managed to pay off £1,000, but then my car got damaged and I was forced to use the other £3,000 for repairs.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI was left with monthly repayments of £273 for the loan and a £200 minimum payment on the £4,300 credit card debt. On top of my living costs it was impossible to balance the books.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI was too scared to tell my parents, so I just buried my head in the sand. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nStupidly the only thing that made me feel better was shopping to excess. I obtained a catalogue account and used up the £500 limit, a credit card and overdraft which amounted to £2,000, and a Capital One credit card with a £500 limit and spent it all on clothes and make-up. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBut then the phone calls and letters started.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI couldn’t afford the repayments and tried to hide them hoping it would all go away.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBy May 2007 I was getting threatened with legal action.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI was terrified of the post arriving and dreaded answering the phone in case it was a debt collector. At breaking point and not being able to see a future without financial troubles, I decided enough was enough.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSo I entered into a trust deed — a Scottish alternative to bankruptcy — in June 2007.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI was more than £14,000 in debt and I felt that it was my only way out. My debt was wiped and I had to pay £3,600 in £100 monthly repayments over three years. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. And although I felt bad about not paying the money back, I saw no other way out. I knew I’d been silly and irresponsible.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI couldn’t get any form of credit or have a bank account during this time, but I discovered a small savings bank in Scotland who didn’t run credit checks.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI managed to get a new account and started managing my finances properly, which has meant I was able to go into business.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nNormally you can’t have your own business if you have been declared bankrupt.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nI have just finished an honours degree in business at Edinburgh Napier University and I’m about to launch a skincare brand this summer.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBeing declared bankrupt in my twenties was terrifying and I’ve well and truly learned my lesson.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4480266/My-holiday-cost-9k-six-of-that-was-for-a-tummy-tuck.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My holiday cost £9k ...six of that was for a tummy tuck"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4415520/Shopaholics-who-have-spent-30000-on-clothes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"We’re secret spenders"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/4391406/Bride-Tina-Elliott-and-groom-Marc-Botterill-on-how-they-got-dream-wedding-for-50.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"We got married for just £50... £44.50 of it went on the licence"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4356517/Shopping-addiction-ruined-my-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"I used bloke’s credit card to spend £2,000 on 20 dresses.

From Danny Boyle’s rich and quirky opening ceremony to last night’s celebration of our long musical heritage, it has been a triumph.</p>\n<p>Despite all the usual scare stories, the closer we got to the start of it all, the more we became enthused.</p>\n<p>Personally, as we now wave the XXX Olympiad “au revoir”, I have to confess this has been the most life-affirming sporting extravaganza I have ever experienced.</p>\n<p>It has been the most uplifting time in our island history for 67 years or so, the reclaiming of a national identity not seen since millions packed the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace at the end of the Second World War.</p>\n<p>Over the last three weeks we have seen Great Britain reborn and at its best.</p>\n<p>At the centre of it all have been the crowds that have flocked to every single event, cheering on not just the home athletes who have accumulated the largest tally of gold medals in over a century but every single competitor.</p>\n<p>None more than Sarah Attar, who became the first woman in Saudi history to compete in track and field. The 19-year-old may have finished her 800 metres heat some 45 seconds behind the winner but she received the greatest ovation of all.</p>\n<p>Yet Attar was ignored by nearly all the media outlets back in Saudi just as Wojdan Shahrkhani had been in the first week when she became the first Saudi Olympian when she competed in the judo.</p>\n<p>Instead, attention focused on the bronze medal won by the showjumping team led by a member of the Saudi ruling family.</p>\n<p>And what reward for the two brave girls who defiantly stood up against the awful degradation and repression in their country?</p>\n<p>They were abused, told they would be shunned from here-on in and that they had sacrificed their place in the after-life.</p>\n<p>So three more cheers for Sarah and Wojdan, two true golden girls.</p>\n<p>The support for the Games has been truly outstanding. We first noticed it on the opening Saturday when the streets of London and the Surrey countryside were mobbed by almost 1.5million people as they came out in their droves to support the men’s road race.</p>\n<p>We really could have been over the other side of the Channel watching the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>We always joke about being proud to be British but that was one of those moments.</p>\n<p>Then there was the ear-splitting roar that greeted Jess Ennis on the morning of her first appearance in the heptathlon — the first day of a track and field programme that was sold out every day for the first time in Olympic history.</p>\n<p>It sent a shiver down your spine.</p>\n<p>So did the reception later that evening for Ethiopia’s Tirunesh Dibaba when she retained her 10,000 metres title.</p>\n<p>There was no particular reason for hats to be thrown into the air and the roof raised but it still happened.</p>\n<p>Again, you felt so proud of everyone for their sportsmanship, fair play and the fact they were having such a stupendous time.</p>\n<p>And then there were the individual moments. Double gold winner Charlotte Dujardin winning the blubbing gold after the dressage in Greenwich.</p>\n<p>As I said, it was the Waterworks Olympics.</p>\n<p>Some people say “whatever happened to the stiff upper lip?”</p>\n<p>Well, we’ve changed — and for the better. We are no longer all closed up and afraid to show our emotions.</p>\n<p>That’s why we saw big men like Chris Hoy dissolving at the first note of the national anthem.</p>\n<p>And then there was lovely Victoria Pendleton, her bottom lip forever quivering. And all those rowers.</p>\n<p>Best of all was Kat Copeland crossing the line at Eton Dorney with partner Sophie Hosking and yelling: “We’ve won the Olympics, we’re going to be on a stamp!”</p>\n<p>What moments, what memories. Tear-jerkers like Gemma Gibbons winning her judo semi, remembering her mother Jeanette who had died of leukaemia eight years earlier and pointing to the sky and saying “I love you, mum.”</p>\n<p>And Steve Redgrave lifting a shattered Mark Hunter out of his boat and hearing the distressed rower apologising for “only” winning silver.</p>\n<p>And the stoic agony of open-water swimmer Keri-Anne Payne, in the Serpentine for almost two hours in the most brutal race of all — and losing out on a bronze by half a second.</p>\n<p>Then there were the supreme moments of outstanding individual excellence — Usain Bolt, Mo Farah, Bradley Wiggins, Kirani James winning Grenada’s first-ever gold in the men’s 400 metres at just 19 and the peerless Kenyan David Rushida becoming the only man to break 1min 41sec in the 800m. And the USA women’s 4x100 squad dismantling the East German record that had stood for almost 30 years.</p>\n<p>And in the last track and field event of them all, Bolt and his Jamaicans shattering the men’s 4x100 relay record. Then there were the ever-smiling, ever-courteous volunteers. And the Armed Forces personnel who made you feel that much safer.</p>\n<p>And what a triumph for Coe, the man who made it all work.</p>\n<p>And now it’s all over. And back to reality.</p>\n<p>Real heroes to be replaced by mediocrity and Roo and Jay Tee. And non-entities like TOWIE, Big Brother and the rest of the Z-listers.</p>\n<p>But for 17 glorious days of summer we basked in real achievement. Real heroes from home and abroad.</p>\n<p>All of us — athletes, organisers, volunteers, a watching, thrilled and enthused public — deserve a pat on the back.</p>\n<p>This, surely, has been our finest hour.</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"images/TeamGB_940x450_1565187a.jpg","caption":"OUR HEROES ...

Unfortunately it’s come, or hopefully will come, due to an injury to Joe but if I get the chance it will be a dream come true. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s something I can’t stop thinking about and I’d love the chance to be able to perform on that stage on Wednesday night. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m not going to try and put too much pressure on myself or expect anything because there’s not a lot of goalkeepers who get the chance at such a young age. I’m very privileged to be in this position. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m going to take everything in my stride. If it doesn’t happen on Wednesday I’m going to work harder to make it happen on a different occasion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nButland, who was part of England’s Euro 2012 Squad in Poland and Ukraine, also believes the experience of playing for Team GB at London 2012 will prove invaluable as he continues his development. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “It was fantastic for everyone involved. I feel very proud and privileged that I was given a chance to be able to perform and be a part of something bigger than just football. </p>\n<p>\n“You were given the chance to mix with other athletes, it was a very good experience to see how all the other sports do it and just get a feel for the Olympics. It’s something I won’t forget.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: “The Euros were fantastic and it was a great experience to see and train with top players and it was a big eye-opener for me and showed me where I want to be for long periods of my career.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, Manchester United midfield ace Tom Cleverley is looking to put last season’s injury woes behind him and hit the ground running as he too looks to make his England debut on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “It was a bit of frustrating season for me. </p>\n<p>\n“It always is for a footballer to be injured and not to be able to do what you do. But I’m not thinking about that now. I’m getting my head down and hoping to play as much football as possible, whether that be for England or Manchester United.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4484043/Injured-Joe-Hart-clears-the-way-for-Jack-Butland-debut.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Hart injury clears the way for Jack"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4482926/Roy-Hodgson-wants-Three-Lions-to-have-Olympic-spirit.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Roy’s Olympic spirit"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4482935/Jack-Butland-goes-up.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"One day I’ll be in England squad"}],"image":[{"uri":"images/buck_1565536a.jpg","caption":"PROUD ...

The Premier League is back. </p>\n<p>\nAnd better still, that means Dream Team has finally returned to our lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere at HQ, we have been studying the form guide and picked XI red-hot tips from the stars who have dazzled in pre-season.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd we have even left £500,000 in the bank, which is sure to come in handy in the four transfer windows.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn goal we chose Mark Schwarzer (£2m), who is still firmly No1 at Fulham and has kept five clean sheets in seven pre-season games. </p>\n<p>\nIn front of Schwarzer, we have gone for two old favourites with an eye for a goal. </p>\n<p>\nNewcastle’s Steven Taylor (£2.5m) and John Terry of Chelsea (£6.5m) have both netted this pre-season. </p>\n<p>\nWith them is Nemanja Vidic (£6.5m), who is back in the reckoning for Manchester United – and, with 30,000 picks so far, for Dream Team bosses too.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLiverpool veteran Jamie Carragher (£3.5m) makes up this experienced back four. </p>\n<p>\nTwo big summer signings help form our four-man midfield. Spurs new-boy Gylfi Sigurdsson (£3.5m) and United’s Shinji Kagawa (£4.5m) have both made fine first impressions for their new clubs by getting off the mark in pre-season. </p>\n<p>\nChelsea legend and Dream Team points hoarder Frank Lampard (£6.5m) and Man City’s Samir Nasri (£4.5m) also make the cut. </p>\n<p>\nWe have some surprising choices for our deadly strike duo – all thanks to some advice from our @dreamteamfc</a> Twitter followers.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany of you called for Arsenal’s Gervinho (£3m). The Ivorian has been in top form this summer, scoring two in four games, but has only made it into 0.3 per cent of Dream Teams so far. Worth a gamble? </p>\n<p>\nAlongside Gervinho is City ace Carlos Tevez (£6.5m), who dazzled in City’s victory over Chelsea in the Community Shield.\n</p>\n<p>\nSee if any of these players really are peaking at the right time, and choose your <b>FREE</b> Dream Team. You haven’t got long though, so get over to www.dreamteamfc.com</a> <b>NOW</b>, as it all kicks off this Saturday. </p>\n<p>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"images/shin_1565539a.jpg","caption":"SHIN THE MOOD ...

In terms of delivering world-class events, Britain is at the top of its game right now, so capitalising on this within the UK and around the world is clearly a priority. </p>\n<p>\nPlans are already in place with the Government to help take advantage of this moment and to ensure this opportunity is not lost. </p>\n<p>\nWe are already seeing many UK businesses who worked on the Games picking up contracts with other major events. </p>\n<p>\nYou can do your bit too. If your kids were inspired by Mo Farah, Laura Trott or Ben Ainslie, find a local club, enrol your child and enrol yourself to be a volunteer. </p>\n<p>\nOne of the enduring impressions of these Games was the immense pride felt by the families and friends of athletes who competed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI said in my speech at the Opening Ceremony that “one day we will tell our children and our grandchildren that when our time came we did it right”. </p>\n<p>\nWe did it right, so thank you to every Sun reader who came to our Games, every Sun reader who volunteered, who watched and cheered as Team GB brought home medal after medal. </p>\n<p>\nThese Games brought out the best in us and will help define us on a global scale. </p>\n<p>\nBut, of course, our job is only half done. In a couple of weeks’ time we host the world’s second biggest multi-sport event — the Paralympic Games. </p>\n<p>\nThis is another opportunity to inspire a generation and shine a light on more inspirational sport. </p>\n<p>\nBelieve me, these are athletes who will make you sit up and take notice. </p>\n<p>\n<i>And once again, I am sure with The Sun’s support, Team GB will shine.</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"images/coe_1565057a.jpg","caption":"RIGHT ROYAL SUCCESS ...

It’s an option, though I have not yet talked to my coach Alberto Salazar about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I think Alberto will probably say it’s too early for the road, keep to the track. But if I feel I am losing my speed on the track, I will go in that direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Things are going well and as an athlete you want to be able to collect as many medals throughout your career as you can. So I want to keep going now. Championships don’t come around that often.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFarah has huge admiration for Salazar, though the Cuban-born former athlete, famed for winning the three successive New York Marathons in the 80s, came in for criticism when Farah failed to win a medal at the World Indoors in Istanbul in March.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet the 54-year-old’s methods ultimately worked to perfection, with Farah able to run the last lap of each London victory in 53 seconds to repel the chasing pack.\n</p>\n<p>\nFarah stated: “Alberto is a genius. That last lap has been the difference, One or two per cent.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ve always had it but I just haven’t been able to finish races. Now I am finishing races strongly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“They were queuing up to pass me and I could feel that but I was not going to let anyone past me. It’s an incredible feeling.”\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday London 2012 chairman Seb Coe, who with arch-rival Ovett dominated the 800m and 1500m in the 1980s, claimed Farah was Britain’s greatest-ever runner.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Farah added: “No way. Athletes like Coe and Ovett won medals and broke records all the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I just leave it to the public to judge things like that and get on with my running.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Usain Bolt had to defend both his Olympic titles to be a legend. But I can play around with different events, so it’s hard to compare.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“To be a legend like him you have to go from track to world records and the marathon. There is lots to be done.
