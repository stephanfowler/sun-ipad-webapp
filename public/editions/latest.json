The 18-month-old YouTube footage shown on French TV features him driving a BMW and ends with the cold-blooded killer grinning broadly into the camera. </p>\n<p>\nMerah slaughtered rabbi Jonathan Sandler, 30, his sons Gavriel and Aryeh, six and three, and principal's daughter Miriam Monsonego, eight, at Ozar Hatorah School on Monday. </p>\n<p>\nThe maniac  who days earlier had killed three French soldiers  was cornered yesterday when armed cops surrounded his first-floor flat in a Toulouse suburb. </p>\n<p>\nMerah said he would post online videos of Monday's rampage with an Uzi machine pistol and handgun and other attacks before surrendering. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe footage  shot with an HD camera strapped to his chest  is believed to include images of him chasing and executing terrified Miriam in the playground. </p>\n<p>\nWhen cops told him to surrender, the shaven-headed killer shouted \"I can see you\" and fired through the letter box, shooting one officer in the shoulder and another in the leg. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, authorities revealed his older brother Abdelkader Merah, 27, had been arrested. </p>\n<p>\nThe younger brother told negotiators his sprees were revenge on Israel for killing Palestinian children, and on France for sending troops to Afghanistan and banning burkas. </p>\n<p>\nHe was known to anti-terror cops and was on a \"watch list\". </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<a href=\"mailto:n.parker@the-sun.co.uk\">n.parker@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"From NICK PARKER in Toulouse","teaser":"A GUNMAN who slaughtered four victims at a Toulouse school is dead after a 32-hour siege.","headline":"Toulouse killer is dead as 32-hour siege ends","section":"news","id":4210549,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4210549/Toulouse-killer-is-dead-as-32-hour-siege-ends.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNN2217ANNN---5322_1475551a.jpg","subdeck":"Smiling ... first picture of killer Mohamed Merah","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":false},{"isTop":1,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"The Wrong Trousers ... but at least Chancellor's saving Wallace & Gromit","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/21_03_2012--_1475347a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNN2204A--_1475433a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNN2204B-_1475432a.jpg"}],"video":[{"caption":"CHANCELLOR George Osborne delivers statement in Commons","uri":"4xbzM4NDpumhtrRqa5oJjCi85FXJkBxD"},{"caption":"LABOUR leader launches ferocious attack in response to Osborne's speech","uri":"ZwYzM4NDo4s7cJYUzrzaE4JQwswdgOJY"},{"caption":"CHANCELLOR George Osborne sticks to planned rise in price of petrol","uri":"85MTQ4NDpJL6aWsS6DXyi1SJlNYtd_bT"}],"article":[{"caption":"Budget 2012 offers crumb of comfort for workers","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4210526/Budget-2012-offers-crumb-of-comfort-for-workers.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Gran Theft Osbo","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4210497/Gran-Theft-Osbo.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"TANKS A LOT, GEORGE","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4209349/BUDGET-2012-TANKS-A-LOT-GEORGE.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Terry butcher","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/4207932/Terry-butcher.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Don't be a fool ... cut fuel","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4208049/Dont-be-a-fool-cut-fuel.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Council's tax bills to be frozen next year","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4210628/Councils-tax-bills-to-be-frozen-next-year.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"articlebody":"<p>\nGEORGE Osborne clobbered the masses of hard-grafting Brits yesterday in a Budget that boosted super-earners. </p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor snubbed millions who begged him to keep fuel prices in check. </p>\n<p>\nHe was slammed for hitting pensioners with a \"Granny Tax\" and putting a hefty 37p on a packet of cigs. Yet he helped those pocketing more than &#163;150,000 and let comfortably off middle-class families keep child benefit. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Find out how the Budget affects you with our calculator at bottom of page</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe gave tax <b>RELIEF</b> to makers of hit films like Wallace and Gromit's The Wrong Trousers. </p>\n<p>\nAnd struggling Sun readers were hit with a double whammy as he whacked <b>MORE</b> tax on a raft of simple pleasures. </p>\n<p>\nIn a Budget that was a particular blow to hard-pressed motorists, the Chancellor: </p>\n<p>\n<b>REFUSED</b> to scrap plans for a 3p fuel duty hike due in August and ruled out trimming the levy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>FAILED</b> to reverse a real-terms pay cut for Armed Forces personnel, despite a plea from top brass. </p>\n<p>\n<b>HIKED</b> tax on tobacco by five per cent above inflation from 6pm last night, putting 37p on a packet of ciggies, and <b>SLAPPED</b> a 20 per cent price rise on popular shop grub like hot sausage rolls by making it liable to VAT. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the same time, Mr Osborne made a significant U-turn on axing child benefit for families raking in good salaries. </p>\n<p>\nAnd wealthy earners making more than &#163;150,000 a year got a big leg-up when he cut the top band of income tax from 50p to 45p. </p>\n<p>\nIt prompted Labour leader Ed Miliband to brand the Chancellor's measures \"a millionaires' Budget\". </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTax reliefs were also handed to lavish TV productions like Downton Abbey, animated hits such as Wallace and Gromit's The Wrong Trousers, video game firms and the film industry. </p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne also triggered anger among small firms by ducking another chance to enforce a dramatic push for economic growth by making no attempt to tackle stifling employment law red tape. </p>\n<p>\nBut he did produce some good news by raising the personal income tax allowance for most earners to &#163;9,205. </p>\n<p>\nThe 40-year-old Chancellor allowed himself a rare grin when he held up his red box outside 11 Downing Street  leading critics to dub him The Smiling Assassin. He spoke in the Commons for 58 minutes. And he declared: \"This Budget rewards work. The country borrowed its way into trouble  now we're going to earn our way out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he failed to convince motorists faced with emptying pockets to fill tanks and those who depend on cars to make a living. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun's cabbie Grant Davis, who switched from Labour to Tory at the last election, called the Budget \"a betrayal\". The London taxi driver added: \"This is a proper kick in the teeth for anyone who has to drive anywhere for a living, not to mention anyone who enjoys a smoke. </p>\n<p>\n\"It makes me wonder why I voted for this lot. When was the last time Osborne filled up a Ford Focus? They obviously don't understand the working man after all.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBritain already has the highest tax on fuel in Europe, with 60p in the Pound going straight to the taxman. The AA called the impending petrol price rise \"a body blow\" and said the VAT hike would negate 21 per cent of the nation's income tax cut on its own. Campaigning Conservative MP Rob Halfon added: \"Lower earners are facing fuel poverty.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne also ignored the six former Forces chiefs who signed an open letter in The Sun last week begging him to exempt servicemen and women from the one per cent public sector pay rise freeze  effectively a wage cut once inflation is taken into account. </p>\n<p>\nIn a bid to soften the blow, the Chancellor announced a &#163;115million spend on a range of moves for the military such as extra council tax relief and housing improvements. On child benefit cuts, he performed a major climbdown by announcing the handout will only be withdrawn from higher rate taxpayers if someone in the household earns more than &#163;50,000. </p>\n<p>\nTo avoid a \"cliff-edge\" effect, it will be eased in at one per cent for every extra &#163;100 earned. </p>\n<p>\nThat means 750,000 middle class families will keep some money  paid for by all taxpayers  even if one member of the family makes as much as &#163;60,000. </p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne slapped VAT on all hot food bought from supermarkets or other shops, prompting livid bakery chain Greggs to threaten legal action against the Government. </p>\n<p>\nHe also whacked the levy on sports nutrition drinks and static caravans used for holidays. </p>\n<p>\nEven Right-wing think tanks attacked the hike on smokes. </p>\n<p>\nThe Adam Smith Institute's executive director Tom Clougherty dubbed it \"petty and vindictive\". And he said: \"Such taxes are already extremely regressive, hitting the poorest the hardest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Deputy PM Nick Clegg hailed the Budget as a victory for his Lib Dem party, which pushed for the income tax threshold increase. </p>\n<p>\nHe declared: \"There are many winners and indeed losers in any Budget. This is a Budget every Liberal can be proud of.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<a href=\"mailto: t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk\">t.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\"></h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nYou're at-a-glance Budget guide </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1>\nFuel duty unchanged </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA BLOW for drivers as the Chancellor refused to axe plans for August's 3p-a-litre fuel duty hike.

Osborne said the 50p rate harmed the economy and raised \"next to nothing.\" Ed Miliband accused him of producing a \"budget for millionaires.\"\n</p>\n<h1>\nGranny tax </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSOME 4.5million pensioners hit by a &#163;3bn \"granny tax\" hidden in Budget. Current &#163;10,500 tax-free allowance falls in line with new income tax threshold of &#163;9,205. It costs oldies &#163;63, rising to &#163;197 for future pensioners. </p>\n<h1>\nIncome tax threshold </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMILLIONS will be able to earn &#163;9,205 a year before paying any income tax. Tax-free threshold will rise &#163;630 to &#163;8,105 next month, then by &#163;1,100 in April 2013, leaving basic rate taxpayers &#163;220 a year better off. </p>\n<h1>\nChild Benefit </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOSBORNE did a U-turn to appease well-off voters. The benefit will now start to be withdrawn when earnings hit &#163;50,000  and removed entirely at &#163;60,000. The embarrassing climbdown has cost him &#163;750million. </p>\n<h1>\nFags </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA PACK of 20 rose 37p from 6pm last night. Mr Osborne said it was an incentive to quit.

At one point her husband walked by oblivious to what was happening. </p>\n<p>\nThen 31, she was punched repeatedly in the face as she tried to resist and was told if she looked at his face she would be killed. </p>\n<p>\nChillingly, she had heard her husband walk past during the assault close to their flat which left her with mental health problems until her death. </p>\n<p>\nErwin said in evidence: \"That really upset me because the shed was so close - two metres away. I could have stopped it happening but as he had his hand over her mouth restraining it, she couldn't call out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGerman-born Imiela, 57, was also found guilty of indecent assault and buggery over the attack which he committed knowing he faced jail over a string of armed robberies carried out after he lost his job as a plasterer. </p>\n<p>\nHe was sentenced shortly afterwards to 14 years in prison and released in 1996 when he found work on the railways. </p>\n<p>\nBut by 2004 he was back behind bars after raping seven women and children in a \"savage and perverted campaign against total strangers\" in 2001 and 2002. </p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Prostitutes</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nColleagues later recalled how he bragged about using prostitutes and boasted over a fling with a girl he said looked only 12. </p>\n<p>\nDays earlier he had driven to Birmingham and kidnapped a 10-year-old girl at knifepoint before putting her through a five-hour sex ordeal in his car. Suspicions grew his stories were really tales of his sex attacks. He also suggested the little girl might have \"deserved it\". </p>\n<p>\nHe got seven life sentences for attacking children as young as 10, 13 and 14 and women as old as 52. He often chose to attack near the M25 motorway which led to him being dubbed \"the M25 rapist\". </p>\n<p>\nAfter that trial he wrote to his son, confessing: \"I cannot control my sexual urges. I'm a man, you must understand that sometimes you have no control over your impulses.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Mrs Jankowitz was assaulted, DNA matching was in its infancy and it wasn't until a cold case review was carried out in 2009 that a match was found. </p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Bloodied</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHer mother-in-law also gave evidence, as did her daughter Charlene who was meant to have been in bed but recalled, aged 10, seeing her mum through the banisters with bloodied clothes saying she had been raped. </p>\n<p>\nIn evidence sicko Imiela told the jury he had \"made love\" to her and at one point lost his temper with the prosecutor, calling him a \"jumped up little ****\". </p>\n<p>\nHis later attacks all echoed the first. </p>\n<p>\nHe would grab his victim where they walked before dragging them to a secluded spot where he assaulted them. </p>\n<p>\nImiela was given a minimum term of eight years for his later attacks and became eligible for parole this month  but Judge John Bevan QC said he is as dangerous now as he was when he was sentenced. </p>\n<p>\nJailing Imiela for 12 years, he told him: \"I find this case saddening, not only because Sheila Jankowitz's life was blighted from at least 1990 onwards by mental illness until her murder in 2006 but I also find your approach saddening, surprising as it may seem. </p>\n<p>\n\"You are wholly unrepentant about your life of guns, rape and general violence and, despite having served eight years of your life sentence, you have not expressed one jot of remorse.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You remained silent until you knew she was dead and then you tried to use that to your advantage.\"\n</p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 11:07:46 +0000","byline":"By NEIL MILLARD","teaser":"SICK Antoni Imiela sentenced to 12 years over horror 1987 stranger rape","headline":"M25 Rapist guilty of eighth ordeal","section":"news","id":4211399,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4211399/M25-Rapist-Antoni-Imiela-guilty-of-eighth-rape-ordeal.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/Antoni-Imiela_250_1475692a.jpg","subdeck":"M25 rapist ...

That will cost them &#163;197. Well-off pensioners will not be affected by the changes because they do not receive pensions tax relief. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Find out how the Budget affects you with our calculator at bottom of page</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAround 4.5million will be affected straight away  rising to five million by 2015. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Mr Osborne presented the change as a much-needed simplification of the tax system  without revealing the impact it will have on old people. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt will save the Treasury &#163;3.3billion by 2016 and affect around half of all Britain's pensioners. </p>\n<p>\nBut it also overturns a reward for OAPs which was first introduced by Winston Churchill when he was Chancellor in 1925. </p>\n<p>\nFurious campaigners last night accused Mr Osborne of \"an outrageous assault on decent middle-class pensioners\". Saga director general Ros Altmann said: \"This Budget contains an enormous stealth tax for older people. </p>\n<p>\n\"Over the next five years, pensioners with an income of between &#163;10,500 and &#163;24,000 will be paying an extra &#163;3billion in tax while richer pensioners are left unaffected. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Budget is terrible news for pensioners.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJoanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said pensioners were the \"biggest losers\" in the Budget. </p>\n<p>\nShe added: \"This will come as a blow to millions of pensioners who have paid into the tax system throughout their working lives.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners' Convention, said: \"The decision to freeze the age-related personal tax allowances effectively means around five million pensioner taxpayers will no longer get additional reductions in their tax over the coming years, while those on the top rate of tax will see their bills reduced. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Many older people will feel they are being asked to forego their reduction in tax to help out the super-rich. There's no fairness in that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLabour also attacked the move.Shadow Treasury Secretary Rachel Reeves said: \"George Osborne has tried to bury his &#163;3billion Granny Tax raid on pensioners. And he added insult to injury by dressing up a tax grab as a 'simplification' and claiming he was taking this money away from pensioners as they could not understand the allowances they were entitled to.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"Pretending that pensioners will be grateful because it will simplify their tax is a vain hope.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTreasury Secretary Danny Alexander described the change as \"a necessary simplification\". </p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"I think it is a fairer system to have the same income tax personal allowance for everybody in this country. </p>\n<p>\n\"Within the context of everything that we are doing for older people, I think it's a fair change.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable denied there was a tax hike for pensioners. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Their allowances are not increased in the same way that those in work are being increased, but it isn't an increase in taxation. </p>\n<p>\n\"And we need to remember that pensioners will benefit from the massive increase  &#163;5.30  in the pension this year.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"We are taking a decision that the best way to help pensioners is through the triple lock  guaranteeing increases in the state pension. There is a goal of a simpler tax system and a simpler personal allowance system.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>There was some good news for pensioners in the Budget.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne announced plans to introduce a new single-tier state pension of around &#163;140 a week for all OAPs, based on contributions. </p>\n<p>\nJoanne Segars said: \"The new state pension will take millions of people off means-tested benefits. It will encourage people to start saving and to save more for their old age. </p>\n<p>\n\"A simple, more generous state pension will be a major step forward in tackling the nation's pensions crisis. And it will ensure that auto-enrolment, due to start later this year, is a success.\" </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nEconomy </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE Chancellor warned Britain's fragile economic growth could be derailed by the euro crisis and rocketing oil prices. </p>\n<p>\nUK growth will be 0.8 per cent next year, 0.1 per cent higher than predicted last autumn, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. </p>\n<p>\nBut Mr Osborne stressed the OBR is warning turmoil over the euro \"remains a major risk to our forecast\". The stand-off with Iran over its nuclear aspirations could also trigger damaging oil price rises.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor got bad news hours before the Budget when it emerged the Government borrowed &#163;15.2billion last month  <b>DOUBLE</b> City predictions. </p>\n<p>\nDespite this, the forecast for total borrowing in 2011-12 is &#163;126billion, around &#163;1billion less than previous estimates. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nJobs </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nUNEMPLOYMENT will peak this year at about 2.8million and not start falling until 2013. </p>\n<p>\nThe jobless rate will rise from 8.3 to 8.7 per cent in 2012, the Office for Budget Responsibility said, adding that unemployment will drop to around 2million by 2016. </p>\n<p>\nIt also warned of a long-term jobless problem for a generation of youngsters. The unemployment rate for 18 to 24-year-olds is up eight per cent from 2008 The overall jobless rate is three per cent higher. The OBR also predicts 730,000 civil service jobs will go from 2011 to 2017, 20,000 more than past forecasts. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nTransport </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nHOLIDAYMAKERS must shell out eight per cent more in airport taxes from next month. </p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne sparked fury by failing to axe a planned hike in air passenger duty on April 1. A family of four flying to Florida will have to pay &#163;260 in APD  up from &#163;240. </p>\n<p>\nThe tax has soared by 225 per cent for flights to the US since 2005 and 360 per cent for flights to Oz and South America. </p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor also paved the way for a \"Boris Island\" airport in the Thames estuary, ann-ounced rail improvement plans for the North and vowed to limit hikes in road tax. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nArmed Forces </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nGEORGE Osborne risked a furious backlash from Our Boys and Girls last night by refusing to overturn his decision to cap their pay. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun revealed last week how six former Armed Forces chiefs were demanding he lift the one per cent pay cap in the Budget. </p>\n<p>\nBut the Chancellor made no reference to the issue. That was despite him trumpeting the fact that the Government's decision to pull out of Afghanistan will save the Treasury &#163;2.4billion.

yesterday  while ordinary workers settled for just a helping hand. </p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor slashed the 50p highest band to 45p. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Millions of other employees had to make do with a modest &#163;220-a-year boost as their tax allowance was raised.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne announced workers will be able to earn up to &#163;9,205 a year before income tax  offsetting some of the pain of impending fuel hikes. </p>\n<p>\nAround 24million workers will benefit and two million low-paid will be taken out of tax altogether. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Find out how the Budget affects you with our calculator at bottom of page</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Chancellor also sneaked out proposals to drag 300,000 more people  including police sergeants and senior nurses  into the 40p higher rate. </p>\n<p>\nIn a little-noticed move, he cut the amount people earn before paying the 40p rate from &#163;42,475 a year to &#163;41,450. Mr Osborne declared his Budget \"supports working families and those looking for work\". Defending the top rate cut for those who earn more than &#163;150,000  brought in by Gordon Brown two years ago  he said it raised \"next to nothing\" and harmed the economy. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Ed Miliband slammed the move. </p>\n<p>\nIn a fiery Commons outburst, the Labour leader said the Chancellor had handed a &#163;42,500 tax cut to 14,000 people who earn more than &#163;1million a year. He said a banker on &#163;5million a year would see his tax bill slashed by &#163;240,000. </p>\n<p>\nMr Miliband added: \"After today's Budget, millions will be paying more while millionaires pay less.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe called the move \"the Government's very own bankers' bonus\". </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Miliband challenged the Chancellor, David Cameron and other Cabinet ministers on the front bench to \"put their hands up\" if they benefited from the 50p tax cut. He went on: \"Just nod if you're going to benefit from it, or shake your head if you're not. Come on, we've plenty of time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Miliband went on: \"A year ago the Chancellor said in his Budget speech, 'Now would not be the right time to remove the 50p tax rate when we are asking others in our society on much lower incomes to make sacrifices.'\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"That is exactly what he has done: tax credits cut, child benefit taken away, fuel duty rising  and what has he chosen to make his priorities? For Britain's millionaires, a massive income tax cut each year.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Chancellor dismissed his attacks. He said the 50p rate raised around &#163;1billion  but only &#163;100million would be lost if it was cut to 45p. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne said he will raise five times more by cracking down on tax loopholes instead. </p>\n<p>\nThese include raising the stamp duty on homes worth more than &#163;2million to seven per cent. </p>\n<p>\nThe increase in the tax-free threshold is the biggest ever. The amount people can earn before paying income tax was already due to rise by &#163;630 to &#163;8,105 next month. It will now increase another &#163;1,100, in April 2013. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<i><a href=\"mailto: g.wilson@the-sun.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">g.wilson@the-sun.co.uk</a></i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nHow it affects you<br></br>\n</h1>\n<p>\nSUN readers from all walks of life are affected by this year's Budget. </p>\n<p>\nHere we see how this year's reader panel will fare under the measures announced by Mr Osborne  and their verdict. </p>\n<p>\nThanks to accountancy firm PwC for their assistance. </p>\n<h2>\nNEET - Lurlene McDermott-Dixon<br></br>\n</h2>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THUMBS UP:</b> JOBLESS Lurlene, who gets &#163;170 benefits a fortnight, was pleased to hear about business loans for the unemployed.

And he's still borrowing &#163;150billion more than he thought he would in June 2010. </p>\n<p>\nThe big question is: What is going to happen to our economy? When is it going to start growing again? </p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor thought the economy would be growing quite strongly by now when he did his first Budget but we are basically flatlining. American growth is twice what our growth is. </p>\n<h1>\nmyView<br></br> </h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h6>\nBy NORMAN LAMONT, Tory Chancellor 1990-1993 </h6>\n<h6>\n<br></br>\n</h6>\n<h6></h6>\n<p>\nTHE Government are sticking to their most important task  cutting the sky-scraping debts left by Labour. </p>\n<p>\nThis was a Budget for growth  relaxing planning laws, cutting Corporation Tax to help companies invest and, yes, cutting the top rate of tax. </p>\n<p>\nThe most eye-catching announcement was the largest ever increase in personal allowances, benefiting 24 million people. </p>\n<p>\nAll in all, this was a well-balanced package.

But so far, no action. </p>\n<p>\nWith the economy in a fragile state, firms need more help to take on new staff.

But the prosecution claims witnesses have linked bullet casings matching those that killed the men to Tyson and says he was often seen carrying a gun matching the one that is believed to have been used. </p>\n<p>\nDefence lawyers say there is nothing to link the teenager directly and several witnesses have changed their evidence because of deals offered by the prosecution. </p>\n<p>\nMr Kouzaris and Mr Cooper left a nightclub called the Gator Club at around 2am on April 16 last year. </p>\n<p>\nResidents in Newtown heard shot around 2.56am and when emergency services arrived the men were found on either side of the road. </p>\n<p>\nMr Brodsky said: \"In a grassy patch they would find James Cooper, shirtless, clutching his shirt in his hand, his blue jeans that he was wearing would be found pulled down about mid-thigh level. </p>\n<p>\n\"Police would also find that James Cooper still had his wallet in his possession, he still had his money in his possession, he still had his cellphone and his camera in his possession. </p>\n<p>\n\"Directly across the street from James Cooper the police would find the body of James Kouzaris, and James Kouzaris would be found with his pants pulled down to the thigh level. </p>\n<p>\n\"He would also be shirtless and police and fire would find his shirt tucked into the back of his pants. </p>\n<p>\n\"But as they found James Cooper, they would find James Kouzaris had his wallet and he had his money still in his possession.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Cooper was shot four times. Three bullets went straight through his body. </p>\n<p>\nThe fatal shot went into his chest, perforated his left lung and ended up in his heart. </p>\n<p>\nMr Kouzaris was shot twice in the back, and was killed by a bullet which perforated his spleen, diaphragm, left lung and his heart. </p>\n<p>\nThe court heard the bullets were from a 0.22 calibre weapon. </p>\n<p>\nThe trial continues. </p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 15:12:18 +0000","byline":"By STAFF REPORTER","teaser":"'TEEN gunman shot Brits dead on holiday when they said they had no money'","headline":"Slaughtered Brits found half dressed","section":"news","id":4211959,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4211959/Slaughtered-Florida-Brits-James-Kouzaris-and-James-Cooper-found-half-dressed-after-being-shot-by-Shawn-Tyson-court-hears.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/James-Cooper-and-J_1475837a.jpg","subdeck":"Gunned down ...

The race will be held over 56 laps, a total distance of 310.408km. The race starts at 4pm local time on Sunday, March 25, which is 9am UK time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>On the Button: </b>Jenson Button's win in Australia was the 13th of his career, bringing him level on the all-time list with fellow Brit David Coulthard and late Italian champion Alberto Ascari. Another win here would bring him level with Jack Brabham of Australia, Britain's Graham Hill and Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lucky omen 1:</b> The last time McLaren won the opening race of the season was 2008 with Lewis Hamilton, who went on to win the drivers' championship that season. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lucky omen 2:</b> Since 2002, the winner in Australia has ended the season as champion on seven occasions. The exceptions were David Coulthard in 2003, Giancarlo Fisichella in 2005 and Button in 2010. Maybe Jenson can put that right this season. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Poles apart:</b> Lewis Hamilton's pole position in Melbourne was the 20th of his career. Vettel took 15 pole positions in 2011, the most anyone has achieved in a single season. Red Bull took 18 poles last year, a record for a team. Ferrari's last pole was with Alonso in Singapore in September 2010. Australia marked the first time since 2010 that a Red Bull driver had failed to qualify on the front row. It was also the first all-McLaren front row since the 2009 European Grand Prix in Valencia. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Red alert:</b> Ferrari have won five of the 13 races held at Sepang. Michael Schumacher has started on pole five times at Sepang and won three of those races, all while driving for Ferrari. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>No point: </b>There are three F1 teams who are still waiting to celebrate their first ever chamionship point: Caterham (formerly Team Lotus), Marussia (formerly Virgin racing) and HRT (who didn't even get to compete in Oz). </p>\n<p>\n<b>Seventh heaven: </b>Five of the last 10 races at Sepang have been won from pole. Nobody has ever won from further back on the grid than seventh, when Kimi Raikkonen won for McLaren in 2003. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Previous winners:</b> Of all the drivers rolling up for this wekend's race, Fernando Alonso (2005, 2007), Jenson Button (2009), Kimi Raikkonen (2003, 2008), Michael Schumacher (2000, 2001, 2004) and Sebastian Vettel (2010, 2011) have all won in Malaysia. </p>\n<p>\n</p>","timestamp":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 17:09:26 +0000","teaser":"OUR complete video and stats package preview to this weekend's Grand Prix","headline":"SunSpeed 2012: Malaysian Grand Prix preview","section":"sport","id":4209825,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/motorsport/4209825/SunSpeed-2012-Video-and-stats-guide-to-the-F1-Malaysian-Grand-Prix.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/Sepang_1475165a.jpg","subdeck":"HOT STUFF ...

Sure, City created enough chances early on but they did not have the confidence to take them.</p>\n<p>Nasri hit the bar, Mario Balotelli was in on Cech but failed to finish it off, Sergio Aguero passed instead of shooting  and so it went on.</p>\n<p>And all this against a Chelsea defence without John Terry and minus the injured Branislav Ivanovic, head and shoulders their best player recently, who limped off after just 21 minutes.</p>\n<p>It did not seem to be getting much better after the break.</p>\n<p>In fact, it got demonstrably worse on the hour when Gary Cahill's shot took a slight deflection off Yaya Toure and wrong-footed Joe Hart.</p>\n<p>It seemed big-night nerves had finally got the better of City  even on their own patch.</p>\n<p>Now they were playing more like the team who had dropped 18 points away from home rather than the one with a 100 per cent record from 14 games at the Etihad.</p>\n<p>Even the simplest of passes were going astray, along with a few players who had joined the missing list.</p>\n<p>And then City got their big break  a volley from Pablo Zabaleta inside the box striking sub Michael Essien on the hand and Aguero equalising from the spot.</p>\n<p>On came Tevez and, well, read all about it.</p>\n<p>You are not quite sure how much more of this the City faithful can take.</p>\n<p>Even with a team costing &#163;450million, they are still to be convinced life has not got a sting in its tail.</p>\n<p>But this is the way it has been down the years at City.</p>\n<p>It is obviously something to do with living in United's shadow for so long.</p>\n<p>Even when the Bell, Lee and Summerbee team were capturing the title in 1968, United were trumping it by winning the European Cup.</p>\n<p>The only surprising thing last night was the way in which the home fans got so easily disgruntled with what they were watching  and making it so obvious.</p>\n<p>This was, after all, a City side who were in the process of becoming the first Premier League side to win 20 consecutive matches at home.</p>\n<p>This was, after all, a club who were just treading water before untold millions suddenly landed in their laps.</p>\n<p>I suppose it all remains a little bit confusing for a set of supporters who are still half expecting their sheikh to up sticks and hightail back to the desert.</p>\n<p>And so it goes on. The agony and the ecstasy.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"mailto:steven.howard@the-sun.co.uk\">steven.howard@the-sun.co.uk</a></p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"<img src=\"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00361/HOWARD_361687a.jpg\"/> By STEVEN HOWARD","teaser":"STEVEN HOWARD says City need a serious improvement to trouble United next month","headline":"Nasri calms City's nerves","section":"sport","id":4210486,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4210486/Samir-Nasri-calms-Manchester-Citys-frayed-nerves.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/nasri2_1475522a.jpg","subdeck":"CHEST THE JOB ...

I blamed the bad smells on the dog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nConstantly banning herself from the food she loves has made Alison's adult life a misery. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My hatred of being big has meant I have spent every day on a dieting roller coaster. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a fad diet junkie. It has become an addiction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Alison's first diet memory goes back to when she was just 13. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll never forget the anxiety I felt when a shop girl told my mum there wasn't a school dress big enough for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I squeezed into the size they had and trundled off to secondary school tugging at the hemline in embarrassment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter being called \"fatty\" in that first year at school, Alison embarked on her first diet. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum had the Scarsdale Diet book and for six weeks I had grapefruit for breakfast, protein and salad for lunch and protein and veg for tea. </p>\n<p>\n\"Although I was always starving and grumpy, I stuck to it and lost a stone over the summer holidays and hit my goal weight of 8st. </p>\n<p>\n\"Even though I wasn't as skinny as some of my friends, I was just so happy to have been accepted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as soon as Alison stopped the diet plan, she shot back up to 9st, large for her 5ft 6in frame. </p>\n<p>\nSo she was actually <b>HAPPY</b> when she contracted glandular fever at the age of 16. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost a stone effortlessly  I was thrilled. I battled to stay that size but the weight I'd lost on the 'Glandular Fever Diet' didn't stay off. </p>\n<p>\n\"As soon as the biscuit barrel was in sight, I piled on the weight.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison's obsession got worse when she found even quicker fixes. Within six months of turning 19, she had tried the Fit For Life Diet, the Egg And Grapefruit Diet and the Banana Diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I even tried the Lunch Box Diet. The idea is that you fill a lunch box up with lots of healthy food. That was great... until I started replacing the salad with chocolate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring her twenties, Alison's weight fluctuated between a healthy 9½st and 10st  but she longed to be a stone lighter again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA turning point in her dieting nightmare came when she married Frank, a photographer, now 48, in 1988 when she was 22. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost half a stone through a combination of nerves and WeightWatchers but, again, it didn't stay off. Within a year, I'd gone to almost 11st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison got desperate and started the meal replacement Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Within two months I was down to 8½st but, boy, it was hard. It was worth it though. I was slim and loving it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYo-yo dieting her way through the Eighties, Alison would spend hours researching gimmicks to keep herself below 10st  until she became pregnant for the first time in 1991. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I embraced eating for two and indulged in whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I looked massive. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was more than 14st when I gave birth to Charlie, who is now 20.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Afterwards, Alison got straight back into her fad diet cycle and spent a fortune on books and consultations to get back down to her beloved 9st. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she explains: \"Just as I hit the 10st mark, I found out I was pregnant with baby No2. </p>\n<p>\n\"Again, I ate for Britain. This time I was 13½st when I gave birth to Olivia in 1995.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce more, Alison threw herself into a host of different diets. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"You name it, I tried it. I'd feel motivated at the beginning and lose a few pounds but then I'd have a blip and pig out for a few days before embarking on another 'new' diet, telling myself this would be 'the one'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison did not manage to slim down before becoming pregnant again in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nThe cycle of gorging and dieting continued after daughter Florence was born in 2001, and Alison flitted between 11 and 12½st. </p>\n<p>\nTwo years ago, Alison's husband told her he was worried because her stomach was bigger than her bust. </p>\n<p>\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan had worked for her in the past and, amazingly, she lost three-and-a-half stone in just three months. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"At last I was 10st again.

Sian, 20, who lives with her parents in Welwyn, Kent, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdam was such a fit young man that even now it's hard to accept he died so suddenly. </p>\n<p>\nWe were enjoying a family holiday in Cyprus. Just minutes before he died, Adam had been laughing and playing water volleyball. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then he said he felt unwell. He got out and sat on the side of the pool  before suddenly collapsing head first into the water. </p>\n<p>\nMy parents and I had gone for a walk and a friend of Adam's dashed to find us. By the time we got back, Adam had been pulled out of the pool. </p>\n<p>\nAn ambulance was on its way and a nurse was desperately giving him the kiss of life, trying to restart his heart. </p>\n<p>\nNow we know Adam had had a cardiac arrest. Tragically, it was too late to save him. </p>\n<p>\nTwo post-mortems  one in Cyprus and one in the UK  confirmed he died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nFor years we believed it was something peculiar to Adam. Then two years ago Cry, The Sudden Death Charity, suggested the family should all be screened. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum Julie, 50, had heart checks first  and, astoundingly, was diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nCommonly associated with Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, it is an inherited condition that affects the heart's rhythm. A year later I too was diagnosed with it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a shock to realise this syndrome was undoubtedly responsible for Adam's death in 2004 and the deaths of many other young people. </p>\n<p>\nWe then discovered it can be picked up by a simple ECG. Had Adam been tested his death could have been prevented. </p>\n<p>\nIn July 2010 I had a mini defibrillator fitted. </p>\n<p>\nIt is terrible to think Adam's death has probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\nThat's why I believe everyone should undergo a routine heart trace at 14. If an irregular heartbeat is detected, doctors can investigate further. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nNick Dias </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ASSISTANT site manager Nick collapsed in December and has now been fitted with a pacemaker. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The 27-year-old lives with fianc&#233;e Lynsey, 25, and their children, Brooke, five, and Riley, seven months, in Radlett, Herts. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a non-smoker, who is slim and exercises regularly, I never imagined I would have a heart problem. </p>\n<p>\nBut in December last year Lynsey and I were walking Brooke to school and after bending down to get her schoolbag from Riley's pushchair I passed out. </p>\n<p>\nSeconds later I came round to find Lynsey looking very concerned. Apparently I'd fallen backwards and cracked my head on the pavement. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe assumed I'd fainted and carried on walking Brooke to school. But as we did so, Lynsey became more worried because I started talking gibberish  I kept repeating myself and asking strange questions. </p>\n<p>\nAfter dropping Brooke off, Lynsey insisted on driving me to A&amp;E at Watford General Hospital. She was worried I might have concussion. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctor said because I'd passed out, he wanted to check my heart. And I was horrified when the ECG detected a problem with the rhythm of my heart. </p>\n<p>\nTerrifyingly, the doctor said I was suffering from heart block where the electrical impulses that make the heart beat don't always reach the heart. </p>\n<p>\nI was lucky my heart had started beating again  but next time I might not be so lucky and if I wasn't treated, could have a full-blown cardiac arrest. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors have been unable to find a reason for my heart block. As they have also found a slight problem with a heart valve, it is possibly something I was born with. </p>\n<p>\nSince then I've had a pacemaker fitted. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors say when the children are ten they will have to be tested too. </p>\n<p>\nBut it's something I feel should be routinely tested for in everyone. If it weren't for Lynsey insisting I go to A&amp;E that day, I might not have discovered this. </p>\n<p>\nAnd ultimately I could have suddenly suffered a potentially fatal cardiac arrest at any time. </p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By LYNSEY HAYWOOD","teaser":"AS Bolton's Fabrice Muamba recovers from heart attack, we show you how to save a life","headline":"What would YOU do?","section":"woman","id":4210291,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210291/What-would-YOU-do-if-someone-collapsed-in-front-of-you.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H2G-_1475241a.jpg","subdeck":"Cardiac arrest ...

Aspirin works by suppressing the creation of prostaglandin, a hormone that carries information about pain to the brain. It was first sold as 1899 as a powder by the German firm Bayer. </p>\n<p>\nAspirin can clearly do more than banish headaches, though some experts believe it could do more harm than good. </p>\n<p>\nHere, we look at some of the surprising uses. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDepression </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSOME experts believe depression and inflammation could be linked after small studies found some depressed people have high levels of cytokines  naturally occurring chemicals with inflammatory properties  in the body. </p>\n<p>\nSo because it's an anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin might be able to help. </p>\n<p>\nOne study followed 386 women for ten years  22 developed depression after the age of 50. </p>\n<p>\nOf these only one had taken aspirin. </p>\n<p>\nBut among those who did not develop depression, almost a third were taking it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAcne </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA KEY ingredient in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is used in many of today's off-the-shelf acne products. </p>\n<p>\nMix a tablet with water then rub the solution on to your skin. </p>\n<p>\nLeave it on for two minutes, then rinse off. </p>\n<p>\nThis will dry your pimples out and your spots will go faster. </p>\n<p>\nIf you have normal or dry skin don't try this more than once a week as you will lose too much moisture from your skin. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nDandruff </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA COMMON cause of this is a tiny yeast called Pityroporum ovale, which lives on the scalp. Aspirin is a mild anti-fungal so it can help. </p>\n<p>\nCrush two tablets and mix them with one serving of shampoo. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture to your hair and leave for about two minutes so it can settle on your scalp. </p>\n<p>\nRinse it off and shampoo your hair again. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDementia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSTUDIES have found that Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is an inflammatory condition of the brain so aspirin might be effective in treating it. </p>\n<p>\nResearch carried out in Utah, involving the observation and testing of more than 3,000 people, suggested taking it could reduce the risk of contracting the condition by 23 per cent. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nHeart disease </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIT IS thought it can help by reducing inflammation in the arteries that supply the heart  making the blood less likely to become sticky and form a deadly clot. </p>\n<p>\nIn some studies, taking aspirin reduced the likelihood of a cardiovascular problem, including heart disease, heart attack or stroke, by as much as 44 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nExperts also found it can help someone who has already had a heart attack or a stroke by reducing the risk of having another by a third. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAthlete's Foot </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nATHLETE'S foot and other fungal infections can be treated using a few aspirin pills and talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nGrind three pills until they are in a powder form. </p>\n<p>\nThen mix the powdered aspirin with some talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture on to the infected area of skin. </p>\n<p>\nDo this process twice a day to kill the fungi and to treat the irritation. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nIn-growing hair </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHAVE you got a painful in-growing hair that won't budge? </p>\n<p>\nAspirin is made up of acetylsalicylic acid, which exfoliates skin and has anti-inflammatory properties. </p>\n<p>\nSo applying a thick paste made of crushed aspirin and a little warm water could help you remove it with ease. </p>\n<p>\nApply it to the hair and leave to settle for ten to 15 minutes. Then remove using warm water. </p>\n<p>\nThis should get rid of the hair, or at least make it easier to remove. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nPre-eclampsia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA DAILY dose of aspirin during pregnancy could cut the risk of pre-eclampsia, a condition that threatens the lives of both mother and baby. </p>\n<p>\nA study of 32,000 women published in The Lancet medical journal found that mums who took it were ten per cent less likely to develop the condition. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nInsect bites </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAS these are marked by redness, itchiness and sometimes a burning sensation, aspirin  an anti-inflammatory  can help clear these up. </p>\n<p>\nWet the affected area and rub a small aspirin over the skin to help relieve the pain caused by mosquito bites or stings from a bee, wasp or hornet. </p>\n<p>\nTaking it orally could also help to reduce any painful swelling. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nShingles </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nASPIRIN is thought to be one of the most effective treatments for dealing with the pain and uncomfortable symptoms associated with shingles. </p>\n<p>\nMash two tablets into a paste and use a clean cotton swab to apply it to the skin. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nThe risks... </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<li></li> ONE in five asthmatics are at risk of a severe reaction to aspirin, according to research in Australia and the UK. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A recent London University study linked taking aspirin with a 30 per cent rise in the risk of debilitating  and potentially fatal  internal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A study last January advised doctors to stop prescribing aspirin to ward off heart attacks as it raises the risk of bleeding in the stomach by a third. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Oxford researchers say a daily dose as small as 75mg could increase the risk of abdominal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Anyone with an allergy to aspirin or a bleeding or clotting disorder should not use it for any purpose. </p>\n<p>\n<b>If in doubt, consult your GP.</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 01:04:00 +0000","teaser":"MANY illnesses and now even CANCER could apparently be prevented by taking aspirin","headline":"Aspirin's not just for headaches","section":"woman","id":4210700,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210700/The-drug-that-can-treat-depression-dementia-cancer-and-in-growing-hairs.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22ASP---_1475246a.jpg","subdeck":"Painless ... aspirin has been hailed as a treatment for depression, dementia and even cancer","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":true},{"isTop":0,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"'Cameron fills my life with love and joy' ...

Having Cameron has been the making of me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lad is also a brilliant big brother to Luke, ten, Jake, four, Mackenzie, two, and four-month-old Brooklyn. </p>\n<p>\nAs the Down's Syndrome Association runs its awareness campaign this week, courageous Crystal, 27, revealed how Cameron has made her a better person. </p>\n<p>\nAround one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down's and there are 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough the chance of a baby having Down's is higher for older mothers, more babies with Down's are born to younger women  because they have more children. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal fell pregnant at 15 and as the likelihood of having a Down's baby was considered so rare for a mum-to-be of her age, doctors had not even asked if she wanted to be tested. </p>\n<p>\nLike many women, Crystal assumed only older mums had Down's children. She admits when she was first told of her son's diagnosis at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire, she was horrified and ashamed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was still getting my head round the fact he had Down's when three hours after his birth he was whisked off for a scan. </p>\n<p>\n\"When they brought my baby back and told me he had three holes in his heart and would need a major op to fix it, I just fell apart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe devastated teenager sobbed in her mother's arms. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home in Wetherby, West Yorks, sharing a room with her sister and her new tot made life even harder. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I couldn't bear to go out, not because I didn't want to show him off but I was so scared he would die. </p>\n<p>\n\"He seemed so vulnerable and I was way out of my depth. I sobbed myself to sleep every night and kept thinking 'why me?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCameron's dad, 16-year-old Drew, stood by her  visiting the pair regularly. But Crystal was convinced he would leave her. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"All his mates were out clubbing and he was a 16-year-old lad with a baby with Down's.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt three months old Cameron went in for the op to fix the holes in his heart. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal was warned he would be in hospital for up to three months but after just three weeks he was doing so well he was discharged. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home, while most girls her age were out having fun, 16-year-old Crystal was caring for a very sick baby. Then something amazing happened. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Cameron just fought and fought and suddenly I realised it was time to stop feeling sorry for myself. I gave myself a massive boot up the backside. </p>\n<p>\n\"OK, my son wasn't the perfect baby but he was my son and he deserved a mum who would fight for him all the way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDrew and Crystal moved in together and the teen parents learnt Makaton, a language programme using signs and symbols, so they could communicate with Cameron as he grew up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Being able to sign was a major bonus. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Cameron and I formed a remarkable bond and suddenly I realised his disability was anything but.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Crystal fell pregnant with another child when Cameron was just 18 months old, a few friends said she wouldn't be able to cope. </p>\n<p>\nShe was offered a nuchal scan to determine the likelihood of Down's, but turned it down. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I didn't want to know. I coped with Cameron and I knew I'd cope again.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBaby Luke was born healthy, as was Jake two years after. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"The specialists don't know why I had a baby with Down's so young and then it never occurred again. They say it's extremely rare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Cameron was seven, Crystal split from his dad, suddenly finding herself a single mum to three boys. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I'm not saying it was easy but dealing with Cameron gave me the strength to deal with anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Some people close to me thought I would have a breakdown but it was actually Cameron that kept me going. </p>\n<p>\n\"He developed this really cheeky, funny personality. He had me in stitches and when I was down he seemed to sense it and would give me a cuddle. He's just so happy I couldn't be sad around him.\" </p>\n<p>\nCrystal has since found love with 21-year-old shop worker Darren Hooper. The couple have two sons. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Life's good. Cameron goes to a special needs school which he loves and has really boosted his speech and learning. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll admit that when I first heard my little boy had Down's I reached the depths of despair but now I don't see him as a boy with problems. </p>\n<p>\n\"I see him for what he is  an unbelievably loving little boy who loves cuddles and has tons of affection and love to give. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I know people thought I didn't have the maturity to cope but having Cameron has been the making of me.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Crystal has high hopes for Cameron's future: \"I would love him to move out of home, get a job, marry and go on to have his own family one day and there's no reason why he can't achieve any of those dreams. </p>\n<p>\n\"Cameron has ambitions like any boys his age. He loves playing sports and listening to Lady GaGa. </p>\n<p>\n\"He tells me he wants to be a footballer one day and I tell him he should aim high and go for it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Every child, no matter if they have Down's syndrome, should be given a chance to prove what they can do and lead as ordinary a life as possible.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSarah offers other parents hope </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nDOWN'S syndrome actress Sarah Gordy is proof that people with disabilities can lead a full and rewarding life. </p>\n<p>\nThe 34-year-old  who plays Lady Pamela on BBC drama Upstairs Downstairs  has starred in many TV shows and plays. And her mum Jane, 63, could not be more proud of her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jane, speaking about discovering her first-born had Down's syndrome, admitted: \"Being completely honest, if I was given a test and told my baby had Down's I would have considered a termination. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'd have been terrified about not being able to look after her. But that saddens me now. </p>\n<p>\n\"When I fell pregnant I wasn't ready to be a mum. In my 20s at the time, I'd never changed a nappy so I felt very unprepared. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Sarah was born I couldn't believe how beautiful she was.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane didn't have any tests for Down's syndrome because she was under 28 when she fell pregnant. But the paediatrician noticed Sarah had the condition from the moment he saw her. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"Calling my husband Jerry aside, he told him that Sarah had the condition. Not only that, but he asked him not to tell me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He said it was important for me to form a bond with Sarah first. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking back I don't know how poor Jerry kept it to himself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt wasn't until four days later that Jane found out. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was heartbroken and terrified I would lose my baby. He kept telling me about potential heart problems and operations she'd need. </p>\n<p>\n\"But finding out turned me from a girl into a fully-fledged mother.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily, Sarah didn't need any operations. Jane said: \"I wish I knew back then what I know now, about how much of an amazing life she'd have.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane had another daughter, Catherine, now 32, 16 months after Sarah and admits she felt relief when tests showed she did not have Down's. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"I just didn't know if having two children with the condition would be too much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wish parents-to-be were provided with more information about Down's syndrome before they make a decision about termination. </p>\n<p>\n\"No one should ever feel pressured either way, but it's such a difficult decision to make without knowing exactly what it will entail.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile everything took longer with Sarah, Jane says she soon realised her daughter had an incredible ability to feel what other people feel. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"If I'm ever stressed or worried and I tell Sarah I'm fine she will say, 'No you're not,' and I have to come clean. We're very close as no emotion goes unnoticed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Jane explains that Down's syndrome actors work very differently to those without the condition. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The interesting thing about Sarah is she doesn't really act. She feels very emotional on set. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't fake emotion, so instead she believes everything about her character. </p>\n<p>\n\"Once she was acting as an abused wife and I saw how much the abusive words were hurting her. </p>\n<p>\n\"When she came off set I said, 'Sarah  you're a beautiful, successful actress' and she slowly remembered that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to think that Sarah being successful on TV gives parents who are expecting a Down's syndrome child strength and confidence that their child can lead a really healthy life.\"\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL BOYS, Chief Executive at Down's Syndrome Association</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWE have seen great improvements in the lives of people with Down's syndrome since the association's formation in 1970. </p>\n<p>\nToday, the average life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome is 60 to 65 years, compared to 35 to 40 back in 1970.

Sick of her unhealthy lifestyle and size 18 waist, Linda decided to ditch booze for good. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I was stuck in a destructive routine of drinking and eating too much. </p>\n<p>\nI'd just broken up with my boyfriend and wanted to move on. I'd read about the LighterLife diet and wanted to give it a go. </p>\n<p>\nOvernight I gave up alcohol and started eating four food packs a day, containing 5-600 calories. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a complete shock to the system and the first week was really hard, but I knew it would be worth it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI used to drink a bottle of wine most nights, on Fridays I'd have work drinks and Saturdays I'd be out drinking with non-work friends. </p>\n<p>\nSundays were spent recovering. It was relentless. Drinking with clients and colleagues was part of my life and I'd got myself into really bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only after I gave it up I noticed what a big impact it had. </p>\n<p>\nNow after a work night out I'll come into the office whistling and full of energy, while my colleagues are often a step behind me. And I remember all the office gossip! </p>\n<p>\nIt's been five months now and I feel stronger, more confident and I have more energy than ever before. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from 14st 9lb to 12st, from a size 18-16 to a size 14-12  and I know I look as good as I feel. </p>\n<h1>\nLaura Coventry, 33 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDDING photographer Laura, from Glasgow, went teetotal two years ago after bingeing on boozy nights out left her with huge memory blanks. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most girls in their twenties and thirties I lived for the weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThe prospect of partying and heavy drinking got me through the working week and I'd wish away Monday to Friday. </p>\n<p>\nI drank a lot, not just a couple of glasses of wine, but enough to get seriously drunk. I just loved the euphoria and the buzz that it gave me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd suffer terrible hangovers, I'd regularly be in bed until 5pm with headaches and feeling sick, but I saw it as a price worth paying to let my inhibitions go. </p>\n<p>\nOn occasions I'd been out with friends, woken up with a shocking hangover  and realised there were huge blanks in my night out I couldn't remember. </p>\n<p>\nIt really scared me and for the first time I questioned why I was doing this to myself. I knew I had to change. </p>\n<p>\nThe first two weeks were the hardest, but I managed the first three-month goal I set myself, then extended that to six months. </p>\n<p>\nNow not one drop of booze has passed my lips since February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nSome friends want me to start going out drinking with them again and say that I've proven my point, but I'm determined not to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI have a fantastic new boyfriend now and I wake up on Mondays smiling, something which never happened before. </p>\n<p>\nI still party but I don't need alcohol to get a buzz. Life feels so much fuller and better. </p>\n<h1>\nLucy Troughton, 31 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>IT was last October when Lucy went teetotal after realising the damaging effect alcohol was having on her mood. The waitress, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI lived in London between the ages of 19 to 22 and I was out drinking socially most nights. But when I fell pregnant at 23 I didn't drink for the best part of a year. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not that I missed it but I still felt very young to be stuck at home, not out partying like I used to. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a band so drinking was almost expected of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of my friends didn't have kids so there was always someone around to go out drinking with. I soon reverted back to weekend drinking. </p>\n<p>\nI got stuck in a rut of Mondays being a write-off, like I was waiting for the day to finish the moment I woke up. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to be on form for my daughter Grace, now seven, but I was tired and only realised when it was too late that I was becoming depressed. </p>\n<p>\nIn mid-October last year I decided enough was enough and gave up alcohol completely. </p>\n<p>\nIt was, and still is, very hard. I didn't go out and became a bit of a recluse, focusing more on my music, gardening and reading. </p>\n<p>\nIt's had a huge effect and I really love the mornings now. </p>\n<p>\nI feel so clear-headed. And people often comment on how I'm 'glowing' now. </p>\n<p>\nThe idea of a glass of wine with a meal is still a temptation but it does get easier to say \"No\". </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal has taught me what I really value. And I'm happier than ever. </p>\n<h1>\nKatie Carr, 22 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BARMAID Katie from Bridlington, East Yorks, was a beer-swilling, pizza-scoffing ladette. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She went teetotal in July 2010 after binge drinking caused her to have a seizure and a new love interest persuaded her to transform her life. Katie says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTequila, sambuca, J&#228;gerbombs  I wasn't fussy. I could get through 20 pints of lager in a night. </p>\n<p>\nIn June 2010, I'd been fired from my job as a waitress for consistently turning up to work reeking of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree weeks later, I'd spent &#163;1,200 in my local pub. I put on nine stone in a year on a diet of booze and pizza, weighed 18.5st and was a size 22. I didn't wear make-up or dress girly. </p>\n<p>\nOne night in July, I was out with friends when I had a seizure in a nightclub. </p>\n<p>\nI was carried out by a bouncer and taken to hospital by ambulance. The doctor instructed me to stop drinking for six weeks while they ran tests. </p>\n<p>\nWhile I was sober, I had time to re-evaluate who I was. </p>\n<p>\nWanting to seize the day, I contacted the bouncer and asked him, \"When are you going to take me out?\". I was amazed when he said later that week. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the CT scans came back clear  I'd just drunk too much. I've not been back on the booze since and have now lost eight stone. </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal is one of the best things I've ever done. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from ladette to lady. </p>\n<h1>\nRebecca Spencer, 35 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE charity worker from Southend, Essex, went teetotal seven years ago after a charity trip shocked her into a lifestyle change.

Forget heavy tans, thick layers of foundation and cakey bronzer  radiance is now the key word in the beauty world. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Catwalk models have all been given little else but radiant, glowing skin, while celebrities such as Natalie Portman are setting the precedent for softer, fresher looks. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>If YOU fancy brightening your complexion, a few simple tricks can lift your skin. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>LAUREN NAYLOR shares her skin secrets so you can get up and glow. </b>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSkin perfection </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nLET'S face it, we'd all love to feel confident make-up free and be blessed with a radiant, glowy complexion. </p>\n<p>\nBut daily exposure to harsh elements can make it difficult to pull off. Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

It appears to have a pretty instant effect that lasts for about 30 minutes per cigarette. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The stronger the nicotine content, the greater this metabolism-boosting effect. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Smoking also seems to help to suppress the appetite. It does this in part by helping to block the action of chemicals in the brain that stimulate hunger. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But it is important to put things into perspective and to appreciate that, although some people do put on a lot of weight after quitting cigarettes, the average gain is between three and ten pounds. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The good news is that some experts report that using nicotine patches helps to lower appetite, and that those who use them while trying to quit gain less weight than those who do not. Having regular 'doses' of carbohydrate may also help to beat the hunger pangs which may be triggered by quitting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"And on the day you decide to give up, make sure you have breakfast and keep up this habit. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Not having anything to eat first thing can be a real problem because, by mid-morning, your body will not only be craving its usual nicotine fix but will also have low blood sugar. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is important when giving up smoking to remember that, even though cigarettes appear to help a bit in the battle of the bulge, there are plenty of slim people who do not smoke and plenty of overweight people who do smoke. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Continuing to smoke because you think giving up will make you fat is no excuse not to try quitting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Doing so could well save your life.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<b>5 point weight proof plan</b>\n</h2>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1. </b>Don't give up when you are tired. Being tired always makes you more hungry. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>2. </b>Throw out fattening foods that might tempt you. If you can't do this, put them in a cupboard away from day-to-day foods so you are not constantly seeing them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>3.</b> Stock up on healthy snacks such as satsumas, grapes, low-fat yogurts, small 30g servings of nuts like almonds, cashews and peanuts and some miniature dark-chocolate Green &amp; Black's bars that you can nibble on when the nicotine withdrawal triggers hunger pangs. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.</b> Drink at least six to eight cups or mugs of fluids each day to help keep hydrated. Being dehydrated can make you stressed and grumpy. It is not a good idea to try to quit caffeine-containing drinks at the same time as giving up cigarettes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>5.</b> Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a small snack in between to ensure that levels of sugar in your blood are steady and stable. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEggs on toast, cereal or fruit salad and yogurt make good breakfasts. </p>\n<p>\nTuna, chicken or hummus-stuffed pitta or wraps are examples of energy-extending lunches and spaghetti Bolognese, baked potato with baked-bean toppings, stir fries and omelettes make good dinners. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>How exercise can help</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>NICKI SAYS: </b>\"A new study has discovered that vigorous exercise can have a positive impact on the success rate of women trying to give up smoking. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"This is exciting news, especially when combined with previous research that shows exercising for one to two hours a week while quitting also significantly reduces the amount of weight gained. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"By incorporating exercise into your quitting programme, the feelgood endorphins your body produces also help you to overcome the mood swings that come with quitting.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nTips to give up smoking </h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b><br></br>Commit to daily exercise sessions during the first month of quitting. </b>Preferably in the morning to perk your mood up for the day ahead. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSign up to classes, if you can, to keep you on track and schedule in things like swimming and cycling.

I don't remember her ever saying, \"Wouldn't you be pretty if you did this or that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe never focused on anything beyond wanting me to be presentable  just well-groomed.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe wanted me to take care of myself and be healthy. </p>\n<p>\nShe did ask one or two questions when I became a cheerleader at high school because I would be teasing my hair and wearing lipstick and eyeliner. </p>\n<p>\nI have an affiliation with a lot of countries. My mum was from Norway, my dad from Switzerland and my grandmother was Finnish, I have an Italian uncle, my first love was from South Africa and I was born in Texas.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am definitely a Texan girl. It is a culture you really love in a Latin sort of way. You taste it and hear it and the climate is hot  Texas hot.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI felt lucky that my parents were European  different  and opened the doors to let me see America is not the centre of the universe. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant that, with Bridget Jones, I could go to London and enjoy all things English that make the country so wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the making of the first film, I was even whistling songs by the Spice Girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my mum was a realist about bringing up a teenage girl in America and kept a sense of humour. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me that there are consequences for the things you say and do. She wanted me to grow up to be a good person. She and Dad liked simple and quiet. We had a very quiet house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mum didn't talk about her childhood growing up in Norway during the Second World War. Her sisters talked but all had difficulty in putting into words what they had seen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey told about women giving birth in tunnels because there was no safe haven in any other structure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd about being lost from family members and not being sure if they were alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it was different for me, from my friends, growing up in a house where your mother was grateful just to have peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was one thing which was never acceptable, though.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I said: \"I don't know how to do that\", she would say: \"Learn.\" </p>\n<p>\nShe encouraged me to get a college education (Renee has an English degree) as something to fall back on if acting didn't work out.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved to Los Angeles on December 6, 1993, to be exact.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy attitude was that I was going to see where it took me.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been working in Texas from the age of 21, and been in a couple of films. But I had pretty well exhausted my learning opportunities. </p>\n<p>\nSo I took a grungy little one-bed apartment and was scared to death of the future. It was a leap of faith, I guess. </p>\n<p>\nI had some friends in LA who I had met on films but inside and emotionally, I felt alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make a living, I worked in a bar called The Three Cubs on a street called Vine, behind the Mobil gas station.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was an incredible place for a girl like me, who had lived in relatively safe places all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were crack deals being done on the street corners  so I would come back from the bar late at night then not be able to get out of my car to my apartment until the deals were completed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked at the bar for two years. That was why Mum's guidance was so important and I stayed happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you can take care of yourself and see your friends, that is all that matters. </p>\n<p>\nThe main difference that the film Jerry Maguire made in my life was I could pay my rent and didn't have to waitress any more. It gave me freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew from the start that if I failed in acting, I always had my degree and could try a million things. I was not a \"look at me\" kind of girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had gravitated toward acting because I had a vivid imagination and daydreamed a lot. </p>\n<p>\nBut I did not daydream about being on a film set, winning an Oscar or having people know my name.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for the fact my mum never worried that I would compromise myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was always telling me, 'You don't sit down enough'  but she learned to trust my instincts.\n</p>","timestamp":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"ACTRESS Renee Zellweger reveals how her Norwegian mother influenced her career","headline":"Renee's European parents","section":"woman","id":4203467,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4203467/Renee-Zellweger-America-is-not-the-centre-of-the-universe.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01473/Renee_Zellweger--5_1473337a.jpg","subdeck":"Different perspective ...

To finish the look or fill in any gaps, simply apply a brow pencil in gentle, feathering strokes and remember, less is more. Finish off with a slick of clear brow gel or if you have none to hand, a smear of clear lip balm.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTry Simple Kind To Lips Intensive Lip Moisturiser for &#163;2.99 from supermarkets nationwide.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BROW TIDY: </b>There's no need to worry if you've overplucked  superbrow serums are available to help encourage growth.\n</p>\n<p>\nNew RapidBrow serum (&#163;37, Boots) claims to improve eyebrow density by up to 108 per cent in 60 days.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe High Street has also seen a huge surge in specialist brow bars such as Shavata (Harrods and House of Fraser nationwide) and Blink (Selfridges nationwide).\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir therapists are trained to get your brows back in order using various methods.

So step away from your dark brown pencil.

He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a child I spent a lot of time at boarding school, away from the prying eyes of my parents, so I didn't have anyone to stop me drinking gallons of lemonade and overdosing on sweets. </p>\n<p>\nEven though we weren't supposed to have access to all the things you know are bad for your teeth at school, all the mums used to smuggle in treats which we would hide in our tuck boxes, so it felt like a bit of rebellious fun. </p>\n<p>\nI've regularly drunk coffee from the age of nine, I smoked until about a year ago and I enjoy a glass of wine most evenings, and a few more at weekends, none of which can have helped. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you're young, you don't really appreciate that you only get one set of adult teeth and never imagine that once you've done the damage, it can't easily be undone. </p>\n<p>\nI also had an eight-year break from seeing a dentist from the age of 15 until about three months ago. </p>\n<p>\nBut it got to the point where I knew I had to get help  they weren't looking great and I was experiencing discomfort. </p>\n<p>\nBut three months ago, when I did finally bite the bullet and saw a dentist, she actually told me I wasn't anywhere near as bad as some other patients she had. </p>\n<p>\nIn the past few months I've had three fillings, upping my total to six, which isn't great for someone who's 24. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a musician I had to opt for white fillings as my appearance is very important  and I'm now seeing the real cost of all those sweets and other bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nAnd being a musician, my income stream is very erratic but once I hopefully have a steadier income I'm hoping to invest in some cosmetic dentistry. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I went for my consultation with Professor Eder, he pointed out that I showed strong evidence of tooth grinding and worn-down enamel, which he said could be linked to a stressful life. </p>\n<p>\nWith all the costs and discomfort of bad teeth, I'm now really focused on my dental health. </p>\n<p>\nI really do feel like I've turned a corner now and feel cautiously optimistic that I can at least stop the self-inflicted damage. </p>\n<p>\n<b>PROFESSOR EDER SAYS:</b> \"Edward fell from a skateboard as a child and caused some damage to his teeth. </p>\n<p>\n\"He has since experienced wear of his front teeth, and particularly his lower right canine, as a result of night grinding and clenching. </p>\n<p>\n\"Edward also had a high acidic intake from fizzy drinks as a teenager and also diluted fruit juices more recently, causing some loss of enamel on the biting surfaces of his back teeth, where some of the surface detail has been lost. </p>\n<p>\n\"With regard to managing this toothwear, Edward should limit acidic foods and drinks, use a daily fluoride mouthrinse and wear a very specific design of mouth guard over his upper teeth at night.\"\n</p>\n<h1>\nDee Hutchings, 36 </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h2>\nTooth age 46 </h2>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>DEE, a charity worker from Battersea, south west London, lives with partner Hannah, 34. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWHAT'S strange about my teeth is that I genuinely don't remember the tooth fairy visiting me on a regular basis as a child and certainly don't recall losing my teeth. </p>\n<p>\nMost people would assume this would mean my teeth would be completely shot as your milk teeth are supposed to be weaker, added to the extra seven or so years of use they'd have had, but I don't have one filling! </p>\n<p>\nI have the right number of teeth, so it doesn't feel or look that strange, although some at the front are small. </p>\n<p>\nI guess I'm lucky in that growing up I always knew what to do to look after my teeth  I hardly ever had sweets or sugary, fizzy drinks. </p>\n<p>\nAnd unlike other children who feel deprived as kids then abuse their teeth when they move away from home, I always knew why I wasn't allowed those tooth-rotting foods and drinks. </p>\n<p>\nTo this day I always water down acidic fruit juices. I brush two to three times a day and, like my whole family, know how important a generally healthy diet is. </p>\n<p>\nOf course I have the same vices most adults do  I enjoy a glass of wine and love my coffee, and if I'm feeling particularly low-energy I might have a can of cola but it's definitely not a habit. </p>\n<p>\nWhere I think I might have fallen down in the past is that I haven't seen a dentist for several years now because of moving around and travelling. </p>\n<p>\nI figured if I felt any pain or noticed any worrying changes, I'd book in to see one. </p>\n<p>\nBut having read all the stories about how hard it is to find a good NHS dentist, I was happy not to get something fixed until it broke. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I saw Professor Eder, I was reassured that I don't have any cavities, although he did point out I have some tartar around the base of my teeth, which should be removed by a dental hygienist to protect my gums and teeth in the longer term. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne really interesting thing he picked up on was my front teeth showing signs of wear. </p>\n<p>\nI confessed I suck a pen regularly at work  and I also push my tongue against my front teeth while I sleep. </p>\n<p>\nOverall, I'm very happy with Professor Eder's verdict but looking at the close-up photos of my teeth, it's obvious how easily you can fool yourself into believing your teeth are great when in fact we could all take better care. </p>\n<p>\n<b>PROFESSOR EDER says: </b>\"As a result of sporting injuries when younger and tooth wear from night grinding  and also abrasion from holding a pen between his front teeth more recently  Dee's teeth are significantly older than his actual age. </p>\n<p>\n\"He should avoid holding a pen between his front teeth and could have some relatively straightforward cosmetic treatment. </p>\n<p>\n\"He should also wear a very specific design of mouth guard over his upper teeth at night.\"\n</p>\n<h1>\nCaroline Brill, 56 </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h2>\nTooth age 71 </h2>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>CAROLINE is a retired teacher from Mill Hill in north west London. She's married to Alan, 64, with two sons, Simon, 30, and David, 27. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She spent a five-figure sum on restorative dentistry and says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAround 20 years ago I noticed my teeth disappearing  the front ones in particular had worn down to semi-circles and my gums would bleed whenever I bit into anything hard. </p>\n<p>\nMy dentist confirmed that my teeth were indeed disappearing and at Guy's Dental Hospital I was given the bad news that I'd need very costly restorative work to rebuild them. </p>\n<p>\nAs a teacher with two small children, I simply couldn't even contemplate the cost or the treatment time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMy dentist and the specialist I saw at Guy's suggested my problem could be that I wasn't producing enough saliva, which normally washes excess acid off the teeth. </p>\n<p>\nAround three years ago my regular dentist referred me to Professor Eder. </p>\n<p>\nOver the course of a year I saw him once or twice a week for three-hour sessions in which he completely rebuilt my teeth  first he replaced all of my many fillings. </p>\n<p>\nI had to sleep wearing a large dental \"splint\" to widen my jaw enough to accept the new, larger crowns. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI then needed crown-lengthening surgery to cut back the gums and expose more of each tooth to provide an anchor for the new crowns. Each tooth was filed down before the new crowns were fitted. </p>\n<p>\nThat all finished in March 2010 and I couldn't be happier with the results. </p>\n<p>\nI won't deny the whole process was very invasive and time-consuming  but I hardly suffered any pain. </p>\n<p>\nMy life has been transformed beyond measure  I can smile with confidence for the first time in years. </p>\n<p>\n<b>PROFESSOR EDER SAYS:</b> \"Caroline was referred by her dentist after years of problems with her teeth becoming increasingly short and restorations simply falling off her front teeth. </p>\n<p>\n\"Having been made aware of the erosion problems of acidic foods and drinks as well as attrition from grinding and clenching, Caroline opted for a comprehensive reconstruction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By PROFESSOR ANDREW EDER</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTOOTH wear is the latest challenge to oral health. More than 50 per cent of children and pretty well all adults show signs of tooth surface loss. </p>\n<p>\nFrom as young as we can remember, we are told to visit our dentist regularly and brush our teeth to stop them from becoming decayed and also to prevent gum problems. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a positive result of these ingrained habits and also through the addition of fluoride to toothpaste and drinking water, we are keeping our teeth for longer. </p>\n<p>\nHowever, wear and tear is instead becoming a really significant problem. </p>\n<p>\nTooth surface loss happens as a direct result of any of the following three causes. </p>\n<p>\nFirst, many of us subconsciously grind our teeth, normally at night, often by way of stress relief  wearing away the enamel surface. </p>\n<p>\nSecond, abrasive foods in a \"healthy\" diet and over-brushing can cause teeth to simply wear away. </p>\n<p>\nThird  and very much on the increase  is erosion of the outer tooth surfaces from acidic foods and drinks or even stomach acid regurgitation. </p>\n<p>\nIt is often hard to arrive at an absolute diagnosis and it is normally a combination of one or more of the above. </p>\n<p>\nThere are also many pressures seen in today's lifestyle. Prolonged periods of intentional vomiting are not only seen in the most unfortunate of anorexics and bulimics but also in those who simply wish to keep a trim figure for professional purposes such as acting or dancing. </p>\n<p>\nAn increasing problem is also seen in athletes, who regularly sip on sparkling sports drinks, and also regular swimmers, where the repeated contact with acidic chlorine-containing substances in the water can be a major problem. </p>\n<p>\nSuch sports-related issues will be more widely reported as we approach the Olympics. </p>\n<p>\nCritical to success is identification of the cause of the tooth wear at the outset. Otherwise, the more comprehensive treatment is likely to fail. </p>\n<p>\nFor example, patients who present with regular stomach acid regurgitation may require medical investigation and management, while those drinking lots of fruit juice and sparkling drinks may simply be advised to reduce or modify their intake. </p>\n<p>\nSocial drug abuse is also highlighted as a cause of tooth wear as prolonged periods of grinding and clenching go hand-in-hand with the craving. </p>\n<p>\nPatients may complain of sharp and sensitive teeth that can look shorter. Some may also report that chewing has become a bit of a problem. </p>\n<p>\nIt is the local dentist who plays a key role in the early diagnosis of such problems, together with dietary and social advice to help limit the problem from progressing irreversibly. </p>","timestamp":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"WITH dental care now a luxury for a quarter of Brits, an expert rates 3 volunteers' tooth age and offers tips to improve teeth","headline":"Are your teeth ageing too soon?","section":"woman","id":4147318,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4147318/Sun-health-Are-your-teeth-ageing-too-soon.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01457/061dd0ae-250_1457995a.jpg","subdeck":"Clampdown ...

At one point her husband walked by oblivious to what was happening. </p>\n<p>\nThen 31, she was punched repeatedly in the face as she tried to resist and was told if she looked at his face she would be killed. </p>\n<p>\nChillingly, she had heard her husband walk past during the assault close to their flat which left her with mental health problems until her death. </p>\n<p>\nErwin said in evidence: \"That really upset me because the shed was so close - two metres away. I could have stopped it happening but as he had his hand over her mouth restraining it, she couldn't call out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGerman-born Imiela, 57, was also found guilty of indecent assault and buggery over the attack which he committed knowing he faced jail over a string of armed robberies carried out after he lost his job as a plasterer. </p>\n<p>\nHe was sentenced shortly afterwards to 14 years in prison and released in 1996 when he found work on the railways. </p>\n<p>\nBut by 2004 he was back behind bars after raping seven women and children in a \"savage and perverted campaign against total strangers\" in 2001 and 2002. </p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Prostitutes</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nColleagues later recalled how he bragged about using prostitutes and boasted over a fling with a girl he said looked only 12. </p>\n<p>\nDays earlier he had driven to Birmingham and kidnapped a 10-year-old girl at knifepoint before putting her through a five-hour sex ordeal in his car. Suspicions grew his stories were really tales of his sex attacks. He also suggested the little girl might have \"deserved it\". </p>\n<p>\nHe got seven life sentences for attacking children as young as 10, 13 and 14 and women as old as 52. He often chose to attack near the M25 motorway which led to him being dubbed \"the M25 rapist\". </p>\n<p>\nAfter that trial he wrote to his son, confessing: \"I cannot control my sexual urges.
