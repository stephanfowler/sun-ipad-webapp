He's embarrassed her and he's got no right to put her in this position. </p>\n<p>\n\"He should literally find a hole and hide in it for the next week. It really, really annoys me. It's like, 'Who do you think you are?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStressing his support for N-Dubz singer Tulisa, Simon went on: \"It makes no difference with me about her coming back on the show  100 per cent. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I mean, God, if I said no (to her coming back) it's allowing every sleazebag in the country to wreck somebody's career when she didn't do something wrong. </p>\n<p>\n\"The public are very, very a) forgiving, and b) understanding. But I hope they don't forgive the person who did it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSimon said all four of last year's X Factor judges  Tulisa, Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Kelly Rowland  were set to return. The Sun has already revealed that Gary will be back. </p>\n<p>\nDespite Simon's backing, the leaked video scandal showed no signs of easing up last night. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe man Tulisa says appears in the video  Justin Edwards  has made a series of claims about the origin of the six-minute film. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun can reveal that he told the X Factor judge's lawyers last October that he didn't have a copy of it. </p>\n<p>\nTulisa, who is said to be \"completely devastated\" by the leak, set the law firm on Edwards  known as MC Ultra  after apparently learning about the online leaks. </p>\n<p>\nIn response, he stated that he had \"no knowledge whatsoever of any tape\" and didn't have \"a tape such as you referred to at all\". </p>\n<p>\nHe added in his response to the lawyers: \"Even if I did which I do not, I would have no desire to publish them, simply because I would find that ungentlemanly. I was brought up better than that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRapper Edwards made the denial just weeks after an unknown man showed The Sun images of a woman performing a sex act. He claimed the woman was Tulisa. </p>\n<p>\nYesterday, after Tulisa claimed in a YouTube video that HE had leaked the camera-phone footage</a>, Edwards said on Twitter: \"To find the truth both sides of the story should be heard.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTulisa had initially denied she was in the video. But after a website this week started charging for downloads, her lawyers raced to London's High Court to have it taken offline. </p>\n<p>\nAnd on Wednesday night Tulisa admitted she WAS the woman in the film. </p>\n<p>\nThe singer  poised to launch a solo career  said on YouTube: \"When you share an intimate moment with someone you love, you never imagine that at any point it will be shared with people around the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's a pretty tough time for me, but I don't feel I should take the heat for it.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nc.robertson@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By COLIN ROBERTSON, TV Editor, and GARY O&rsquo;SHEA","teaser":"MUSIC guru Simon Cowell stands by Tulisa Contostavlos over her sex tape scandal","headline":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job","section":"news","id":4212851,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNN2301TULI--53202_1476168a.jpg","subdeck":"X-rated video ... talent show judge Tulisa Contostavlos","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":true},{"isTop":1,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Tragic ...

It is believed the Bodyguard star suffered a heart attack before slipping under the water and drowning. </p>\n<p>\nRelatives were said to be devastated at hearing cocaine was to blame. </p>\n<p>\nWhitney's family said in a statement: \"We are saddened to learn of the toxicology results, although we are glad to now have closure.\" </p>\n<p>\nHer mum Cissy, 79, and daughter Bobbi Kristina, 19, have been struggling to cope since the tragedy. </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCoroner's spokesman Craig Harvey confirmed Whitney appeared to have used cocaine \"in the time period immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub\". </p>\n<p>\nA report from the coroner's office stated: \"How injury occurred: Found submerged in a bathtub filled with water; cocaine intake.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt said Whitney also had marijuana, Benadryl, Xanax and other medication in her system</a>, but those drugs were NOT a factor. </p>\n<p>\nInvestigators had said they found no evidence of illegal drugs at the scene, although officials confirmed prescription pill bottles were found. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAmerican showbiz site TMZ reported sources that claimed a mystery individual removed any traces of cocaine from Whitney's hotel room. </p>\n<p>\nThey also alleged that the person who cleaned up the drugs had supplied them to the singer. </p>\n<p>\nIt added that Beverly Hills Police have confirmed their investigation into Whitney's death had not yet been finished. </p>\n<p>\nBut the site said cops would not comment on whether they were looking at any allegations of evidence tampering </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe coroner's report said her death was an accident, and added: \"No trauma or foul play is suspected.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe coroner's office said results indicated Whitney also suffered from heart disease that caused 60 per cent narrowing of her arteries. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAssistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said the condition is common in cocaine users. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It just beats up their heart and they will have a heart attack.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA final, more detailed, coroner's report will be released in two weeks. </p>\n<p>\nWhitney battled addiction to crack cocaine at the height of her fame.

Two needed skin grafts for hand, arm and leg wounds. The powerful hound's other two victims were described as \"walking wounded\". Marksmen and cops with riot shields were called in  and Poison was killed with four shots. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt later emerged it was known to neighbours as a menace. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCouncil officials dealing with dangerous dogs were alerted last year after it tore chunks off a cyclist. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe house was visited but there was no response. No action was taken. Yesterday's drama erupted in Stratford, East London  in Albert Square, namesake of the setting of TV's EastEnders. Cops smashed the door with a ram to seize a man wanted for kidnap and GBH. But the dog went for them, sending them scattering. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNeighbour Dennis Clarke, 72, said: \"It had one around the back of his leg, right down to the bone. He was screaming and yelling for help.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSome cops raced along the street, telling locals to stay inside. Others tried to beat the dog with poles. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA man of 25, suspected to be the dog's owner, was arrested. He was also quizzed about the original alleged offences.

Girls assume she is a porn star. Then there's the back pain. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Lots of women want big boobs but it's actually a total nightmare. </p>\n<p>\n\"The only men I attract are the sleazy type. It's rare that a guy looks me in the face when talking to me. </p>\n<p>\n\"Guys will flat-out stare and try all the cheesy chat-up lines. And a lot of the time they want their picture taken with them. Not me  <i>them</i>.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"Sometimes it can be a bit scary. A few blokes will try to get really hands-on. When I'm out with my male friends they'll usually circle round me. They're my bodyguards.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't fare much better with other girls. She says: \"Women assume my boobs are fake  they look at me like I'm a porn star. It's older women who always comment on them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They'll tut and shake their heads as they walk past me in the street. I can hear them saying, 'They're so fake', and, 'Look at her flaunting them'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I try to smile through it. I know they're real but sometimes it can be hurtful. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've developed a way of walking so my boobs bounce up and down and people can see they're real. It looks like I'm walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\n\"Women can get quite jealous  that's probably why I have more male friends.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut meeting the right guy is difficult. Glasgow girl Stephanie says: \"I broke up with my ex in 2010. He couldn't handle all the attention I get and became insanely jealous. </p>\n<p>\n\"When we were out he'd get mad when other guys checked me out. I tried telling him it couldn't be helped  he knew what he was getting into.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie has seen a few men since the split but no one special has caught her eye. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They become too obsessed with my boobs, it's all they think about. It's hard to find a guy to see past them. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of blokes are just after me for the status of it, they see it as just another notch on the bedpost. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I want my boyfriend to see me for me, I'm more than just a pair of boobs. I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half  but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs  though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that  it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By AMY JONES","teaser":"STEPHANIE'S back-breaking, all-natural boobs are subject of daily abuse from strangers","headline":"My natural 32K boobs are a nightmare...only sleazy blokes chat me up while girls tut and assume I'm a porn star","section":"news","id":4212810,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212810/My-natural-32K-boobs-are-a-nightmare.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2330a---532_1476242a.jpg","subdeck":"'I have a walk to make them bounce to show they're real' ...

If it's desperation bringing the best midfielder in Britain back for the last 20 years then I think we can accept that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think Vieira was programmed for that. Roberto had a wee dig a couple of weeks back. We're all going to play our hand that way.

What is that? Could that come under the description of desperation?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFerguson also rejected Vieira's assertion that a further sign of United struggling was their inability to keep hold of Ravel Morrison during the January transfer window and their on-going battle to retain Paul Pogba. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFergie added: \"The point he made about Ravel Morrison and losing our young players  we wanted to sell him let's be clear about that, for obvious reasons. </p>\n<p>\n\"But we want Pogba to stay because we think he's going to be a fantastic Manchester United player and hopefully that's the case.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFerguson confirmed he expects to have a strong squad available to face Fulham on Monday. </p>\n<p>\nChris Smalling, Phil Jones, Fabio, Tom Cleverley and Paul Pogba all came through a reserve-team outing against Aston Villa last night. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the Scot said: \"Phil Jones and Chris Smalling have been in and out in particular in terms of illness and injuries over the last couple of months. </p>\n<p>\n\"Tom Cleverley, Paul Pogba and Fabio all had a game.

Of course they can. </p>\n<p>\n\"I always tell people there's a guy out there who can beat them  and they quickly cotton on that it's me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It's funny, boxing passes through different eras and it's through no fault of their own that there happens to be no real competition out there for them. </p>\n<p>\n\"But boxing is a sport where it's all about being king of the hill, where people want to see one champion. </p>\n<p>\n\"We've got two champions right now, two brothers who won't fight each other, and that kind of devalues the whole heavyweight scene. That's what we're stuck with. </p>\n<p>\n\"There's definitely too many titles out there. When somebody says they're the champion, you can't help asking the champion of what? </p>\n<p>\n\"Unless you've got two belts, you're not a champion to me. The WBC is still the major title out there, it's the most prestigious.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLewis believes the last opponent he ever faced is showing some serious signs of slowing up now that he is 40. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I was saying a while ago that Vitali's looking pretty heavy on his feet and is really relying on his size right now. </p>\n<p>\n\"Father Time is definitely knocking on his door.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for Haye, Lewis claims the Londoner still has a chance of securing the fight he craves. </p>\n<p>\nBut he openly admits that Vitali could need Haye more than Haye needs Vitali. </p>\n<p>\nThe 46-year-old added: \"When you look at the grand scheme of things, who else is out there? </p>\n<p>\n\"David wants to redeem himself against the bigger Klitschko, who I believe is the more awkward and difficult one, but maybe he can do better against the guy who doesn't move too well. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was surprised that David didn't get a better result against Wladimir, but like he said, he did hurt his toe. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's hard to move properly when you hurt your toe but, if it was me, I wouldn't have taken the fight because you have to be in perfect nick when you challenge the best. </p>\n<p>\n\"You have to be perfect on that day you step into the ring. </p>\n<p>\n\"All through training camp you could have injuries or the flu, but that date for the fight is still there, it's cemented and you have to do everything you can to survive until that day. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it comes to colds, belly aches, hurt toes, you have to make sure you don't have any of those.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite their close friendship, Lewis is adamant he would never have followed Haye's lead of indulging in pre-fght trash talking. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I realised that people can do all the talking they want, but it really comes down to what you do in the ring. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Mike Tyson fought me in 2002, he had all these tough guys around him  including a guy called Crocodile. </p>\n<p>\n\"But it didn't bother me because I knew he couldn't bring them in the ring with him, it was just me and him. </p>\n<p>\n\"To shut them up, all I had to do was beat Tyson  and I did just that. </p>\n<p>\n\"All I ever had to say to people was, 'OK, say what you like but we'll see what happens in the ring'. I'm like the silent assassin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately for fight fans, the 'silent assassin' is enjoying life at home watching his four children grow up. </p>\n<p>\nBut the urge of smashing the stranglehold the Klitschko brothers have on heavyweight boxing will never go away. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lennox Lewis is appearing in Virgin Media's idents for Britain's Got Talent, from this Saturday on ITV1.

Quality-wise certainly, and we will take a gamble if we find top, top quality of course. </p>\n<p>\n\"The number of the squad is 25.

We need other guys to score as well. </p>\n<p>\n\"We need to score from set pieces, we've not done that very well this season. </p>\n<p>\n\"We need goals from the wide men, we need goals from midfield. </p>\n<p>\n\"Stan (Stiliyan Petrov) has scored five, Charles N'Zogbia has got a couple, Gabby six or seven. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are looking for Gabby to get amongst the goals  but he is also a provider and his assists this season been excellent as well.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMcLeish believes Agbonlahor could stake a late claim to be part of England's Euro 2012 plans if he performs well in the finale to the season. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"You just want all of your players to play to their highest level in every single game and, if they do that, it is up to the powers in the England set-up to decide if they are good enough. </p>\n<p>\n\"But, if they keep doing it for their clubs, they've got a chance to take the next step.

It is something that has blighted the players a bit at this club over the last two seasons. </p>\n<p>\n\"These are things we've got to keep working on. It is disappointed we haven't halted the slide when you work at something. </p>\n<p>\n\"You are on the touchline looking to trust the players and then one man loses a bit of concentration and it can happen.

It's well laid groundwork.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The fact that he has had this seed planted in his mind for several months, I'm expecting it to be quite spectacular.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He is someone who has a full grasp on the industry and is putting out when he feels is the best build and the best product. Not 'what can I best do for me'. </p>\n<p>\n\"He really is a consummate pro and really knows the ins and outs of what makes a great match. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's really, really spectacular and I expect this to be really standout.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBusy with his training school and content not to undertake the gruelling travel schedule top wrestlers have to endure, Storm is happy to only occasionally strap on his wrestling boots.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn Wrestlemania weekend, though, in Florida, he will be making a rare wrestling appearance in taking on Mike Bennett for top Indy promotion Ring of Honor.\n</p>\n<p>\nBennett is the real-life boyfriend of stunning former WWE diva Maria Kanellis, who also accompanies her man for his matches in ROH.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe match will take place at ROH's Showdown in the Sun iPPV, and Lance says that he is only accepting the bout because he rates Bennett highly.\n</p>\n<p>\nStorm said: \"I'm very choosy about who I work with now. Since I wrapped up the full-time career I only work with people I'm interested in working with. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's got a ton of talent. I think he stands out a little more in Ring of Honor in that he tends to work his own style and be a bit different than the other Ring of Honor guys.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Having Maria there is an interesting twist too, in that I was the first person who started training her when she got hired by WWE. It should be a lot of fun.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not coming back to have a match that just blends into the card and doesn't stand out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I plan on really putting in a huge effort and having a standout performance on that show despite how great the rest of the card is going to be.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter calling time on his full-time in-ring career in 2004, Storm worked for OVW  WWE's former developmental territory in Ohio  where he helped to train several wrestlers who now adorn our screens on a weekly basis.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the standouts of the group Storm tutored in OVW was Dolph Ziggler, who many have compared to legends such as Shawn Michaels and Curt Hennig and have tipped for the top in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\nStorm agrees that Ziggler could be a major star someday, but warns he must be careful not to damage himself along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"Dolph was a quick learner right out of the gate. I pretty much had him from scratch. </p>\n<p>\n\"I worked with him for almost a year in OVW and it wasn't too long after that he made his debut with the Spirit Squad.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You can just imagine how nervous he must have been with only about a year of training behind him and not a whole lot of experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He was in the ring with Triple H and Shawn Michaels doing a feud with DX.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I keep having to remind him to be careful, because when you are throwing around names like Shawn Michaels and Curt Hennig, you also have to remember that both of them had very bad backs that hampered their career.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I keep reminding him that while it's great to take amazing bumps, you don't have to do so on every single move.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information about ROH Showdown in the Sun, including Storm v Bennett, go to https://www.rohwrestling.com/</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nTo listen to the full 50-minute interview, check out Rob McNichol's One Sided Ring podcast.</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 11:41:20 +0000","byline":"By ROB McNICHOL","teaser":"LANCE STORM predicts big things from Chris Jericho and CM Punk at Mania","headline":"Storm: Wrestlemania title bout will be 'spectacular'","section":"sport","id":4213809,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/4213809/Lance-Storm-Wrestlemania-title-bout-will-be-spectacular.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/lancestorm_22_532x_1476374a.jpg","subdeck":"LEGEND ...

Despite not being able to bowl, he is likely to keep his place at No 6 after hitting 66 in the four-wicket win over a Sri Lankan Development XI. </p>\n<p>\nEngland could leave out Bopara and play another bowler in the First Test on Monday  but Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower have never adopted that strategy. </p>\n<p>\nKeeper Matt Prior, who scored 84 from 60 balls yesterday, said: \"With the heat out here, that role of bowling a few is vital. It means the main bowlers can have a bit of a break. </p>\n<p>\n\"If we do decide to go with five bowlers and I'm asked to bat one place higher than normal at No 6, I'll be happy to grab that chance.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBell was out for 11 and he now has 136 runs in 15 innings since the end of last summer. But fifties by Bopara, Pietersen, Prior and Samit Patel hustled England over the line after they were set 359 in 64 overs. </p>\n<p>\nPrior added: \"Bell is hitting it fantastically in the nets, so I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out and smashes a hundred in the first Test. </p>\n<p>\n\"We see batsmen struggling time and time again.

He's embarrassed her and he's got no right to put her in this position. </p>\n<p>\n\"He should literally find a hole and hide in it for the next week. It really, really annoys me.

But I hope they don't forgive the person who did it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSimon said all four of last year's X Factor judges  Tulisa, Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Kelly Rowland  were set to return. The Sun has already revealed that Gary will be back. </p>\n<p>\nDespite Simon's backing, the leaked video scandal showed no signs of easing up last night. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe man Tulisa says appears in the video  Justin Edwards  has made a series of claims about the origin of the six-minute film. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun can reveal that he told the X Factor judge's lawyers last October that he didn't have a copy of it. </p>\n<p>\nTulisa, who is said to be \"completely devastated\" by the leak, set the law firm on Edwards  known as MC Ultra  after apparently learning about the online leaks. </p>\n<p>\nIn response, he stated that he had \"no knowledge whatsoever of any tape\" and didn't have \"a tape such as you referred to at all\". </p>\n<p>\nHe added in his response to the lawyers: \"Even if I did which I do not, I would have no desire to publish them, simply because I would find that ungentlemanly.

But after a website this week started charging for downloads, her lawyers raced to London's High Court to have it taken offline. </p>\n<p>\nAnd on Wednesday night Tulisa admitted she WAS the woman in the film. </p>\n<p>\nThe singer  poised to launch a solo career  said on YouTube: \"When you share an intimate moment with someone you love, you never imagine that at any point it will be shared with people around the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's a pretty tough time for me, but I don't feel I should take the heat for it.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nc.robertson@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By COLIN ROBERTSON, TV Editor, and GARY O&rsquo;SHEA","teaser":"MUSIC guru Simon Cowell stands by Tulisa Contostavlos over her sex tape scandal","headline":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job","section":"showbiz","id":4212851,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNN2301TULI--53202_1476168a.jpg","subdeck":"X-rated video ... talent show judge Tulisa Contostavlos","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":true},{"isTop":1,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Tragic ...

I'm driven.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe chef, who has just opened a new restaurant Gregg's Table in Bermondsey, South London, told diners: \"I'm here all the time. I live here.

She loves my kids to death. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"She says she's prepared to look after them however long it takes, and I'm happy for them to stay with her. She's devoted to them.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe denied the 17-year age gap was to blame for their split, insisting: \"We always joke that she's more mature than me  she says she's an old woman in a young woman's body. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"She's never been interested in fame. She didn't like coming to red carpet events. People thought she was interested in me because I'm famous, but nothing's further from the truth. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"She says she'll always be there for me. She wants to continue as my PA. She says she'll work for me for the next 30 years.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHeidi wrote on Twitter at the weekend: \"I can confirm that Gregg and I have separated. All amicable and still very close. He's a wonderful man.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nGregg has been bombarded with tweets from admirers  including one woman begging: \"Marry me!\" </p>\n<p>\nBut he said: \"I'm not interested in other women. Have you seen pictures of my wife? She's absolutely stunning.\" </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\na.lazzeri@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By ANTONELLA LAZZERI","teaser":"HEARTBROKEN Masterchef star Gregg Wallace reveals pain of split from third wife","headline":"TV Gregg: I still love my wife","section":"showbiz","id":4212635,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4212635/TV-Gregg-I-still-love-my-wife-I-dont-know-whats-gone-wrong.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNN2311A---532_1476027a.jpg","subdeck":"So in love ... star Gregg Wallace with Heidi","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":false},{"isTop":0,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Noel Gallagher ...

The world is so full of entertainment now, isn't it? So there are a lot of nerves. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's amazing to be back in music. I like the intimacy of a recording studio and song-writing. I'm using a different part of my brain when I work on music versus when I'm directing a film. </p>\n<p>\n\"There are a billion more people on a film and I don't have that visceral outlet of being able to sing, scream... jump around. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's very different. I love doing both but it was nice to have the simplicity of song-writing after three years of writing a script and directing and editing and talking about my film, to sit down and play my guitar and sing a song. I almost cried.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHer last studio album, Hard Candy in May 2008, experimented with a hip-hop influence. She collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and Timbaland. </p>\n<p>\nThe album reached No1 around the world but received a lukewarm reception from some fans and critics. </p>\n<p>\nMDNA, a \"triple entendre\" as she describes it, is a return to what she does best: classic pop songs with a sprinkling of trademark controversy. </p>\n<p>\n<i>And it is down to the return of her winning formula: working with top European producers.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nStuart Price produced some of her best original material on Confessions On A Dancefloor back in 2005. She also made some great material with French electronic guru Mirwais. </p>\n<p>\nBut her return to the studio with producer William Orbit, who made Ray Of Light back in 1998, is a master stroke. </p>\n<p>\nThe tracks they have made together on the new album, including Gang Bang and Some Girls, slot into her discography perfectly. </p>\n<p>\nShe has also employed the skills of Martin Solveig, Italian DJ Benny Benassi and his cousin Allessandro. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Madonna believes her return to Europe for her producing partners is no coincidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I think maybe I just have more of a European sensibility. People say that about my songs as well. I like working with people who are well-read and know what's going on in the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"Conversation is essential. With William, we always get into discussions about philosophy or quantum physics. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"With Martin Solveig we always end up getting in to discussions about foreign films. When I'm working with people I can't just write music, I have to be able to talk about life and the world, and art. Benny was a tricky one because he doesn't speak English very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was a little bit frustrating at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they're not. </p>\n<p>\n\"When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"Martin is such good fun, I adore him. You have to feel like you can say 'No, I don't like that,' and you're not going to hurt their feelings. And vice versa. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he's got just the right balance of seriousness and humour. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe production on the album is slick, with some great touches. </p>\n<p>\nOn Gang Bang the noise of a spent cartridge from a gun hitting a concrete floor illustrates her \"Kill Bill\" fantasy for the track. </p>\n<p>\nBut the contrast of a huge pop track like Superstar, featuring her daughter Lourdes on backing vocals, is followed up with a song called Falling Free  one of her most stripped-back songs for years. She explained: \"I have to be completely involved in the production. I like the contrast. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to have something that is just slammed with noise and sound and bass and drum, sensory overload and then create something like Falling Free, which is stripped back and all you can really hear is my voice and the lyrics. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes I sit down on a guitar and start strumming chords and things come out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes people bring a song to me that has a title, for instance, or an idea of a lyric and I take it and kind of re-shape it, re-word it and make it my own. It comes in so many different ways, it's always been that way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe album features some big collaborations with strong female solo stars  M.I.A and rapper Nicki Minaj. Give Me All Your Luvin' was the Superbowl song that ended up causing controversy when M.I.A decided to stick up her middle fin ger. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But that punk spirit is exactly why she got them on board.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was looking to collaborate with women who I think have a strong sense of themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were a lot of fun to be around in the studio, for sure. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think we were all shy of each other in the beginning, that's just human nature. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think we got over that pretty quickly. </p>\n<p>\n\"They're both very self-possessed people, especially M.I.A. I don't think she's impressed much by stars and celebrities, so we just got down to business. I loved her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the key to keeping the music original? Don't listen to chart music while you are writing. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I wasn't listening to anything to tell you the truth, when I wrote this. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was working on the soundtrack to my movie W.E. So just classical music. I actually don't like listening to pop music while I'm working on pop music  it doesn't really work. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"You don't want to hear other people's stuff, you need a clean slate to work off.\"</i>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 01:34:00 +0000","teaser":"TIME is precious for the mum of four  she has an album and tour to finish","headline":"Madonna: I like to work with people who talk about philosophy or quantum physics","section":"showbiz","id":4213093,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/sftw/4213093/Madonna-I-like-to-work-with-people-who-can-talk-about-philosophy-or-quantum-physics.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/madonna2-532_1476109a.jpg","subdeck":"Intelligent conversation ...

It is believed the Bodyguard star suffered a heart attack before slipping under the water and drowning. </p>\n<p>\nRelatives were said to be devastated at hearing cocaine was to blame. </p>\n<p>\nWhitney's family said in a statement: \"We are saddened to learn of the toxicology results, although we are glad to now have closure.\" </p>\n<p>\nHer mum Cissy, 79, and daughter Bobbi Kristina, 19, have been struggling to cope since the tragedy. </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCoroner's spokesman Craig Harvey confirmed Whitney appeared to have used cocaine \"in the time period immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub\". </p>\n<p>\nA report from the coroner's office stated: \"How injury occurred: Found submerged in a bathtub filled with water; cocaine intake.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt said Whitney also had marijuana, Benadryl, Xanax and other medication in her system</a>, but those drugs were NOT a factor. </p>\n<p>\nInvestigators had said they found no evidence of illegal drugs at the scene, although officials confirmed prescription pill bottles were found. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAmerican showbiz site TMZ reported sources that claimed a mystery individual removed any traces of cocaine from Whitney's hotel room. </p>\n<p>\nThey also alleged that the person who cleaned up the drugs had supplied them to the singer. </p>\n<p>\nIt added that Beverly Hills Police have confirmed their investigation into Whitney's death had not yet been finished. </p>\n<p>\nBut the site said cops would not comment on whether they were looking at any allegations of evidence tampering </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe coroner's report said her death was an accident, and added: \"No trauma or foul play is suspected.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe coroner's office said results indicated Whitney also suffered from heart disease that caused 60 per cent narrowing of her arteries. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAssistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said the condition is common in cocaine users. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It just beats up their heart and they will have a heart attack.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA final, more detailed, coroner's report will be released in two weeks. </p>\n<p>\nWhitney battled addiction to crack cocaine at the height of her fame.

Girls assume she is a porn star. Then there's the back pain. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Lots of women want big boobs but it's actually a total nightmare. </p>\n<p>\n\"The only men I attract are the sleazy type. It's rare that a guy looks me in the face when talking to me. </p>\n<p>\n\"Guys will flat-out stare and try all the cheesy chat-up lines. And a lot of the time they want their picture taken with them. Not me  <i>them</i>.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"Sometimes it can be a bit scary. A few blokes will try to get really hands-on. When I'm out with my male friends they'll usually circle round me. They're my bodyguards.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't fare much better with other girls. She says: \"Women assume my boobs are fake  they look at me like I'm a porn star. It's older women who always comment on them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They'll tut and shake their heads as they walk past me in the street. I can hear them saying, 'They're so fake', and, 'Look at her flaunting them'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I try to smile through it. I know they're real but sometimes it can be hurtful. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've developed a way of walking so my boobs bounce up and down and people can see they're real. It looks like I'm walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\n\"Women can get quite jealous  that's probably why I have more male friends.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut meeting the right guy is difficult. Glasgow girl Stephanie says: \"I broke up with my ex in 2010. He couldn't handle all the attention I get and became insanely jealous. </p>\n<p>\n\"When we were out he'd get mad when other guys checked me out. I tried telling him it couldn't be helped  he knew what he was getting into.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie has seen a few men since the split but no one special has caught her eye. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They become too obsessed with my boobs, it's all they think about. It's hard to find a guy to see past them. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of blokes are just after me for the status of it, they see it as just another notch on the bedpost. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I want my boyfriend to see me for me, I'm more than just a pair of boobs. I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half  but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs  though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that  it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By AMY JONES","teaser":"STEPHANIE'S back-breaking, all-natural boobs are subject of daily abuse from strangers","headline":"My natural 32K boobs are a nightmare...only sleazy blokes chat me up while girls tut and assume I'm a porn star","section":"woman","id":4212810,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212810/My-natural-32K-boobs-are-a-nightmare.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2330a---532_1476242a.jpg","subdeck":"'I have a walk to make them bounce to show they're real' ...

I'm logic personified. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back over my life, I tried to work out how and where the desire for independence began to make itself felt. </p>\n<p>\nAmong my earliest memories was when I was three and my mum Rita and nan Nina left me at home one day with my grandfather, Gerald, while they went shopping. </p>\n<p>\nI remember my mum and dad, Terry, had this elegant drinks cabinet in the lounge. As a toddler I was fascinated by it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe door folded down and all these beautiful little glasses and different-coloured bottles glinted away in the backlight. </p>\n<p>\nI decided to get a chair, climb up and have a good look. Everything looked even better close up. </p>\n<p>\nThe dainty little glasses (for sherry), the perfect size for me, were so tempting that I started to fill them with the green, yellow and clear liquids I saw in the bottles  cr&#232;me de menthe, advocaat and vodka. </p>\n<p>\nTaking little sips and inviting my dolls to do the same, I was having a wonderful time  until my grandfather came into the room and asked what I was doing. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, as soon as he twigged, he told me to stop. Three-year-old me instantly replied: \"This is my house and I'll do as I want.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe left me to it. He was married to my grandmother, so perhaps he knew not to pick a losing fight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Not surprisingly, when my mum and nan got home I was rolling drunk and, by all accounts, not much more co-operative.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather got an earful, I was put to bed and the story passed into family lore. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs my nan used to tell me: \"You were such a little cow  and you know what? You weren't sick, not once. Not a drop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got that streak in you as a toddler, no one's ever going to be able to tell you what to do when you're fully grown. </p>\n<p>\n<i>It wasn't a one-off, either.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA few months later my mum took me to school for the very first time. </p>\n<p>\nPicking me up after my first day, she asked the teacher how I had got on. She had been worried, my mum admitted, because I was very shy. </p>\n<p>\n\"Which one is your daughter?\" the teacher asked. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady,\" said my mother. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady?\" was the incredulous response. \"Shy? She walked in, pulled a boy off his chair and said, 'That's my seat. Move.' I wouldn't be worried if I was you!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was advice my mother took to heart. In fact, that was probably the last time she worried about me. </p>\n<p>\nThere were other powerful influences in my childhood. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of my grandmothers were hard workers, strong women and very important in moulding me. </p>\n<p>\nI was very close to Nina, my mother's mother, in particular, who put an end to that alcoholic tea party when I was three. She was dynamite. She was Italian  from Naples  and incredibly feisty. She would have killed for her family  she wouldn't have thought twice about it. </p>\n<p>\nIf someone cut up my grandfather in traffic, she would get out of the car and punch them on the nose. </p>\n<p>\nI'm sure it won't come as any surprise when I say she was definitely the one in control of her house and marriage. </p>\n<p>\nShe was great with money  not because she had a lot but because she knew the price of everything and she was in charge. </p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather went out to work as a postman but she would take his wages and give him cash to spend. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThat was just the way it was. Grandma Nina really believed in me. Her attitude was: You can do it, so go out there and get on with it. </p>\n<p>\nEven if I get a bit feisty at home now, my husband will still say to me, \"Oh, Nina's here. Nina's coming out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>I was fiercely determined. If I wanted something and my parents wouldn't give it to me, I would find a way to get it for myself.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI was never given pocket money. My parents always offered to buy me what I wanted but I wanted to be in charge of my own money. </p>\n<p>\nI recall them once saying no to something  I can't remember what it was  but I haven't forgotten what I decided to do. I put up signs in my bedroom window  it was my bedroom so I could do what I liked, I reasoned  saying, \"Massages, manicures, come inside!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mother was shouting up: \"Who are all these weirdos coming to the door?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I bawled back: \"They're my customers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI was bloody-minded too. I once put up a Vote Labour poster in my bedroom just because my parents were Conservatives. </p>\n<p>\nMy dad roared: \"Take that down!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"It's my bedroom!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"What does the poster even mean?\" And I didn't know, of course. I just knew it would wind him up and cause a debate. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 14, I'd tell my mum I was going to stay the night with my best friend, Charlotte, who would tell her mum she was staying at my house. </p>\n<p>\nAfter that we would meet up with our clothes in carrier bags, get changed, take the Tube into central London then go out in Soho. </p>\n<p>\nWhen everything closed we'd walk around until the Tube re-started in the early morning and go back to our borough  Enfield in north London. </p>\n<p>\nThen we walked around until 10am before we went home. </p>\n<p>\nMum would say, \"Well, you look very tired.\" But she never knew. Years later, when I told her, she was shocked. But I was even more shocked by what she said to me. </p>\n<p>\nShe looked at my daughter Sophie and said: \"What goes around, comes around.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI went very cold and felt terrible about what I had done. </p>\n<p>\nBut at the time I couldn't have cared less. </p>\n<p>\nNothing was going to happen to me. I was in control, I was safe  or at least I thought I was. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But if I imagine my 15-year-old Sophie going out all night now, well...</i> </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nThe day I made a name for myself </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nMY school had lots of careers days and companies came in and talked to us, including advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the London radio station LBC. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLots of people were interested but whereas everybody thought maybe they'd write to them, I got all the right details before the people left. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe next day I was on the phone making appointments. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoth companies I was interested in offered me a job. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI chose Saatchi, leaving school on the Friday and starting work there the following Monday. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I was only 18, they put me on their graduate programme. I suppose they saw something in me. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I loved it, the programme was very rigid, so finally I got impatient and moved instead to LBC as a 19-year-old selling radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been given Asian Hour to sell, which was pretty tough  a 4am to 5am slot, the real graveyard shift. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been handed a list of companies that spent money on advertising but who didn't advertise on radio. One was Sport Newspapers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI got through to owner David Sullivan on the phone and he wasn't interested, saying \"radio didn't work\". </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI decided I would drop off some material at his office  persistence is everything  and once I was there I decided to wait to meet him in person. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI waited and waited and waited and in the end he agreed to see me because I had waited so long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI did a very quick pitch to him and he wasn't buying it at all, so I said: \"Look, if you take the advertising and sales don't go up, you don't have to pay for it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"That sounds good to me.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI didn't have the authority to do a deal like that, so it was a risk  but I remember thinking, \"Well, if it doesn't work out, what's the worst that can happen? They can fire me but I can always get another job. I'm only 19.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI still use that kind of thinking and I have done all my life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact, it's the foundation of my confidence and my ability to take risks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt worked out. Sales went up and, within months, Sullivan was spending more than &#163;2million a year on radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI was managing it all and earning more commission than all the other sales staff put together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen he offered me a job, which I accepted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat episode is often considered to have been a turning point in my professional life but, in truth, I think my life had been heading that way since I was a young child. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Adapted by BEN JACKSON</b> <b>Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, by Karren Brady, is published by HarperCollins on March 29, &#163;18.99.</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"FUNNY anecdotes from the Apprentice star and West Ham vice-chairman's new book","headline":"Brady: I told Grandad, I'll do what I like","section":"woman","id":4212917,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212917/Karren-Brady-Sipping-vodka-aged-3-I-told-Grandad-Ill-do-what-I-like.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf23bran1--532_1476008a.jpg","subdeck":"Driven ...

As far back as 1877 a statue of Venus de Milo was the subject of a court case when a gardener was caught trying to have sex with \"her\". </p>\n<p>\nMore recently, American Edward Smith has expressed his love for his VW Beetle, Vanilla, though he admits having \"relationships\" with many vehicles. </p>\n<p>\nHis most intense sexual experience was \"making love\" to a helicopter from the Eighties TV series Airwolf  but his major love is cars. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEdward said: \"I go a little bit beyond appreciating the beauty of a car, to the point of what I feel is an expression of love. </p>\n<p>\n\"I write poetry about cars, I sing to them and talk to them like a girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not sick. Cars are just my preference.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe told earlier this month how Leeds shop assistant Amanda Whittaker, 27, has fallen for the Statue of Liberty, or \"Libby\" as she knows her. At school she loved a drum kit. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1979, Eija-Riitta Ekl&#246;f from Sweden \"married\" the Berlin Wall. Eija, who changed her surname to Berliner-Mauer, coined the term Objectum Sexual (OS) for her unconventional orientation. </p>\n<p>\nMrs Berliner-Mauer says her \"long-distance\" relationship survived the \"tragedy\" of the wall being pulled down in 1989  but she has fallen for a red fence. Former US soldier Erika LaBrie, 41, pledged to love, honour and obey the Eiffel Tower in an intimate ceremony in Paris in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nErika Eiffel founded the Objectum Sexuality Internationale group which has more than 40 members and a website. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOther \"inanimate lovers\" revealed by objectophiles include a cartoon character, steam locomotives, words, public buildings and a hydraulic flood barrier. </p>\n<p>\nSan Francisco sexologist Dr Amy Marsh carried out a scientific survey involving 21 objectophiles and found cars, trains and aircraft are the most common objects of desire. </p>\n<p>\nBut more women than men are objectophiles and they are more likely to love structures. </p>\n<p>\nDr Marsh said: \"OS transcends fetishism and is experienced as a sexual and/ or affectionate orientation with an array of emotions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It does not seem to be caused by trauma or delusional psychiatric conditions, though it does seem linked with autism. </p>\n<p>\n\"Professionals need to learn more about OS and treat OS patients with the same respect they do for other sexual preference minorities.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information go to dramymarshsexologist.com</a>. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nm.phillips@the-sun.co.uk </a> </a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:01:00 +0000","byline":"By MARTIN PHILLIPS, Senior Feature Writer","teaser":"MEET the 'objectophiles'  a growing number of people who are attracted to objects","headline":"The best sex of my life?","section":"woman","id":4212923,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212923/Meet-the-people-attracted-to-objects.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2322gn-5323_1476064a.jpg","subdeck":"Flight of fancy ...

I blamed the bad smells on the dog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nConstantly banning herself from the food she loves has made Alison's adult life a misery. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My hatred of being big has meant I have spent every day on a dieting roller coaster. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a fad diet junkie. It has become an addiction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Alison's first diet memory goes back to when she was just 13. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll never forget the anxiety I felt when a shop girl told my mum there wasn't a school dress big enough for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I squeezed into the size they had and trundled off to secondary school tugging at the hemline in embarrassment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter being called \"fatty\" in that first year at school, Alison embarked on her first diet. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum had the Scarsdale Diet book and for six weeks I had grapefruit for breakfast, protein and salad for lunch and protein and veg for tea. </p>\n<p>\n\"Although I was always starving and grumpy, I stuck to it and lost a stone over the summer holidays and hit my goal weight of 8st. </p>\n<p>\n\"Even though I wasn't as skinny as some of my friends, I was just so happy to have been accepted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as soon as Alison stopped the diet plan, she shot back up to 9st, large for her 5ft 6in frame. </p>\n<p>\nSo she was actually <b>HAPPY</b> when she contracted glandular fever at the age of 16. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost a stone effortlessly  I was thrilled. I battled to stay that size but the weight I'd lost on the 'Glandular Fever Diet' didn't stay off. </p>\n<p>\n\"As soon as the biscuit barrel was in sight, I piled on the weight.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison's obsession got worse when she found even quicker fixes. Within six months of turning 19, she had tried the Fit For Life Diet, the Egg And Grapefruit Diet and the Banana Diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I even tried the Lunch Box Diet. The idea is that you fill a lunch box up with lots of healthy food. That was great... until I started replacing the salad with chocolate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring her twenties, Alison's weight fluctuated between a healthy 9½st and 10st  but she longed to be a stone lighter again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA turning point in her dieting nightmare came when she married Frank, a photographer, now 48, in 1988 when she was 22. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost half a stone through a combination of nerves and WeightWatchers but, again, it didn't stay off. Within a year, I'd gone to almost 11st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison got desperate and started the meal replacement Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Within two months I was down to 8½st but, boy, it was hard. It was worth it though. I was slim and loving it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYo-yo dieting her way through the Eighties, Alison would spend hours researching gimmicks to keep herself below 10st  until she became pregnant for the first time in 1991. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I embraced eating for two and indulged in whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I looked massive. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was more than 14st when I gave birth to Charlie, who is now 20.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Afterwards, Alison got straight back into her fad diet cycle and spent a fortune on books and consultations to get back down to her beloved 9st. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she explains: \"Just as I hit the 10st mark, I found out I was pregnant with baby No2. </p>\n<p>\n\"Again, I ate for Britain. This time I was 13½st when I gave birth to Olivia in 1995.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce more, Alison threw herself into a host of different diets. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"You name it, I tried it. I'd feel motivated at the beginning and lose a few pounds but then I'd have a blip and pig out for a few days before embarking on another 'new' diet, telling myself this would be 'the one'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison did not manage to slim down before becoming pregnant again in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nThe cycle of gorging and dieting continued after daughter Florence was born in 2001, and Alison flitted between 11 and 12½st. </p>\n<p>\nTwo years ago, Alison's husband told her he was worried because her stomach was bigger than her bust. </p>\n<p>\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan had worked for her in the past and, amazingly, she lost three-and-a-half stone in just three months. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"At last I was 10st again. I stayed at that weight for six months by cutting out carbs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I looked great but missed bread and pasta.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut gradually the carbs slipped back on to her plate and Alison now admits: \"I'm back to 12st... oh all right, 12½st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hate being this big but I can't face another liquid replacement diet  unless the liquid is Sauvignon Blanc. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Most of all, I'm sick of knowing that if I could just eat less and exercise more, my weight would naturally decrease. Perhaps then I would finally be happy.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nALISON'S DIETS </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n1. The Scarsdale </p>\n<p>\n2.

Sian, 20, who lives with her parents in Welwyn, Kent, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdam was such a fit young man that even now it's hard to accept he died so suddenly. </p>\n<p>\nWe were enjoying a family holiday in Cyprus. Just minutes before he died, Adam had been laughing and playing water volleyball. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then he said he felt unwell. He got out and sat on the side of the pool  before suddenly collapsing head first into the water. </p>\n<p>\nMy parents and I had gone for a walk and a friend of Adam's dashed to find us. By the time we got back, Adam had been pulled out of the pool. </p>\n<p>\nAn ambulance was on its way and a nurse was desperately giving him the kiss of life, trying to restart his heart. </p>\n<p>\nNow we know Adam had had a cardiac arrest. Tragically, it was too late to save him. </p>\n<p>\nTwo post-mortems  one in Cyprus and one in the UK  confirmed he died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nFor years we believed it was something peculiar to Adam. Then two years ago Cry, The Sudden Death Charity, suggested the family should all be screened. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum Julie, 50, had heart checks first  and, astoundingly, was diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nCommonly associated with Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, it is an inherited condition that affects the heart's rhythm. A year later I too was diagnosed with it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a shock to realise this syndrome was undoubtedly responsible for Adam's death in 2004 and the deaths of many other young people. </p>\n<p>\nWe then discovered it can be picked up by a simple ECG. Had Adam been tested his death could have been prevented. </p>\n<p>\nIn July 2010 I had a mini defibrillator fitted. </p>\n<p>\nIt is terrible to think Adam's death has probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\nThat's why I believe everyone should undergo a routine heart trace at 14. If an irregular heartbeat is detected, doctors can investigate further. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nNick Dias </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ASSISTANT site manager Nick collapsed in December and has now been fitted with a pacemaker. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The 27-year-old lives with fianc&#233;e Lynsey, 25, and their children, Brooke, five, and Riley, seven months, in Radlett, Herts. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a non-smoker, who is slim and exercises regularly, I never imagined I would have a heart problem. </p>\n<p>\nBut in December last year Lynsey and I were walking Brooke to school and after bending down to get her schoolbag from Riley's pushchair I passed out. </p>\n<p>\nSeconds later I came round to find Lynsey looking very concerned. Apparently I'd fallen backwards and cracked my head on the pavement. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe assumed I'd fainted and carried on walking Brooke to school. But as we did so, Lynsey became more worried because I started talking gibberish  I kept repeating myself and asking strange questions. </p>\n<p>\nAfter dropping Brooke off, Lynsey insisted on driving me to A&amp;E at Watford General Hospital. She was worried I might have concussion. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctor said because I'd passed out, he wanted to check my heart. And I was horrified when the ECG detected a problem with the rhythm of my heart. </p>\n<p>\nTerrifyingly, the doctor said I was suffering from heart block where the electrical impulses that make the heart beat don't always reach the heart. </p>\n<p>\nI was lucky my heart had started beating again  but next time I might not be so lucky and if I wasn't treated, could have a full-blown cardiac arrest. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors have been unable to find a reason for my heart block. As they have also found a slight problem with a heart valve, it is possibly something I was born with. </p>\n<p>\nSince then I've had a pacemaker fitted. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors say when the children are ten they will have to be tested too. </p>\n<p>\nBut it's something I feel should be routinely tested for in everyone. If it weren't for Lynsey insisting I go to A&amp;E that day, I might not have discovered this. </p>\n<p>\nAnd ultimately I could have suddenly suffered a potentially fatal cardiac arrest at any time. </p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By LYNSEY HAYWOOD","teaser":"AS Bolton's Fabrice Muamba recovers from heart attack, we show you how to save a life","headline":"What would YOU do?","section":"woman","id":4210291,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210291/What-would-YOU-do-if-someone-collapsed-in-front-of-you.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H2G-_1475241a.jpg","subdeck":"Cardiac arrest ...

Aspirin works by suppressing the creation of prostaglandin, a hormone that carries information about pain to the brain. It was first sold as 1899 as a powder by the German firm Bayer. </p>\n<p>\nAspirin can clearly do more than banish headaches, though some experts believe it could do more harm than good. </p>\n<p>\nHere, we look at some of the surprising uses. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDepression </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSOME experts believe depression and inflammation could be linked after small studies found some depressed people have high levels of cytokines  naturally occurring chemicals with inflammatory properties  in the body. </p>\n<p>\nSo because it's an anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin might be able to help. </p>\n<p>\nOne study followed 386 women for ten years  22 developed depression after the age of 50. </p>\n<p>\nOf these only one had taken aspirin. </p>\n<p>\nBut among those who did not develop depression, almost a third were taking it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAcne </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA KEY ingredient in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is used in many of today's off-the-shelf acne products. </p>\n<p>\nMix a tablet with water then rub the solution on to your skin. </p>\n<p>\nLeave it on for two minutes, then rinse off. </p>\n<p>\nThis will dry your pimples out and your spots will go faster. </p>\n<p>\nIf you have normal or dry skin don't try this more than once a week as you will lose too much moisture from your skin. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nDandruff </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA COMMON cause of this is a tiny yeast called Pityroporum ovale, which lives on the scalp. Aspirin is a mild anti-fungal so it can help. </p>\n<p>\nCrush two tablets and mix them with one serving of shampoo. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture to your hair and leave for about two minutes so it can settle on your scalp. </p>\n<p>\nRinse it off and shampoo your hair again. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDementia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSTUDIES have found that Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is an inflammatory condition of the brain so aspirin might be effective in treating it. </p>\n<p>\nResearch carried out in Utah, involving the observation and testing of more than 3,000 people, suggested taking it could reduce the risk of contracting the condition by 23 per cent. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nHeart disease </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIT IS thought it can help by reducing inflammation in the arteries that supply the heart  making the blood less likely to become sticky and form a deadly clot. </p>\n<p>\nIn some studies, taking aspirin reduced the likelihood of a cardiovascular problem, including heart disease, heart attack or stroke, by as much as 44 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nExperts also found it can help someone who has already had a heart attack or a stroke by reducing the risk of having another by a third. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAthlete's Foot </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nATHLETE'S foot and other fungal infections can be treated using a few aspirin pills and talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nGrind three pills until they are in a powder form. </p>\n<p>\nThen mix the powdered aspirin with some talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture on to the infected area of skin. </p>\n<p>\nDo this process twice a day to kill the fungi and to treat the irritation. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nIn-growing hair </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHAVE you got a painful in-growing hair that won't budge? </p>\n<p>\nAspirin is made up of acetylsalicylic acid, which exfoliates skin and has anti-inflammatory properties. </p>\n<p>\nSo applying a thick paste made of crushed aspirin and a little warm water could help you remove it with ease. </p>\n<p>\nApply it to the hair and leave to settle for ten to 15 minutes. Then remove using warm water. </p>\n<p>\nThis should get rid of the hair, or at least make it easier to remove. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nPre-eclampsia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA DAILY dose of aspirin during pregnancy could cut the risk of pre-eclampsia, a condition that threatens the lives of both mother and baby. </p>\n<p>\nA study of 32,000 women published in The Lancet medical journal found that mums who took it were ten per cent less likely to develop the condition. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nInsect bites </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAS these are marked by redness, itchiness and sometimes a burning sensation, aspirin  an anti-inflammatory  can help clear these up. </p>\n<p>\nWet the affected area and rub a small aspirin over the skin to help relieve the pain caused by mosquito bites or stings from a bee, wasp or hornet. </p>\n<p>\nTaking it orally could also help to reduce any painful swelling. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nShingles </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nASPIRIN is thought to be one of the most effective treatments for dealing with the pain and uncomfortable symptoms associated with shingles. </p>\n<p>\nMash two tablets into a paste and use a clean cotton swab to apply it to the skin. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nThe risks... </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<li></li> ONE in five asthmatics are at risk of a severe reaction to aspirin, according to research in Australia and the UK. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A recent London University study linked taking aspirin with a 30 per cent rise in the risk of debilitating  and potentially fatal  internal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A study last January advised doctors to stop prescribing aspirin to ward off heart attacks as it raises the risk of bleeding in the stomach by a third. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Oxford researchers say a daily dose as small as 75mg could increase the risk of abdominal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Anyone with an allergy to aspirin or a bleeding or clotting disorder should not use it for any purpose. </p>\n<p>\n<b>If in doubt, consult your GP.</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 01:04:00 +0000","teaser":"MANY illnesses and now even CANCER could apparently be prevented by taking aspirin","headline":"Aspirin's not just for headaches","section":"woman","id":4210700,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210700/The-drug-that-can-treat-depression-dementia-cancer-and-in-growing-hairs.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22ASP---_1475246a.jpg","subdeck":"Painless ... aspirin has been hailed as a treatment for depression, dementia and even cancer","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":true},{"isTop":0,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"'Cameron fills my life with love and joy' ...

Having Cameron has been the making of me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lad is also a brilliant big brother to Luke, ten, Jake, four, Mackenzie, two, and four-month-old Brooklyn. </p>\n<p>\nAs the Down's Syndrome Association runs its awareness campaign this week, courageous Crystal, 27, revealed how Cameron has made her a better person. </p>\n<p>\nAround one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down's and there are 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough the chance of a baby having Down's is higher for older mothers, more babies with Down's are born to younger women  because they have more children. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal fell pregnant at 15 and as the likelihood of having a Down's baby was considered so rare for a mum-to-be of her age, doctors had not even asked if she wanted to be tested. </p>\n<p>\nLike many women, Crystal assumed only older mums had Down's children. She admits when she was first told of her son's diagnosis at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire, she was horrified and ashamed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was still getting my head round the fact he had Down's when three hours after his birth he was whisked off for a scan. </p>\n<p>\n\"When they brought my baby back and told me he had three holes in his heart and would need a major op to fix it, I just fell apart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe devastated teenager sobbed in her mother's arms. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home in Wetherby, West Yorks, sharing a room with her sister and her new tot made life even harder. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I couldn't bear to go out, not because I didn't want to show him off but I was so scared he would die. </p>\n<p>\n\"He seemed so vulnerable and I was way out of my depth. I sobbed myself to sleep every night and kept thinking 'why me?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCameron's dad, 16-year-old Drew, stood by her  visiting the pair regularly. But Crystal was convinced he would leave her. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"All his mates were out clubbing and he was a 16-year-old lad with a baby with Down's.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt three months old Cameron went in for the op to fix the holes in his heart. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal was warned he would be in hospital for up to three months but after just three weeks he was doing so well he was discharged. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home, while most girls her age were out having fun, 16-year-old Crystal was caring for a very sick baby. Then something amazing happened. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Cameron just fought and fought and suddenly I realised it was time to stop feeling sorry for myself. I gave myself a massive boot up the backside. </p>\n<p>\n\"OK, my son wasn't the perfect baby but he was my son and he deserved a mum who would fight for him all the way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDrew and Crystal moved in together and the teen parents learnt Makaton, a language programme using signs and symbols, so they could communicate with Cameron as he grew up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Being able to sign was a major bonus. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Cameron and I formed a remarkable bond and suddenly I realised his disability was anything but.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Crystal fell pregnant with another child when Cameron was just 18 months old, a few friends said she wouldn't be able to cope. </p>\n<p>\nShe was offered a nuchal scan to determine the likelihood of Down's, but turned it down. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I didn't want to know. I coped with Cameron and I knew I'd cope again.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBaby Luke was born healthy, as was Jake two years after. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"The specialists don't know why I had a baby with Down's so young and then it never occurred again. They say it's extremely rare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Cameron was seven, Crystal split from his dad, suddenly finding herself a single mum to three boys. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I'm not saying it was easy but dealing with Cameron gave me the strength to deal with anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Some people close to me thought I would have a breakdown but it was actually Cameron that kept me going. </p>\n<p>\n\"He developed this really cheeky, funny personality. He had me in stitches and when I was down he seemed to sense it and would give me a cuddle. He's just so happy I couldn't be sad around him.\" </p>\n<p>\nCrystal has since found love with 21-year-old shop worker Darren Hooper. The couple have two sons. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Life's good. Cameron goes to a special needs school which he loves and has really boosted his speech and learning. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll admit that when I first heard my little boy had Down's I reached the depths of despair but now I don't see him as a boy with problems. </p>\n<p>\n\"I see him for what he is  an unbelievably loving little boy who loves cuddles and has tons of affection and love to give. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I know people thought I didn't have the maturity to cope but having Cameron has been the making of me.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Crystal has high hopes for Cameron's future: \"I would love him to move out of home, get a job, marry and go on to have his own family one day and there's no reason why he can't achieve any of those dreams. </p>\n<p>\n\"Cameron has ambitions like any boys his age. He loves playing sports and listening to Lady GaGa. </p>\n<p>\n\"He tells me he wants to be a footballer one day and I tell him he should aim high and go for it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Every child, no matter if they have Down's syndrome, should be given a chance to prove what they can do and lead as ordinary a life as possible.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSarah offers other parents hope </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nDOWN'S syndrome actress Sarah Gordy is proof that people with disabilities can lead a full and rewarding life. </p>\n<p>\nThe 34-year-old  who plays Lady Pamela on BBC drama Upstairs Downstairs  has starred in many TV shows and plays. And her mum Jane, 63, could not be more proud of her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jane, speaking about discovering her first-born had Down's syndrome, admitted: \"Being completely honest, if I was given a test and told my baby had Down's I would have considered a termination. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'd have been terrified about not being able to look after her. But that saddens me now. </p>\n<p>\n\"When I fell pregnant I wasn't ready to be a mum. In my 20s at the time, I'd never changed a nappy so I felt very unprepared. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Sarah was born I couldn't believe how beautiful she was.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane didn't have any tests for Down's syndrome because she was under 28 when she fell pregnant. But the paediatrician noticed Sarah had the condition from the moment he saw her. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"Calling my husband Jerry aside, he told him that Sarah had the condition. Not only that, but he asked him not to tell me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He said it was important for me to form a bond with Sarah first. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking back I don't know how poor Jerry kept it to himself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt wasn't until four days later that Jane found out. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was heartbroken and terrified I would lose my baby. He kept telling me about potential heart problems and operations she'd need. </p>\n<p>\n\"But finding out turned me from a girl into a fully-fledged mother.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily, Sarah didn't need any operations. Jane said: \"I wish I knew back then what I know now, about how much of an amazing life she'd have.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane had another daughter, Catherine, now 32, 16 months after Sarah and admits she felt relief when tests showed she did not have Down's. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"I just didn't know if having two children with the condition would be too much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wish parents-to-be were provided with more information about Down's syndrome before they make a decision about termination. </p>\n<p>\n\"No one should ever feel pressured either way, but it's such a difficult decision to make without knowing exactly what it will entail.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile everything took longer with Sarah, Jane says she soon realised her daughter had an incredible ability to feel what other people feel. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"If I'm ever stressed or worried and I tell Sarah I'm fine she will say, 'No you're not,' and I have to come clean. We're very close as no emotion goes unnoticed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Jane explains that Down's syndrome actors work very differently to those without the condition. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The interesting thing about Sarah is she doesn't really act. She feels very emotional on set. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't fake emotion, so instead she believes everything about her character. </p>\n<p>\n\"Once she was acting as an abused wife and I saw how much the abusive words were hurting her. </p>\n<p>\n\"When she came off set I said, 'Sarah  you're a beautiful, successful actress' and she slowly remembered that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to think that Sarah being successful on TV gives parents who are expecting a Down's syndrome child strength and confidence that their child can lead a really healthy life.\"\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL BOYS, Chief Executive at Down's Syndrome Association</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWE have seen great improvements in the lives of people with Down's syndrome since the association's formation in 1970. </p>\n<p>\nToday, the average life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome is 60 to 65 years, compared to 35 to 40 back in 1970.

Sick of her unhealthy lifestyle and size 18 waist, Linda decided to ditch booze for good. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I was stuck in a destructive routine of drinking and eating too much. </p>\n<p>\nI'd just broken up with my boyfriend and wanted to move on. I'd read about the LighterLife diet and wanted to give it a go. </p>\n<p>\nOvernight I gave up alcohol and started eating four food packs a day, containing 5-600 calories. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a complete shock to the system and the first week was really hard, but I knew it would be worth it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI used to drink a bottle of wine most nights, on Fridays I'd have work drinks and Saturdays I'd be out drinking with non-work friends. </p>\n<p>\nSundays were spent recovering. It was relentless. Drinking with clients and colleagues was part of my life and I'd got myself into really bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only after I gave it up I noticed what a big impact it had. </p>\n<p>\nNow after a work night out I'll come into the office whistling and full of energy, while my colleagues are often a step behind me. And I remember all the office gossip! </p>\n<p>\nIt's been five months now and I feel stronger, more confident and I have more energy than ever before. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from 14st 9lb to 12st, from a size 18-16 to a size 14-12  and I know I look as good as I feel. </p>\n<h1>\nLaura Coventry, 33 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDDING photographer Laura, from Glasgow, went teetotal two years ago after bingeing on boozy nights out left her with huge memory blanks. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most girls in their twenties and thirties I lived for the weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThe prospect of partying and heavy drinking got me through the working week and I'd wish away Monday to Friday. </p>\n<p>\nI drank a lot, not just a couple of glasses of wine, but enough to get seriously drunk. I just loved the euphoria and the buzz that it gave me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd suffer terrible hangovers, I'd regularly be in bed until 5pm with headaches and feeling sick, but I saw it as a price worth paying to let my inhibitions go. </p>\n<p>\nOn occasions I'd been out with friends, woken up with a shocking hangover  and realised there were huge blanks in my night out I couldn't remember. </p>\n<p>\nIt really scared me and for the first time I questioned why I was doing this to myself. I knew I had to change. </p>\n<p>\nThe first two weeks were the hardest, but I managed the first three-month goal I set myself, then extended that to six months. </p>\n<p>\nNow not one drop of booze has passed my lips since February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nSome friends want me to start going out drinking with them again and say that I've proven my point, but I'm determined not to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI have a fantastic new boyfriend now and I wake up on Mondays smiling, something which never happened before. </p>\n<p>\nI still party but I don't need alcohol to get a buzz. Life feels so much fuller and better. </p>\n<h1>\nLucy Troughton, 31 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>IT was last October when Lucy went teetotal after realising the damaging effect alcohol was having on her mood. The waitress, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI lived in London between the ages of 19 to 22 and I was out drinking socially most nights. But when I fell pregnant at 23 I didn't drink for the best part of a year. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not that I missed it but I still felt very young to be stuck at home, not out partying like I used to. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a band so drinking was almost expected of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of my friends didn't have kids so there was always someone around to go out drinking with. I soon reverted back to weekend drinking. </p>\n<p>\nI got stuck in a rut of Mondays being a write-off, like I was waiting for the day to finish the moment I woke up. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to be on form for my daughter Grace, now seven, but I was tired and only realised when it was too late that I was becoming depressed. </p>\n<p>\nIn mid-October last year I decided enough was enough and gave up alcohol completely. </p>\n<p>\nIt was, and still is, very hard. I didn't go out and became a bit of a recluse, focusing more on my music, gardening and reading. </p>\n<p>\nIt's had a huge effect and I really love the mornings now. </p>\n<p>\nI feel so clear-headed. And people often comment on how I'm 'glowing' now. </p>\n<p>\nThe idea of a glass of wine with a meal is still a temptation but it does get easier to say \"No\". </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal has taught me what I really value. And I'm happier than ever. </p>\n<h1>\nKatie Carr, 22 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BARMAID Katie from Bridlington, East Yorks, was a beer-swilling, pizza-scoffing ladette. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She went teetotal in July 2010 after binge drinking caused her to have a seizure and a new love interest persuaded her to transform her life. Katie says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTequila, sambuca, J&#228;gerbombs  I wasn't fussy. I could get through 20 pints of lager in a night. </p>\n<p>\nIn June 2010, I'd been fired from my job as a waitress for consistently turning up to work reeking of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree weeks later, I'd spent &#163;1,200 in my local pub. I put on nine stone in a year on a diet of booze and pizza, weighed 18.5st and was a size 22. I didn't wear make-up or dress girly. </p>\n<p>\nOne night in July, I was out with friends when I had a seizure in a nightclub. </p>\n<p>\nI was carried out by a bouncer and taken to hospital by ambulance. The doctor instructed me to stop drinking for six weeks while they ran tests. </p>\n<p>\nWhile I was sober, I had time to re-evaluate who I was. </p>\n<p>\nWanting to seize the day, I contacted the bouncer and asked him, \"When are you going to take me out?\". I was amazed when he said later that week. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the CT scans came back clear  I'd just drunk too much. I've not been back on the booze since and have now lost eight stone. </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal is one of the best things I've ever done. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from ladette to lady. </p>\n<h1>\nRebecca Spencer, 35 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE charity worker from Southend, Essex, went teetotal seven years ago after a charity trip shocked her into a lifestyle change. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2003 I moved to London from Newcastle in search of a new job. </p>\n<p>\nI had a big group of friends and we used to go out every weekend and always drank a lot of vodka. It was just something we did and I didn't see it as a problem. </p>\n<p>\nIn 2005 I embarked on a charity trip with Help The Aged to India to photograph how people were rebuilding their lives after the 2004 tsunami. </p>\n<p>\nIt was the most eye-opening, inspiring and horrendous experience, all at the same time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe destruction was overpowering and having an alcoholic drink in that context seemed completely ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nThe experience changed my values and made me completely reassess myself. </p>\n<p>\nJust a few days after being in India I was in Covent Garden surrounded by young professionals knocking back drinks without a thought. </p>\n<p>\nI'd seen people with absolutely nothing and I decided to re-focus my life on the things that counted. Alcohol seemed such a self-destructive extravagance. </p>\n<p>\nAs soon as I gave up I realised I'd never even really liked the taste of alcohol  it was just the social side of it I enjoyed. </p>\n<p>\nNine months after the charity trip I fell pregnant and later had my son. </p>\n<p>\nI felt great and no part of me wanted to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI've been teetotal for seven years now and feel healthier, more energetic and have much more in my pocket  why go back? </p>","timestamp":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"INCREASING numbers of people are binning alcohol  here five women reveal what it's like to live without booze","headline":"Why we're all tee totally happy","section":"woman","id":4205741,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/SNF20BOOZE--_1474058a.jpg","subdeck":"On the wagon ...

Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper.

It appears to have a pretty instant effect that lasts for about 30 minutes per cigarette. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The stronger the nicotine content, the greater this metabolism-boosting effect. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Smoking also seems to help to suppress the appetite. It does this in part by helping to block the action of chemicals in the brain that stimulate hunger. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But it is important to put things into perspective and to appreciate that, although some people do put on a lot of weight after quitting cigarettes, the average gain is between three and ten pounds. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The good news is that some experts report that using nicotine patches helps to lower appetite, and that those who use them while trying to quit gain less weight than those who do not. Having regular 'doses' of carbohydrate may also help to beat the hunger pangs which may be triggered by quitting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"And on the day you decide to give up, make sure you have breakfast and keep up this habit. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Not having anything to eat first thing can be a real problem because, by mid-morning, your body will not only be craving its usual nicotine fix but will also have low blood sugar. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is important when giving up smoking to remember that, even though cigarettes appear to help a bit in the battle of the bulge, there are plenty of slim people who do not smoke and plenty of overweight people who do smoke. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Continuing to smoke because you think giving up will make you fat is no excuse not to try quitting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Doing so could well save your life.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<b>5 point weight proof plan</b>\n</h2>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1. </b>Don't give up when you are tired. Being tired always makes you more hungry. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>2. </b>Throw out fattening foods that might tempt you. If you can't do this, put them in a cupboard away from day-to-day foods so you are not constantly seeing them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>3.</b> Stock up on healthy snacks such as satsumas, grapes, low-fat yogurts, small 30g servings of nuts like almonds, cashews and peanuts and some miniature dark-chocolate Green &amp; Black's bars that you can nibble on when the nicotine withdrawal triggers hunger pangs. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.</b> Drink at least six to eight cups or mugs of fluids each day to help keep hydrated. Being dehydrated can make you stressed and grumpy. It is not a good idea to try to quit caffeine-containing drinks at the same time as giving up cigarettes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>5.</b> Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a small snack in between to ensure that levels of sugar in your blood are steady and stable. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEggs on toast, cereal or fruit salad and yogurt make good breakfasts. </p>\n<p>\nTuna, chicken or hummus-stuffed pitta or wraps are examples of energy-extending lunches and spaghetti Bolognese, baked potato with baked-bean toppings, stir fries and omelettes make good dinners. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>How exercise can help</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>NICKI SAYS: </b>\"A new study has discovered that vigorous exercise can have a positive impact on the success rate of women trying to give up smoking. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"This is exciting news, especially when combined with previous research that shows exercising for one to two hours a week while quitting also significantly reduces the amount of weight gained. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"By incorporating exercise into your quitting programme, the feelgood endorphins your body produces also help you to overcome the mood swings that come with quitting.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nTips to give up smoking </h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b><br></br>Commit to daily exercise sessions during the first month of quitting. </b>Preferably in the morning to perk your mood up for the day ahead. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSign up to classes, if you can, to keep you on track and schedule in things like swimming and cycling. If you prefer, a fast 30-minute walk, skipping or working out to a DVD at home all count. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nExercise can help to relieve stress, making it the ideal antidote to tense moments during the day, which can otherwise leave you reaching for the ciggies. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Work out what your cigarette triggers are.</b> If you reach for one when you pick up the phone, walk up and down the stairs instead while chatting. Or if you can, go outside and talk while you walk. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIf your trigger is when you relax in front of the telly, stop watching and try skipping indoors or, again, go for a walk to distract you. Work out your own problem moments and plan ahead to avoid them by replacing them with something active. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Define your goals. </b>If you don't have a specific goal, your training will lack direction. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nTo help support your goals, look for programmes that match your needs. For example, if you're running a race to raise money for charity, most charities provide training programmes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nOr, try one of the many fitness apps  Nike Training Club, for instance, is free to download. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Keep a training diary. </b>Once you've worked out your training programme, it's important to keep a record of your workouts in a diary. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe easiest, quickest way to log details is to develop a code for the type and length of workout you do. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIt also means you can add up your total number of exercise minutes each week. Aim to increase what you do until you have reached four to six hours a week. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Stop boredom creeping in. </b>One of the biggest reasons we fall out of love with fitness is getting stuck in a rut. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nWhy not try inline skating or join a sports team? Aim to do at least two different types of cardiovascular exercise a week, whether it's running, cycling or swimming. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThis keeps your body challenged and mind engaged. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAny activity that focuses your mind will ensure you use your body more effectively so you'll get better results. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIdeal activities include martial arts such as t'ai chi, karate, capoeira or yoga and Pilates. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Get a big exercise high. </b>There's nothing like a high-intensity workout to give you an exercise high and get you wanting more. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nResearch shows intense bouts of exercise release more feelgood hormones and get you fitter quicker.

I don't remember her ever saying, \"Wouldn't you be pretty if you did this or that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe never focused on anything beyond wanting me to be presentable  just well-groomed.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe wanted me to take care of myself and be healthy. </p>\n<p>\nShe did ask one or two questions when I became a cheerleader at high school because I would be teasing my hair and wearing lipstick and eyeliner. </p>\n<p>\nI have an affiliation with a lot of countries. My mum was from Norway, my dad from Switzerland and my grandmother was Finnish, I have an Italian uncle, my first love was from South Africa and I was born in Texas.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am definitely a Texan girl. It is a culture you really love in a Latin sort of way. You taste it and hear it and the climate is hot  Texas hot.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI felt lucky that my parents were European  different  and opened the doors to let me see America is not the centre of the universe. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant that, with Bridget Jones, I could go to London and enjoy all things English that make the country so wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the making of the first film, I was even whistling songs by the Spice Girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my mum was a realist about bringing up a teenage girl in America and kept a sense of humour. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me that there are consequences for the things you say and do. She wanted me to grow up to be a good person. She and Dad liked simple and quiet. We had a very quiet house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mum didn't talk about her childhood growing up in Norway during the Second World War. Her sisters talked but all had difficulty in putting into words what they had seen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey told about women giving birth in tunnels because there was no safe haven in any other structure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd about being lost from family members and not being sure if they were alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it was different for me, from my friends, growing up in a house where your mother was grateful just to have peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was one thing which was never acceptable, though.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I said: \"I don't know how to do that\", she would say: \"Learn.\" </p>\n<p>\nShe encouraged me to get a college education (Renee has an English degree) as something to fall back on if acting didn't work out.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved to Los Angeles on December 6, 1993, to be exact.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy attitude was that I was going to see where it took me.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been working in Texas from the age of 21, and been in a couple of films. But I had pretty well exhausted my learning opportunities. </p>\n<p>\nSo I took a grungy little one-bed apartment and was scared to death of the future. It was a leap of faith, I guess. </p>\n<p>\nI had some friends in LA who I had met on films but inside and emotionally, I felt alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make a living, I worked in a bar called The Three Cubs on a street called Vine, behind the Mobil gas station.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was an incredible place for a girl like me, who had lived in relatively safe places all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were crack deals being done on the street corners  so I would come back from the bar late at night then not be able to get out of my car to my apartment until the deals were completed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked at the bar for two years. That was why Mum's guidance was so important and I stayed happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you can take care of yourself and see your friends, that is all that matters. </p>\n<p>\nThe main difference that the film Jerry Maguire made in my life was I could pay my rent and didn't have to waitress any more. It gave me freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew from the start that if I failed in acting, I always had my degree and could try a million things. I was not a \"look at me\" kind of girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had gravitated toward acting because I had a vivid imagination and daydreamed a lot. </p>\n<p>\nBut I did not daydream about being on a film set, winning an Oscar or having people know my name.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for the fact my mum never worried that I would compromise myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was always telling me, 'You don't sit down enough'  but she learned to trust my instincts.\n</p>","timestamp":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"ACTRESS Renee Zellweger reveals how her Norwegian mother influenced her career","headline":"Renee's European parents","section":"woman","id":4203467,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4203467/Renee-Zellweger-America-is-not-the-centre-of-the-universe.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01473/Renee_Zellweger--5_1473337a.jpg","subdeck":"Different perspective ...

He's embarrassed her and he's got no right to put her in this position. </p>\n<p>\n\"He should literally find a hole and hide in it for the next week. It really, really annoys me. It's like, 'Who do you think you are?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStressing his support for N-Dubz singer Tulisa, Simon went on: \"It makes no difference with me about her coming back on the show  100 per cent. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I mean, God, if I said no (to her coming back) it's allowing every sleazebag in the country to wreck somebody's career when she didn't do something wrong. </p>\n<p>\n\"The public are very, very a) forgiving, and b) understanding. But I hope they don't forgive the person who did it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSimon said all four of last year's X Factor judges  Tulisa, Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Kelly Rowland  were set to return. The Sun has already revealed that Gary will be back. </p>\n<p>\nDespite Simon's backing, the leaked video scandal showed no signs of easing up last night. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe man Tulisa says appears in the video  Justin Edwards  has made a series of claims about the origin of the six-minute film. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun can reveal that he told the X Factor judge's lawyers last October that he didn't have a copy of it. </p>\n<p>\nTulisa, who is said to be \"completely devastated\" by the leak, set the law firm on Edwards  known as MC Ultra  after apparently learning about the online leaks. </p>\n<p>\nIn response, he stated that he had \"no knowledge whatsoever of any tape\" and didn't have \"a tape such as you referred to at all\". </p>\n<p>\nHe added in his response to the lawyers: \"Even if I did which I do not, I would have no desire to publish them, simply because I would find that ungentlemanly. I was brought up better than that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRapper Edwards made the denial just weeks after an unknown man showed The Sun images of a woman performing a sex act. He claimed the woman was Tulisa. </p>\n<p>\nYesterday, after Tulisa claimed in a YouTube video that HE had leaked the camera-phone footage</a>, Edwards said on Twitter: \"To find the truth both sides of the story should be heard.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTulisa had initially denied she was in the video. But after a website this week started charging for downloads, her lawyers raced to London's High Court to have it taken offline. </p>\n<p>\nAnd on Wednesday night Tulisa admitted she WAS the woman in the film. </p>\n<p>\nThe singer  poised to launch a solo career  said on YouTube: \"When you share an intimate moment with someone you love, you never imagine that at any point it will be shared with people around the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's a pretty tough time for me, but I don't feel I should take the heat for it.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nc.robertson@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By COLIN ROBERTSON, TV Editor, and GARY O&rsquo;SHEA","teaser":"MUSIC guru Simon Cowell stands by Tulisa Contostavlos over her sex tape scandal","headline":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job","section":"tv","id":4212851,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNN2301TULI--53202_1476168a.jpg","subdeck":"X-rated video ... talent show judge Tulisa Contostavlos","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":true},{"isTop":0,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Simon Cowell ...

My flatmates had no idea and it has kind of opened this whole web of lies. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have realised that I am actually quite a good liar, which is terrifying actually. I'm beyond excited  I want to get started already.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSpeculation about who would take over as the Time Lord's assistant has been rife since Karen Gillan  who has played Amy Pond for the past two series  announced her departure in December</a>. </p>\n<p>\nShe will leave in the fifth episode of the series, which is due to screen on BBC1 in the autumn. </p>\n<p>\nBut fans will have to wait until the show's Christmas special for the introduction of the new character. </p>\n<p>\nThe 25 year old  who played Emmerdale lesbian Jasmine Thomas until 2009  won the role after wowing bosses with her screen test and her chemistry with Time Lord Matt Smith. </p>\n<p>\nBut show boss Steven Moffat has so far refused to reveal the name of the character that she will play. He said: \"Who she's playing, how the Doctor meets her and even where he finds her are all part of one of the biggest mysteries the Time Lord has ever encountered. Even by the Doctor's standards, this isn't your usual boy meet girl.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOf Amy Pond's exit, he said: \"It will be a final encounter with the angels and not everybody gets out alive  and I really mean it this time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJenna-Louise  a long-time fan of the show  admitted that former Time Lord David Tennant and his sidekick Billie Piper were her favourite pairing. </p>\n<p>\nBut she described her new co-star Matt Smith as \"amazing\" and \"very supportive\". </p>\n<p>\nAnd Moffat said Jenna-Louise  who also stars in ITV1's Titanic series which starts on Sunday  was the only person he has met who can keep up with Matt's pace. </p>\n<p>\nHe also revealed: \"There was a moment I remember when they were auditioning together and they both looked frightened doing a Doctor Who scene. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was an instant poster and I thought, 'God that's brilliant'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJenna-Louise found out that she had landed the job while in a Marks &amp; Spencer store buying food. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was debating what goes best in a salmon salad and I got a call from my agent. </p>\n<p>\n\"I thought, 'I can't carry on shopping now.'

The final investment decision was taken last week.

Sir Andrew added: \"At 10am six teenagers rode up on their bikes and asked to put their names down for jobs at the new factory  it was brilliant.

But with a flat-rate cakeage levy of &#163;15 for parties of two to five, then &#163;3 a head for bigger groups, there's nothing traditional about the bill. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MAZE GRILL - <i>Gordon Ramsay (&#163;5 'cakeage' per person)</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCELEBRITY chef Ramsay is as famous for his effing and blinding as his nosh. </p>\n<p>\nBut customers may well be letting fly a few tasty expletives of their own if they take a birthday cake along to his grillhouse in London's posh Mayfair. </p>\n<p>\nTalk about Hell's Kitchen! </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>RHODES 24 - <i>Gary Rhodes (&#163;9.45 'cakeage' per person)</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>\nRHODES may not be getting as many TV gigs as Jamie Oliver  but at least he's raking it in on cakeage. </p>\n<p>\nHis Michelin-starred diner on the 24th floor of one of London's tallest buildings, Tower 42, offers diners views across the City. </p>\n<p>\nThe gaff is not all that's sky-high, though. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>NOBU - <i>Robert de Niro (&#163;5 'cakeage' per person)</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>\nANOTHER posh Mayfair eaterie, this one is co-owned by Taxi Driver movie legend Robert De Niro. </p>\n<p>\nThere are also outlets in Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Dubai. </p>\n<p>\nBut some punters won't be able to afford a taxi home after coughing up for their bill. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE FAT DUCK - <i>Heston Blumenthal (up to &#163;25 'cakeage' per person!)</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>\nFAMED as one of Britain's finest dining experiences, with three Michelin stars, Blumenthal's pride and joy is pretty pricey  a set menu is &#163;180 per head. </p>\n<p>\nSo perhaps no surprise that The Fat Duck, in Bray, Berks, is worst offender in our cakeage hall of shame. </p>\n<p>\nA flat rate of &#163;50 for two to four people, rising to &#163;70 if there are five or six, seems totally quackers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Elsewhere </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>THE charges above may seem incredible but at least you can bring your own cake. </p>\n<p>\nAt celebrity eaterie The Ivy, where the likes of X Factor boss Simon Cowell often eats, they point-blank refuse to let you in with a cake, citing health and safety. </p>\n<p>\nBut High Street favourites such as Pizza Express and Cafe Rouge have no such objection  staff laughed when we asked if they levied for cakeage.
