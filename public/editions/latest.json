I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b><a href=\"mailto:d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

It followed her own near-death experience when she gave birth to new daughter Hollie. </p>\n<p>\nBut show insiders last night insisted Amanda meant no offence to the Delilah singer, adding: \"She has the utmost respect for Tom.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA fierce spat erupted between the rival show's stars before they clash in a ratings war tonight. </p>\n<p>\nAmanda, 41, joins boss Cowell and fellow judges Alesha Dixon and David Walliams on the ITV1 show. </p>\n<p>\nLast night Cowell  who had been criticised by Sir Tom over his right to judge singers  hit back at the Welsh crooner's ability to pick wannabe stars. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Most artists who try and run record labels fail. That's why they are artists. Can a singer judge another singer as well as a record executive?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe music tycoon also blasted \"petty\" Beeb bosses over the scheduling clash, laying the blame firmly at their door. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They're the ones who seem to be making it into a battle. We were always going to air in March because of my timings. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"The BBC are doing this as the more they talk about us the more headlines they get. But I don't like it when the shows clashes. It is petty scheduling.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut BBC1 controller Danny Cohen played down the battle for viewers, saying: \"I'm not going to put a number on what we see as success for The Voice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday Cowell said this year's BGT will be the best ever, erasing memories of last year's uninspiring run. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"There's a mixture of good and what I call good old-fashioned British eccentricity. </p>\n<p>\n\"The best way to judge the show is not to take it too seriously, but the good ones are always going to get through and that is the important thing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>With a glint in his eye, he added: \"There will be some strippers of course  one or two.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he said there will be nine acts in the semi-final instead of eight, ensuring even more talent gets through. </p>\n<p>\nSimon, 52, also sang the praises of Walliams, 40  who rose to fame alongside Matt Lucas in BBC1 comedy Little Britain. Cowell said: \"I've been trying to get David to do this show for the past two years. There were these two bellringers last year and I texted him saying: 'It's you and Matt!'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Some of his characters on Little Britain are like some of our contestants.

The world is so full of entertainment now, isn't it? So there are a lot of nerves. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's amazing to be back in music. I like the intimacy of a recording studio and song-writing. I'm using a different part of my brain when I work on music versus when I'm directing a film. </p>\n<p>\n\"There are a billion more people on a film and I don't have that visceral outlet of being able to sing, scream... jump around. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's very different. I love doing both but it was nice to have the simplicity of song-writing after three years of writing a script and directing and editing and talking about my film, to sit down and play my guitar and sing a song. I almost cried.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHer last studio album, Hard Candy in May 2008, experimented with a hip-hop influence. She collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and Timbaland. </p>\n<p>\nThe album reached No1 around the world but received a lukewarm reception from some fans and critics. </p>\n<p>\nMDNA, a \"triple entendre\" as she describes it, is a return to what she does best: classic pop songs with a sprinkling of trademark controversy. </p>\n<p>\n<i>And it is down to the return of her winning formula: working with top European producers.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nStuart Price produced some of her best original material on Confessions On A Dancefloor back in 2005. She also made some great material with French electronic guru Mirwais. </p>\n<p>\nBut her return to the studio with producer William Orbit, who made Ray Of Light back in 1998, is a master stroke. </p>\n<p>\nThe tracks they have made together on the new album, including Gang Bang and Some Girls, slot into her discography perfectly. </p>\n<p>\nShe has also employed the skills of Martin Solveig, Italian DJ Benny Benassi and his cousin Allessandro. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Madonna believes her return to Europe for her producing partners is no coincidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I think maybe I just have more of a European sensibility. People say that about my songs as well. I like working with people who are well-read and know what's going on in the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"Conversation is essential. With William, we always get into discussions about philosophy or quantum physics. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"With Martin Solveig we always end up getting in to discussions about foreign films. When I'm working with people I can't just write music, I have to be able to talk about life and the world, and art. Benny was a tricky one because he doesn't speak English very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was a little bit frustrating at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they're not. </p>\n<p>\n\"When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"Martin is such good fun, I adore him. You have to feel like you can say 'No, I don't like that,' and you're not going to hurt their feelings. And vice versa. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he's got just the right balance of seriousness and humour. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe production on the album is slick, with some great touches. </p>\n<p>\nOn Gang Bang the noise of a spent cartridge from a gun hitting a concrete floor illustrates her \"Kill Bill\" fantasy for the track. </p>\n<p>\nBut the contrast of a huge pop track like Superstar, featuring her daughter Lourdes on backing vocals, is followed up with a song called Falling Free  one of her most stripped-back songs for years. She explained: \"I have to be completely involved in the production. I like the contrast. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to have something that is just slammed with noise and sound and bass and drum, sensory overload and then create something like Falling Free, which is stripped back and all you can really hear is my voice and the lyrics. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes I sit down on a guitar and start strumming chords and things come out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes people bring a song to me that has a title, for instance, or an idea of a lyric and I take it and kind of re-shape it, re-word it and make it my own. It comes in so many different ways, it's always been that way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe album features some big collaborations with strong female solo stars  M.I.A and rapper Nicki Minaj. Give Me All Your Luvin' was the Superbowl song that ended up causing controversy when M.I.A decided to stick up her middle fin ger. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But that punk spirit is exactly why she got them on board.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was looking to collaborate with women who I think have a strong sense of themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were a lot of fun to be around in the studio, for sure. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think we were all shy of each other in the beginning, that's just human nature. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think we got over that pretty quickly. </p>\n<p>\n\"They're both very self-possessed people, especially M.I.A. I don't think she's impressed much by stars and celebrities, so we just got down to business. I loved her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the key to keeping the music original? Don't listen to chart music while you are writing. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I wasn't listening to anything to tell you the truth, when I wrote this. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was working on the soundtrack to my movie W.E. So just classical music. I actually don't like listening to pop music while I'm working on pop music  it doesn't really work. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"You don't want to hear other people's stuff, you need a clean slate to work off.\"</i>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 01:34:00 +0000","teaser":"TIME is precious for the mum of four  she has an album and tour to finish","headline":"Madonna: I like to work with people who talk about philosophy or quantum physics","section":"showbiz","id":4213093,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/sftw/4213093/Madonna-I-like-to-work-with-people-who-can-talk-about-philosophy-or-quantum-physics.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/madonna2-532_1476109a.jpg","subdeck":"Intelligent conversation ...

We saw his horrifically burned body and we cannot get that image out of our minds.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMedical student Mundill Mahil, 20, was jailed last month for six years for GBH with intent. Harvinder Shoker, also 20, got life for murder, while 20-year-old Darren Peters was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Amandip and her mum Tajinder have asked the Attorney General to review the sentence handed to Mahil and set up an e-petition, Justice For Gagandip. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking out for the first time, Amandip added: \"He would not have been murdered if Mundill Mahil hadn't lured him to her flat in Brighton in a carefully orchestrated honeytrap. </p>\n<p>\n\"Mahil will be released for good behaviour in three years. It's outrageous. Other cases involving money and fraud get much more punishment. Gagandip's life has been taken. I believe something more needs to be done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip's body was found in the burning car in Blackheath, south-east London, in February last year. </p>\n<p>\nHe had been violently attacked in Brighton before being driven back to the capital and murdered. </p>\n<p>\n<i>A post-mortem examination revealed he was still alive when the fire in the car was started.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the second tragedy for the family in just 18 months. In September 2009 Gagandip's father Charanjit was murdered in India. Eight people are on trial there accused of being involved. </p>\n<p>\nGagandip took over his dad's packaging firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"We were only just starting to come to terms with the first murder when Gagan was killed. It has knocked the life out of me and Mum.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard that Mahil, from Chatham, Kent, had been Gagandip's girlfriend. He was in love but they split up in August 2010 after she alleged he had sexually assaulted her. </p>\n<p>\nShoker, his friend of five years, also fell in love with Mahil and decided to take revenge on the businessman. </p>\n<p>\nIn February last year she lured Gagandip to her house in Brighton. </p>\n<p>\nShe knew that Shoker and Peters, both from London, would be lying in wait for him. </p>\n<p>\nHe was beaten unconscious and bundled into the boot of the car. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"I only met Mahil once, when Gagandip brought her to our home. She was very pretty and confident and seemed a nice person. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My brother and I were very close and were both living at home and saw each other every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"He became very close to her and said she was a friend he trusted and who he could talk to about anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Look at how she betrayed his trust. She tried to destroy my brother's character in court. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he was a kind, generous man who would have done anything to help anyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDetective Superintendent Damian Allain, who investigated the case, said after the conviction: \"Throughout the investigation and trial Mahil portrayed herself as a victim. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is clear to me, now endorsed by the jury's verdict, that her actions were calculating and that she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy with Shoker and Peters of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which resulted in his death.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family say Gagandip had the world at his feet. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"He ran the family's successful employment agency and packaging business. He also set up and headed Sikh TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"In addition, he was the founder of the British Sikh Student Federation. He had made friends and contacts all around the world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHis mother Tajinder, 45, was equally proud of his achievements. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"He had done so much. I didn't think a 21-year-old would be capable of so much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm amazed how much he achieved. Never a day goes by when we don't think about him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am devastated by my son's killing and struggling to cope. In my life there's only a dead end. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There's nothing left ahead. The whole story has finished here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe now runs the family business, which employs 300 people. But with the emotional turmoil of losing her son she found it almost impossible to carry on with it. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"When I first learned of Gagandip's death I was completely and utterly broken. </p>\n<p>\n\"I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on. I do not have the support of a husband because he also died not so long before Gagan. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I cannot describe on an average day my life since Gagandip's death because they have all blended into one. </p>\n<p>\n\"In the early stages I couldn't hold a conversation without breaking down in tears and there were occasions when the police had to call an ambulance for me after I collapsed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCherished pictures from the family photo album show what a loving son and brother Gagandip was. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a picture of him at his 21st birthday party with killer Shoker. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Shoker turned up uninvited to the party. </p>\n<p>\n\"We knew things weren't right between Gagandip and Shoker by that stage. The photo of them together is so ironic as they look like the best of friends  and for over five years they were. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sickened by the thought that the man who holds his hand lovingly over my brother's heart in the photo is the same person who later beat him so terribly then burned him alive. </p>\n<p>\n\"He spent so much time around at our house that he practically lived here. </p>\n<p>\n\"What he did is such a terrible betrayal of trust.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip was cremated and his ashes scattered in a river at the Kiratpur Sahib temple in the Punjab, India. </p>\n<p>\nLike her mother, Amandip broke down when she remembered the precious times they had together. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I found it hard to go into his bedroom without getting very upset.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, though, they remember him with the shrine in the garden and in his former bedroom in south east London. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Mum and I actually slept in his room as a way of trying to feel closer to him. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now we have turned his bedroom into a shrine, with a large photo of him on the bed and all his clothes and possessions are still in the room.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Gagandip's mum and sister are still clearly in pain over his loss  but their grief would be easier to bear if they felt justice had been done.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional reporting: MARK CHRISTY</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By GRANT ROLLINGS","teaser":"DISTRAUGHT sister's fury at six-year sentence for 20-year-old honeytrapper Mundill Mahil","headline":"Honeytrapper could be free in 3yrs","section":"woman","id":4215414,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4215414/Girl-who-lured-my-brother-to-his-death-could-be-free-in-three-years.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF24hon5n---532_1476721a.jpg","subdeck":"Honeytrapper ...

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'.

Sometimes they literally just faint. But occasionally, they have a cardiac arrest.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs one of a few doctors there when I joined the Lords 17 years ago, I was appalled how poor were the arrangements for these sudden, terrifying emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe attendant staff had often been trained in mouth-to-mouth and cardiac resuscitation, but there was no defibrillator anywhere in Parliament. This piece of kit is a life-saver.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen its electrodes are applied across the chest, its sudden pulse of high voltage electricity can jolt the heart back into a normal rhythmic beat. It's a clever device because its detector only allows an electric shock if the collapsed patient has had a cardiac arrest or a fatal change of heart rhythm.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it is safe and exceptionally easy to use by any layman with minimal training.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet when I tried to persuade the authorities in Parliament to obtain one of these portable machines (they are not expensive) officials in both Houses refused. Their excuses were shameful.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne official argued that we could not have a defibrillator as it would cause a problem if a tourist collapsed in the gallery  should we be obliged to offer resuscitation to a member of the public? It was suggested there might be legal consequences if it were used or not used. Four years later, an elderly peer collapsed right after speaking. There were no doctors present in the chamber and he died.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly then, reluctantly, was a defibrillator installed, and since then at least two lives have been saved. Cardiac arrest is extremely common yet it can be correctable. Clearly, it would help if everybody were trained in external cardiac massage, for example in schools. This knowledge would save some lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a clever defibrillator is a different matter. It is astonishing that so many public buildings do not have them readily available.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Those first few seconds after a cardiac emergency are critical and we must be prepared.\n</i></p>\n<p>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.bhf.org.uk/get-involved/campaigning/emergency-life-saving-skills.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">To sign The Sun-backed British Heart Foundation petition, click here</a></b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"LORD Robert Winston backs Sun campaign for CPR to be taught in British schools","headline":"CPR helped me save lives.

Girls assume she is a porn star. Then there's the back pain. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Lots of women want big boobs but it's actually a total nightmare. </p>\n<p>\n\"The only men I attract are the sleazy type. It's rare that a guy looks me in the face when talking to me. </p>\n<p>\n\"Guys will flat-out stare and try all the cheesy chat-up lines. And a lot of the time they want their picture taken with them. Not me  <i>them</i>.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"Sometimes it can be a bit scary. A few blokes will try to get really hands-on. When I'm out with my male friends they'll usually circle round me. They're my bodyguards.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't fare much better with other girls. She says: \"Women assume my boobs are fake  they look at me like I'm a porn star. It's older women who always comment on them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They'll tut and shake their heads as they walk past me in the street. I can hear them saying, 'They're so fake', and, 'Look at her flaunting them'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I try to smile through it. I know they're real but sometimes it can be hurtful. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've developed a way of walking so my boobs bounce up and down and people can see they're real. It looks like I'm walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\n\"Women can get quite jealous  that's probably why I have more male friends.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut meeting the right guy is difficult. Glasgow girl Stephanie says: \"I broke up with my ex in 2010. He couldn't handle all the attention I get and became insanely jealous. </p>\n<p>\n\"When we were out he'd get mad when other guys checked me out. I tried telling him it couldn't be helped  he knew what he was getting into.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie has seen a few men since the split but no one special has caught her eye. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They become too obsessed with my boobs, it's all they think about. It's hard to find a guy to see past them. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of blokes are just after me for the status of it, they see it as just another notch on the bedpost. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I want my boyfriend to see me for me, I'm more than just a pair of boobs. I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half  but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs  though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that  it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b><a href=\"mailto:a.jones@the-sun.co.uk\">a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By AMY JONES","teaser":"STEPHANIE'S back-breaking, all-natural boobs are subject of daily abuse from strangers","headline":"My natural 32K boobs are a nightmare...only sleazy blokes chat me up while girls tut and assume I'm a porn star","section":"woman","id":4212810,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212810/My-natural-32K-boobs-are-a-nightmare.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2330a---532_1476242a.jpg","subdeck":"'I have a walk to make them bounce to show they're real' ...

I don't reflect on such things easily because I've never been an emotional person. I'm logic personified. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back over my life, I tried to work out how and where the desire for independence began to make itself felt. </p>\n<p>\nAmong my earliest memories was when I was three and my mum Rita and nan Nina left me at home one day with my grandfather, Gerald, while they went shopping. </p>\n<p>\nI remember my mum and dad, Terry, had this elegant drinks cabinet in the lounge. As a toddler I was fascinated by it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe door folded down and all these beautiful little glasses and different-coloured bottles glinted away in the backlight. </p>\n<p>\nI decided to get a chair, climb up and have a good look. Everything looked even better close up. </p>\n<p>\nThe dainty little glasses (for sherry), the perfect size for me, were so tempting that I started to fill them with the green, yellow and clear liquids I saw in the bottles  cr&#232;me de menthe, advocaat and vodka. </p>\n<p>\nTaking little sips and inviting my dolls to do the same, I was having a wonderful time  until my grandfather came into the room and asked what I was doing. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, as soon as he twigged, he told me to stop. Three-year-old me instantly replied: \"This is my house and I'll do as I want.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe left me to it. He was married to my grandmother, so perhaps he knew not to pick a losing fight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Not surprisingly, when my mum and nan got home I was rolling drunk and, by all accounts, not much more co-operative.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather got an earful, I was put to bed and the story passed into family lore. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs my nan used to tell me: \"You were such a little cow  and you know what? You weren't sick, not once. Not a drop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got that streak in you as a toddler, no one's ever going to be able to tell you what to do when you're fully grown. </p>\n<p>\n<i>It wasn't a one-off, either.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA few months later my mum took me to school for the very first time. </p>\n<p>\nPicking me up after my first day, she asked the teacher how I had got on. She had been worried, my mum admitted, because I was very shy. </p>\n<p>\n\"Which one is your daughter?\" the teacher asked. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady,\" said my mother. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady?\" was the incredulous response. \"Shy? She walked in, pulled a boy off his chair and said, 'That's my seat. Move.' I wouldn't be worried if I was you!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was advice my mother took to heart. In fact, that was probably the last time she worried about me. </p>\n<p>\nThere were other powerful influences in my childhood. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of my grandmothers were hard workers, strong women and very important in moulding me. </p>\n<p>\nI was very close to Nina, my mother's mother, in particular, who put an end to that alcoholic tea party when I was three. She was dynamite. She was Italian  from Naples  and incredibly feisty. She would have killed for her family  she wouldn't have thought twice about it. </p>\n<p>\nIf someone cut up my grandfather in traffic, she would get out of the car and punch them on the nose. </p>\n<p>\nI'm sure it won't come as any surprise when I say she was definitely the one in control of her house and marriage. </p>\n<p>\nShe was great with money  not because she had a lot but because she knew the price of everything and she was in charge. </p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather went out to work as a postman but she would take his wages and give him cash to spend. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThat was just the way it was. Grandma Nina really believed in me. Her attitude was: You can do it, so go out there and get on with it. </p>\n<p>\nEven if I get a bit feisty at home now, my husband will still say to me, \"Oh, Nina's here. Nina's coming out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>I was fiercely determined. If I wanted something and my parents wouldn't give it to me, I would find a way to get it for myself.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI was never given pocket money. My parents always offered to buy me what I wanted but I wanted to be in charge of my own money. </p>\n<p>\nI recall them once saying no to something  I can't remember what it was  but I haven't forgotten what I decided to do. I put up signs in my bedroom window  it was my bedroom so I could do what I liked, I reasoned  saying, \"Massages, manicures, come inside!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mother was shouting up: \"Who are all these weirdos coming to the door?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I bawled back: \"They're my customers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI was bloody-minded too. I once put up a Vote Labour poster in my bedroom just because my parents were Conservatives. </p>\n<p>\nMy dad roared: \"Take that down!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"It's my bedroom!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"What does the poster even mean?\" And I didn't know, of course. I just knew it would wind him up and cause a debate. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 14, I'd tell my mum I was going to stay the night with my best friend, Charlotte, who would tell her mum she was staying at my house. </p>\n<p>\nAfter that we would meet up with our clothes in carrier bags, get changed, take the Tube into central London then go out in Soho. </p>\n<p>\nWhen everything closed we'd walk around until the Tube re-started in the early morning and go back to our borough  Enfield in north London. </p>\n<p>\nThen we walked around until 10am before we went home. </p>\n<p>\nMum would say, \"Well, you look very tired.\" But she never knew. Years later, when I told her, she was shocked. But I was even more shocked by what she said to me. </p>\n<p>\nShe looked at my daughter Sophie and said: \"What goes around, comes around.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI went very cold and felt terrible about what I had done. </p>\n<p>\nBut at the time I couldn't have cared less. </p>\n<p>\nNothing was going to happen to me. I was in control, I was safe  or at least I thought I was. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But if I imagine my 15-year-old Sophie going out all night now, well...</i> </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nThe day I made a name for myself </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nMY school had lots of careers days and companies came in and talked to us, including advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the London radio station LBC. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLots of people were interested but whereas everybody thought maybe they'd write to them, I got all the right details before the people left. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe next day I was on the phone making appointments. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoth companies I was interested in offered me a job. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI chose Saatchi, leaving school on the Friday and starting work there the following Monday. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I was only 18, they put me on their graduate programme. I suppose they saw something in me. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I loved it, the programme was very rigid, so finally I got impatient and moved instead to LBC as a 19-year-old selling radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been given Asian Hour to sell, which was pretty tough  a 4am to 5am slot, the real graveyard shift. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been handed a list of companies that spent money on advertising but who didn't advertise on radio. One was Sport Newspapers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI got through to owner David Sullivan on the phone and he wasn't interested, saying \"radio didn't work\". </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI decided I would drop off some material at his office  persistence is everything  and once I was there I decided to wait to meet him in person. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI waited and waited and waited and in the end he agreed to see me because I had waited so long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI did a very quick pitch to him and he wasn't buying it at all, so I said: \"Look, if you take the advertising and sales don't go up, you don't have to pay for it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"That sounds good to me.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI didn't have the authority to do a deal like that, so it was a risk  but I remember thinking, \"Well, if it doesn't work out, what's the worst that can happen? They can fire me but I can always get another job. I'm only 19.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI still use that kind of thinking and I have done all my life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact, it's the foundation of my confidence and my ability to take risks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt worked out. Sales went up and, within months, Sullivan was spending more than &#163;2million a year on radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI was managing it all and earning more commission than all the other sales staff put together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen he offered me a job, which I accepted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat episode is often considered to have been a turning point in my professional life but, in truth, I think my life had been heading that way since I was a young child. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Adapted by BEN JACKSON</b> <b>Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, by Karren Brady, is published by HarperCollins on March 29, &#163;18.99.</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"FUNNY anecdotes from the Apprentice star and West Ham vice-chairman's new book","headline":"Brady: I told Grandad, I'll do what I like","section":"woman","id":4212917,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212917/Karren-Brady-Sipping-vodka-aged-3-I-told-Grandad-Ill-do-what-I-like.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf23bran1--532_1476008a.jpg","subdeck":"Driven ...

As far back as 1877 a statue of Venus de Milo was the subject of a court case when a gardener was caught trying to have sex with \"her\". </p>\n<p>\nMore recently, American Edward Smith has expressed his love for his VW Beetle, Vanilla, though he admits having \"relationships\" with many vehicles. </p>\n<p>\nHis most intense sexual experience was \"making love\" to a helicopter from the Eighties TV series Airwolf  but his major love is cars. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEdward said: \"I go a little bit beyond appreciating the beauty of a car, to the point of what I feel is an expression of love. </p>\n<p>\n\"I write poetry about cars, I sing to them and talk to them like a girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not sick. Cars are just my preference.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe told earlier this month how Leeds shop assistant Amanda Whittaker, 27, has fallen for the Statue of Liberty, or \"Libby\" as she knows her. At school she loved a drum kit. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1979, Eija-Riitta Ekl&#246;f from Sweden \"married\" the Berlin Wall. Eija, who changed her surname to Berliner-Mauer, coined the term Objectum Sexual (OS) for her unconventional orientation. </p>\n<p>\nMrs Berliner-Mauer says her \"long-distance\" relationship survived the \"tragedy\" of the wall being pulled down in 1989  but she has fallen for a red fence. Former US soldier Erika LaBrie, 41, pledged to love, honour and obey the Eiffel Tower in an intimate ceremony in Paris in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nErika Eiffel founded the Objectum Sexuality Internationale group which has more than 40 members and a website. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOther \"inanimate lovers\" revealed by objectophiles include a cartoon character, steam locomotives, words, public buildings and a hydraulic flood barrier. </p>\n<p>\nSan Francisco sexologist Dr Amy Marsh carried out a scientific survey involving 21 objectophiles and found cars, trains and aircraft are the most common objects of desire. </p>\n<p>\nBut more women than men are objectophiles and they are more likely to love structures. </p>\n<p>\nDr Marsh said: \"OS transcends fetishism and is experienced as a sexual and/ or affectionate orientation with an array of emotions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It does not seem to be caused by trauma or delusional psychiatric conditions, though it does seem linked with autism. </p>\n<p>\n\"Professionals need to learn more about OS and treat OS patients with the same respect they do for other sexual preference minorities.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information go to <a href=\"http://dramymarshsexologist.com\" target=\"_blank\">dramymarshsexologist.com</a>. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<a href=\"http://m.phillips@the-sun.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">m.phillips@the-sun.co.uk </a><a href=\"http://m.phillips@the-sun.co.uk\"> </a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:01:00 +0000","byline":"By MARTIN PHILLIPS, Senior Feature Writer","teaser":"MEET the 'objectophiles'  a growing number of people who are attracted to objects","headline":"The best sex of my life?","section":"woman","id":4212923,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212923/Meet-the-people-attracted-to-objects.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2322gn-5323_1476064a.jpg","subdeck":"Flight of fancy ...

I blamed the bad smells on the dog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nConstantly banning herself from the food she loves has made Alison's adult life a misery. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My hatred of being big has meant I have spent every day on a dieting roller coaster. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a fad diet junkie. It has become an addiction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Alison's first diet memory goes back to when she was just 13. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll never forget the anxiety I felt when a shop girl told my mum there wasn't a school dress big enough for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I squeezed into the size they had and trundled off to secondary school tugging at the hemline in embarrassment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter being called \"fatty\" in that first year at school, Alison embarked on her first diet. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum had the Scarsdale Diet book and for six weeks I had grapefruit for breakfast, protein and salad for lunch and protein and veg for tea. </p>\n<p>\n\"Although I was always starving and grumpy, I stuck to it and lost a stone over the summer holidays and hit my goal weight of 8st. </p>\n<p>\n\"Even though I wasn't as skinny as some of my friends, I was just so happy to have been accepted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as soon as Alison stopped the diet plan, she shot back up to 9st, large for her 5ft 6in frame. </p>\n<p>\nSo she was actually <b>HAPPY</b> when she contracted glandular fever at the age of 16. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost a stone effortlessly  I was thrilled. I battled to stay that size but the weight I'd lost on the 'Glandular Fever Diet' didn't stay off. </p>\n<p>\n\"As soon as the biscuit barrel was in sight, I piled on the weight.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison's obsession got worse when she found even quicker fixes. Within six months of turning 19, she had tried the Fit For Life Diet, the Egg And Grapefruit Diet and the Banana Diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I even tried the Lunch Box Diet. The idea is that you fill a lunch box up with lots of healthy food. That was great... until I started replacing the salad with chocolate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring her twenties, Alison's weight fluctuated between a healthy 9½st and 10st  but she longed to be a stone lighter again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA turning point in her dieting nightmare came when she married Frank, a photographer, now 48, in 1988 when she was 22. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost half a stone through a combination of nerves and WeightWatchers but, again, it didn't stay off. Within a year, I'd gone to almost 11st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison got desperate and started the meal replacement Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Within two months I was down to 8½st but, boy, it was hard. It was worth it though. I was slim and loving it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYo-yo dieting her way through the Eighties, Alison would spend hours researching gimmicks to keep herself below 10st  until she became pregnant for the first time in 1991. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I embraced eating for two and indulged in whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I looked massive. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was more than 14st when I gave birth to Charlie, who is now 20.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Afterwards, Alison got straight back into her fad diet cycle and spent a fortune on books and consultations to get back down to her beloved 9st. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she explains: \"Just as I hit the 10st mark, I found out I was pregnant with baby No2. </p>\n<p>\n\"Again, I ate for Britain. This time I was 13½st when I gave birth to Olivia in 1995.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce more, Alison threw herself into a host of different diets. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"You name it, I tried it. I'd feel motivated at the beginning and lose a few pounds but then I'd have a blip and pig out for a few days before embarking on another 'new' diet, telling myself this would be 'the one'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison did not manage to slim down before becoming pregnant again in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nThe cycle of gorging and dieting continued after daughter Florence was born in 2001, and Alison flitted between 11 and 12½st. </p>\n<p>\nTwo years ago, Alison's husband told her he was worried because her stomach was bigger than her bust. </p>\n<p>\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan had worked for her in the past and, amazingly, she lost three-and-a-half stone in just three months. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"At last I was 10st again. I stayed at that weight for six months by cutting out carbs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I looked great but missed bread and pasta.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut gradually the carbs slipped back on to her plate and Alison now admits: \"I'm back to 12st... oh all right, 12½st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hate being this big but I can't face another liquid replacement diet  unless the liquid is Sauvignon Blanc. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Most of all, I'm sick of knowing that if I could just eat less and exercise more, my weight would naturally decrease. Perhaps then I would finally be happy.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nALISON'S DIETS </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n1. The Scarsdale </p>\n<p>\n2.

Sian, 20, who lives with her parents in Welwyn, Kent, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdam was such a fit young man that even now it's hard to accept he died so suddenly. </p>\n<p>\nWe were enjoying a family holiday in Cyprus. Just minutes before he died, Adam had been laughing and playing water volleyball. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then he said he felt unwell. He got out and sat on the side of the pool  before suddenly collapsing head first into the water. </p>\n<p>\nMy parents and I had gone for a walk and a friend of Adam's dashed to find us. By the time we got back, Adam had been pulled out of the pool. </p>\n<p>\nAn ambulance was on its way and a nurse was desperately giving him the kiss of life, trying to restart his heart. </p>\n<p>\nNow we know Adam had had a cardiac arrest. Tragically, it was too late to save him. </p>\n<p>\nTwo post-mortems  one in Cyprus and one in the UK  confirmed he died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nFor years we believed it was something peculiar to Adam. Then two years ago Cry, The Sudden Death Charity, suggested the family should all be screened. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum Julie, 50, had heart checks first  and, astoundingly, was diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nCommonly associated with Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, it is an inherited condition that affects the heart's rhythm. A year later I too was diagnosed with it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a shock to realise this syndrome was undoubtedly responsible for Adam's death in 2004 and the deaths of many other young people. </p>\n<p>\nWe then discovered it can be picked up by a simple ECG. Had Adam been tested his death could have been prevented. </p>\n<p>\nIn July 2010 I had a mini defibrillator fitted. </p>\n<p>\nIt is terrible to think Adam's death has probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\nThat's why I believe everyone should undergo a routine heart trace at 14. If an irregular heartbeat is detected, doctors can investigate further. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nNick Dias </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ASSISTANT site manager Nick collapsed in December and has now been fitted with a pacemaker. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The 27-year-old lives with fianc&#233;e Lynsey, 25, and their children, Brooke, five, and Riley, seven months, in Radlett, Herts. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a non-smoker, who is slim and exercises regularly, I never imagined I would have a heart problem. </p>\n<p>\nBut in December last year Lynsey and I were walking Brooke to school and after bending down to get her schoolbag from Riley's pushchair I passed out. </p>\n<p>\nSeconds later I came round to find Lynsey looking very concerned. Apparently I'd fallen backwards and cracked my head on the pavement. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe assumed I'd fainted and carried on walking Brooke to school. But as we did so, Lynsey became more worried because I started talking gibberish  I kept repeating myself and asking strange questions. </p>\n<p>\nAfter dropping Brooke off, Lynsey insisted on driving me to A&amp;E at Watford General Hospital. She was worried I might have concussion. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctor said because I'd passed out, he wanted to check my heart. And I was horrified when the ECG detected a problem with the rhythm of my heart. </p>\n<p>\nTerrifyingly, the doctor said I was suffering from heart block where the electrical impulses that make the heart beat don't always reach the heart. </p>\n<p>\nI was lucky my heart had started beating again  but next time I might not be so lucky and if I wasn't treated, could have a full-blown cardiac arrest. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors have been unable to find a reason for my heart block. As they have also found a slight problem with a heart valve, it is possibly something I was born with. </p>\n<p>\nSince then I've had a pacemaker fitted. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors say when the children are ten they will have to be tested too. </p>\n<p>\nBut it's something I feel should be routinely tested for in everyone. If it weren't for Lynsey insisting I go to A&amp;E that day, I might not have discovered this. </p>\n<p>\nAnd ultimately I could have suddenly suffered a potentially fatal cardiac arrest at any time. </p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By LYNSEY HAYWOOD","teaser":"AS Bolton's Fabrice Muamba recovers from heart attack, we show you how to save a life","headline":"What would YOU do?","section":"woman","id":4210291,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210291/What-would-YOU-do-if-someone-collapsed-in-front-of-you.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H2G-_1475241a.jpg","subdeck":"Cardiac arrest ...

Aspirin works by suppressing the creation of prostaglandin, a hormone that carries information about pain to the brain. It was first sold as 1899 as a powder by the German firm Bayer. </p>\n<p>\nAspirin can clearly do more than banish headaches, though some experts believe it could do more harm than good. </p>\n<p>\nHere, we look at some of the surprising uses. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDepression </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSOME experts believe depression and inflammation could be linked after small studies found some depressed people have high levels of cytokines  naturally occurring chemicals with inflammatory properties  in the body. </p>\n<p>\nSo because it's an anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin might be able to help. </p>\n<p>\nOne study followed 386 women for ten years  22 developed depression after the age of 50. </p>\n<p>\nOf these only one had taken aspirin. </p>\n<p>\nBut among those who did not develop depression, almost a third were taking it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAcne </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA KEY ingredient in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is used in many of today's off-the-shelf acne products. </p>\n<p>\nMix a tablet with water then rub the solution on to your skin. </p>\n<p>\nLeave it on for two minutes, then rinse off. </p>\n<p>\nThis will dry your pimples out and your spots will go faster. </p>\n<p>\nIf you have normal or dry skin don't try this more than once a week as you will lose too much moisture from your skin. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nDandruff </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA COMMON cause of this is a tiny yeast called Pityroporum ovale, which lives on the scalp. Aspirin is a mild anti-fungal so it can help. </p>\n<p>\nCrush two tablets and mix them with one serving of shampoo. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture to your hair and leave for about two minutes so it can settle on your scalp. </p>\n<p>\nRinse it off and shampoo your hair again. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDementia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSTUDIES have found that Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is an inflammatory condition of the brain so aspirin might be effective in treating it. </p>\n<p>\nResearch carried out in Utah, involving the observation and testing of more than 3,000 people, suggested taking it could reduce the risk of contracting the condition by 23 per cent. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nHeart disease </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIT IS thought it can help by reducing inflammation in the arteries that supply the heart  making the blood less likely to become sticky and form a deadly clot. </p>\n<p>\nIn some studies, taking aspirin reduced the likelihood of a cardiovascular problem, including heart disease, heart attack or stroke, by as much as 44 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nExperts also found it can help someone who has already had a heart attack or a stroke by reducing the risk of having another by a third. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAthlete's Foot </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nATHLETE'S foot and other fungal infections can be treated using a few aspirin pills and talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nGrind three pills until they are in a powder form. </p>\n<p>\nThen mix the powdered aspirin with some talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture on to the infected area of skin. </p>\n<p>\nDo this process twice a day to kill the fungi and to treat the irritation. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nIn-growing hair </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHAVE you got a painful in-growing hair that won't budge? </p>\n<p>\nAspirin is made up of acetylsalicylic acid, which exfoliates skin and has anti-inflammatory properties. </p>\n<p>\nSo applying a thick paste made of crushed aspirin and a little warm water could help you remove it with ease. </p>\n<p>\nApply it to the hair and leave to settle for ten to 15 minutes. Then remove using warm water. </p>\n<p>\nThis should get rid of the hair, or at least make it easier to remove. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nPre-eclampsia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA DAILY dose of aspirin during pregnancy could cut the risk of pre-eclampsia, a condition that threatens the lives of both mother and baby. </p>\n<p>\nA study of 32,000 women published in The Lancet medical journal found that mums who took it were ten per cent less likely to develop the condition. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nInsect bites </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAS these are marked by redness, itchiness and sometimes a burning sensation, aspirin  an anti-inflammatory  can help clear these up. </p>\n<p>\nWet the affected area and rub a small aspirin over the skin to help relieve the pain caused by mosquito bites or stings from a bee, wasp or hornet. </p>\n<p>\nTaking it orally could also help to reduce any painful swelling. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nShingles </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nASPIRIN is thought to be one of the most effective treatments for dealing with the pain and uncomfortable symptoms associated with shingles. </p>\n<p>\nMash two tablets into a paste and use a clean cotton swab to apply it to the skin. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nThe risks... </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<li></li> ONE in five asthmatics are at risk of a severe reaction to aspirin, according to research in Australia and the UK. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A recent London University study linked taking aspirin with a 30 per cent rise in the risk of debilitating  and potentially fatal  internal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A study last January advised doctors to stop prescribing aspirin to ward off heart attacks as it raises the risk of bleeding in the stomach by a third. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Oxford researchers say a daily dose as small as 75mg could increase the risk of abdominal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Anyone with an allergy to aspirin or a bleeding or clotting disorder should not use it for any purpose. </p>\n<p>\n<b>If in doubt, consult your GP.</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 01:04:00 +0000","teaser":"MANY illnesses and now even CANCER could apparently be prevented by taking aspirin","headline":"Aspirin's not just for headaches","section":"woman","id":4210700,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210700/The-drug-that-can-treat-depression-dementia-cancer-and-in-growing-hairs.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22ASP---_1475246a.jpg","subdeck":"Painless ... aspirin has been hailed as a treatment for depression, dementia and even cancer","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":true},{"isTop":0,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"'Cameron fills my life with love and joy' ...

Having Cameron has been the making of me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lad is also a brilliant big brother to Luke, ten, Jake, four, Mackenzie, two, and four-month-old Brooklyn. </p>\n<p>\nAs the Down's Syndrome Association runs its awareness campaign this week, courageous Crystal, 27, revealed how Cameron has made her a better person. </p>\n<p>\nAround one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down's and there are 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough the chance of a baby having Down's is higher for older mothers, more babies with Down's are born to younger women  because they have more children. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal fell pregnant at 15 and as the likelihood of having a Down's baby was considered so rare for a mum-to-be of her age, doctors had not even asked if she wanted to be tested. </p>\n<p>\nLike many women, Crystal assumed only older mums had Down's children. She admits when she was first told of her son's diagnosis at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire, she was horrified and ashamed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was still getting my head round the fact he had Down's when three hours after his birth he was whisked off for a scan. </p>\n<p>\n\"When they brought my baby back and told me he had three holes in his heart and would need a major op to fix it, I just fell apart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe devastated teenager sobbed in her mother's arms. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home in Wetherby, West Yorks, sharing a room with her sister and her new tot made life even harder. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I couldn't bear to go out, not because I didn't want to show him off but I was so scared he would die. </p>\n<p>\n\"He seemed so vulnerable and I was way out of my depth. I sobbed myself to sleep every night and kept thinking 'why me?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCameron's dad, 16-year-old Drew, stood by her  visiting the pair regularly. But Crystal was convinced he would leave her. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"All his mates were out clubbing and he was a 16-year-old lad with a baby with Down's.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt three months old Cameron went in for the op to fix the holes in his heart. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal was warned he would be in hospital for up to three months but after just three weeks he was doing so well he was discharged. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home, while most girls her age were out having fun, 16-year-old Crystal was caring for a very sick baby. Then something amazing happened. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Cameron just fought and fought and suddenly I realised it was time to stop feeling sorry for myself. I gave myself a massive boot up the backside. </p>\n<p>\n\"OK, my son wasn't the perfect baby but he was my son and he deserved a mum who would fight for him all the way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDrew and Crystal moved in together and the teen parents learnt Makaton, a language programme using signs and symbols, so they could communicate with Cameron as he grew up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Being able to sign was a major bonus. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Cameron and I formed a remarkable bond and suddenly I realised his disability was anything but.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Crystal fell pregnant with another child when Cameron was just 18 months old, a few friends said she wouldn't be able to cope. </p>\n<p>\nShe was offered a nuchal scan to determine the likelihood of Down's, but turned it down. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I didn't want to know. I coped with Cameron and I knew I'd cope again.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBaby Luke was born healthy, as was Jake two years after. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"The specialists don't know why I had a baby with Down's so young and then it never occurred again. They say it's extremely rare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Cameron was seven, Crystal split from his dad, suddenly finding herself a single mum to three boys. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I'm not saying it was easy but dealing with Cameron gave me the strength to deal with anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Some people close to me thought I would have a breakdown but it was actually Cameron that kept me going. </p>\n<p>\n\"He developed this really cheeky, funny personality. He had me in stitches and when I was down he seemed to sense it and would give me a cuddle. He's just so happy I couldn't be sad around him.\" </p>\n<p>\nCrystal has since found love with 21-year-old shop worker Darren Hooper. The couple have two sons. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Life's good. Cameron goes to a special needs school which he loves and has really boosted his speech and learning. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll admit that when I first heard my little boy had Down's I reached the depths of despair but now I don't see him as a boy with problems. </p>\n<p>\n\"I see him for what he is  an unbelievably loving little boy who loves cuddles and has tons of affection and love to give. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I know people thought I didn't have the maturity to cope but having Cameron has been the making of me.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Crystal has high hopes for Cameron's future: \"I would love him to move out of home, get a job, marry and go on to have his own family one day and there's no reason why he can't achieve any of those dreams. </p>\n<p>\n\"Cameron has ambitions like any boys his age. He loves playing sports and listening to Lady GaGa. </p>\n<p>\n\"He tells me he wants to be a footballer one day and I tell him he should aim high and go for it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Every child, no matter if they have Down's syndrome, should be given a chance to prove what they can do and lead as ordinary a life as possible.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSarah offers other parents hope </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nDOWN'S syndrome actress Sarah Gordy is proof that people with disabilities can lead a full and rewarding life. </p>\n<p>\nThe 34-year-old  who plays Lady Pamela on BBC drama Upstairs Downstairs  has starred in many TV shows and plays. And her mum Jane, 63, could not be more proud of her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jane, speaking about discovering her first-born had Down's syndrome, admitted: \"Being completely honest, if I was given a test and told my baby had Down's I would have considered a termination. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'd have been terrified about not being able to look after her. But that saddens me now. </p>\n<p>\n\"When I fell pregnant I wasn't ready to be a mum. In my 20s at the time, I'd never changed a nappy so I felt very unprepared. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Sarah was born I couldn't believe how beautiful she was.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane didn't have any tests for Down's syndrome because she was under 28 when she fell pregnant. But the paediatrician noticed Sarah had the condition from the moment he saw her. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"Calling my husband Jerry aside, he told him that Sarah had the condition. Not only that, but he asked him not to tell me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He said it was important for me to form a bond with Sarah first. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking back I don't know how poor Jerry kept it to himself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt wasn't until four days later that Jane found out. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was heartbroken and terrified I would lose my baby. He kept telling me about potential heart problems and operations she'd need. </p>\n<p>\n\"But finding out turned me from a girl into a fully-fledged mother.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily, Sarah didn't need any operations. Jane said: \"I wish I knew back then what I know now, about how much of an amazing life she'd have.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane had another daughter, Catherine, now 32, 16 months after Sarah and admits she felt relief when tests showed she did not have Down's. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"I just didn't know if having two children with the condition would be too much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wish parents-to-be were provided with more information about Down's syndrome before they make a decision about termination. </p>\n<p>\n\"No one should ever feel pressured either way, but it's such a difficult decision to make without knowing exactly what it will entail.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile everything took longer with Sarah, Jane says she soon realised her daughter had an incredible ability to feel what other people feel. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"If I'm ever stressed or worried and I tell Sarah I'm fine she will say, 'No you're not,' and I have to come clean. We're very close as no emotion goes unnoticed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Jane explains that Down's syndrome actors work very differently to those without the condition. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The interesting thing about Sarah is she doesn't really act. She feels very emotional on set. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't fake emotion, so instead she believes everything about her character. </p>\n<p>\n\"Once she was acting as an abused wife and I saw how much the abusive words were hurting her. </p>\n<p>\n\"When she came off set I said, 'Sarah  you're a beautiful, successful actress' and she slowly remembered that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to think that Sarah being successful on TV gives parents who are expecting a Down's syndrome child strength and confidence that their child can lead a really healthy life.\"\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL BOYS, Chief Executive at Down's Syndrome Association</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWE have seen great improvements in the lives of people with Down's syndrome since the association's formation in 1970. </p>\n<p>\nToday, the average life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome is 60 to 65 years, compared to 35 to 40 back in 1970.

Sick of her unhealthy lifestyle and size 18 waist, Linda decided to ditch booze for good. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I was stuck in a destructive routine of drinking and eating too much. </p>\n<p>\nI'd just broken up with my boyfriend and wanted to move on. I'd read about the LighterLife diet and wanted to give it a go. </p>\n<p>\nOvernight I gave up alcohol and started eating four food packs a day, containing 5-600 calories. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a complete shock to the system and the first week was really hard, but I knew it would be worth it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI used to drink a bottle of wine most nights, on Fridays I'd have work drinks and Saturdays I'd be out drinking with non-work friends. </p>\n<p>\nSundays were spent recovering. It was relentless. Drinking with clients and colleagues was part of my life and I'd got myself into really bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only after I gave it up I noticed what a big impact it had. </p>\n<p>\nNow after a work night out I'll come into the office whistling and full of energy, while my colleagues are often a step behind me. And I remember all the office gossip! </p>\n<p>\nIt's been five months now and I feel stronger, more confident and I have more energy than ever before. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from 14st 9lb to 12st, from a size 18-16 to a size 14-12  and I know I look as good as I feel. </p>\n<h1>\nLaura Coventry, 33 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDDING photographer Laura, from Glasgow, went teetotal two years ago after bingeing on boozy nights out left her with huge memory blanks. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most girls in their twenties and thirties I lived for the weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThe prospect of partying and heavy drinking got me through the working week and I'd wish away Monday to Friday. </p>\n<p>\nI drank a lot, not just a couple of glasses of wine, but enough to get seriously drunk. I just loved the euphoria and the buzz that it gave me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd suffer terrible hangovers, I'd regularly be in bed until 5pm with headaches and feeling sick, but I saw it as a price worth paying to let my inhibitions go. </p>\n<p>\nOn occasions I'd been out with friends, woken up with a shocking hangover  and realised there were huge blanks in my night out I couldn't remember. </p>\n<p>\nIt really scared me and for the first time I questioned why I was doing this to myself. I knew I had to change. </p>\n<p>\nThe first two weeks were the hardest, but I managed the first three-month goal I set myself, then extended that to six months. </p>\n<p>\nNow not one drop of booze has passed my lips since February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nSome friends want me to start going out drinking with them again and say that I've proven my point, but I'm determined not to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI have a fantastic new boyfriend now and I wake up on Mondays smiling, something which never happened before. </p>\n<p>\nI still party but I don't need alcohol to get a buzz. Life feels so much fuller and better. </p>\n<h1>\nLucy Troughton, 31 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>IT was last October when Lucy went teetotal after realising the damaging effect alcohol was having on her mood. The waitress, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI lived in London between the ages of 19 to 22 and I was out drinking socially most nights. But when I fell pregnant at 23 I didn't drink for the best part of a year. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not that I missed it but I still felt very young to be stuck at home, not out partying like I used to. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a band so drinking was almost expected of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of my friends didn't have kids so there was always someone around to go out drinking with. I soon reverted back to weekend drinking. </p>\n<p>\nI got stuck in a rut of Mondays being a write-off, like I was waiting for the day to finish the moment I woke up. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to be on form for my daughter Grace, now seven, but I was tired and only realised when it was too late that I was becoming depressed. </p>\n<p>\nIn mid-October last year I decided enough was enough and gave up alcohol completely. </p>\n<p>\nIt was, and still is, very hard. I didn't go out and became a bit of a recluse, focusing more on my music, gardening and reading. </p>\n<p>\nIt's had a huge effect and I really love the mornings now. </p>\n<p>\nI feel so clear-headed. And people often comment on how I'm 'glowing' now. </p>\n<p>\nThe idea of a glass of wine with a meal is still a temptation but it does get easier to say \"No\". </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal has taught me what I really value. And I'm happier than ever. </p>\n<h1>\nKatie Carr, 22 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BARMAID Katie from Bridlington, East Yorks, was a beer-swilling, pizza-scoffing ladette. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She went teetotal in July 2010 after binge drinking caused her to have a seizure and a new love interest persuaded her to transform her life. Katie says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTequila, sambuca, J&#228;gerbombs  I wasn't fussy. I could get through 20 pints of lager in a night. </p>\n<p>\nIn June 2010, I'd been fired from my job as a waitress for consistently turning up to work reeking of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree weeks later, I'd spent &#163;1,200 in my local pub. I put on nine stone in a year on a diet of booze and pizza, weighed 18.5st and was a size 22. I didn't wear make-up or dress girly. </p>\n<p>\nOne night in July, I was out with friends when I had a seizure in a nightclub. </p>\n<p>\nI was carried out by a bouncer and taken to hospital by ambulance. The doctor instructed me to stop drinking for six weeks while they ran tests. </p>\n<p>\nWhile I was sober, I had time to re-evaluate who I was. </p>\n<p>\nWanting to seize the day, I contacted the bouncer and asked him, \"When are you going to take me out?\". I was amazed when he said later that week. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the CT scans came back clear  I'd just drunk too much. I've not been back on the booze since and have now lost eight stone. </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal is one of the best things I've ever done. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from ladette to lady. </p>\n<h1>\nRebecca Spencer, 35 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE charity worker from Southend, Essex, went teetotal seven years ago after a charity trip shocked her into a lifestyle change. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2003 I moved to London from Newcastle in search of a new job. </p>\n<p>\nI had a big group of friends and we used to go out every weekend and always drank a lot of vodka. It was just something we did and I didn't see it as a problem. </p>\n<p>\nIn 2005 I embarked on a charity trip with Help The Aged to India to photograph how people were rebuilding their lives after the 2004 tsunami. </p>\n<p>\nIt was the most eye-opening, inspiring and horrendous experience, all at the same time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe destruction was overpowering and having an alcoholic drink in that context seemed completely ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nThe experience changed my values and made me completely reassess myself. </p>\n<p>\nJust a few days after being in India I was in Covent Garden surrounded by young professionals knocking back drinks without a thought. </p>\n<p>\nI'd seen people with absolutely nothing and I decided to re-focus my life on the things that counted. Alcohol seemed such a self-destructive extravagance. </p>\n<p>\nAs soon as I gave up I realised I'd never even really liked the taste of alcohol  it was just the social side of it I enjoyed. </p>\n<p>\nNine months after the charity trip I fell pregnant and later had my son. </p>\n<p>\nI felt great and no part of me wanted to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI've been teetotal for seven years now and feel healthier, more energetic and have much more in my pocket  why go back? </p>","timestamp":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"INCREASING numbers of people are binning alcohol  here five women reveal what it's like to live without booze","headline":"Why we're all tee totally happy","section":"woman","id":4205741,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/SNF20BOOZE--_1474058a.jpg","subdeck":"On the wagon ...

Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

That's why they are artists. Can a singer judge another singer as well as a record executive?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe music tycoon also blasted \"petty\" Beeb bosses over the scheduling clash, laying the blame firmly at their door. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They're the ones who seem to be making it into a battle. We were always going to air in March because of my timings. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"The BBC are doing this as the more they talk about us the more headlines they get. But I don't like it when the shows clashes. It is petty scheduling.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut BBC1 controller Danny Cohen played down the battle for viewers, saying: \"I'm not going to put a number on what we see as success for The Voice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday Cowell said this year's BGT will be the best ever, erasing memories of last year's uninspiring run. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"There's a mixture of good and what I call good old-fashioned British eccentricity. </p>\n<p>\n\"The best way to judge the show is not to take it too seriously, but the good ones are always going to get through and that is the important thing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>With a glint in his eye, he added: \"There will be some strippers of course  one or two.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he said there will be nine acts in the semi-final instead of eight, ensuring even more talent gets through. </p>\n<p>\nSimon, 52, also sang the praises of Walliams, 40  who rose to fame alongside Matt Lucas in BBC1 comedy Little Britain. Cowell said: \"I've been trying to get David to do this show for the past two years. There were these two bellringers last year and I texted him saying: 'It's you and Matt!'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Some of his characters on Little Britain are like some of our contestants.

We could mess up these people's careers.\" Will.i.am, who is pals with Cheryl Cole, who he manages, admitted he would stop at nothing to win the show but was tight-lipped about which stars he will be inviting on to the series. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I don't want to reveal my tricks. I'm just trying to do as much as I can, I swear to God, including technology and people.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe confessed that show bosses asked him and Jessie J to ramp up their banter during filming to boost ratings but both refused. Will said: \"Before the cameras went on before the first day they asked us to turn it up for TV and Jessie told me, 'I'm not going to do that for TV ratings, that's fake.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We said it to each other, then two days in the crews were like, 'Thanks a lot'  but then the banter was real.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite claiming he is mentoring four potential superstars, Will.i.am is worried about competing against \"legend\" Tom Jones because he knows every trick in the book. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I think I have about four people who are really big, out of the ten in my team  four big global artists. </p>\n<p>\n\"Out of all the singers, I am nervous about Tom's team.

I thought, 'Here we go... people are going to say he can't skate, he's getting his body out for the vote,' and I've had a real problem with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, after asking fans what they thought, he reluctantly agreed. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Then I thought to myself, 'Let the voting public decide.'

I got in the water to try to swim to safety, but then I suddenly remembered Jaws! </p>\n<p>\n\"This was in the Irish Sea, so I really wasn't going to be killed by a shark, but even so I had this absolute terror and got back in the boat pretty quickly.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGeraldine continued: \"It was really frightening  but the sea is. It's just so huge and we're not really meant to be there. Fortunately a lifeboat came and rescued us.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYou will have to watch all four parts of Titanic to see if Jenna-Louise and Geraldine's characters have such a lucky escape. </p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By ANNE RICHARDSON","teaser":"JENNA-LOUISE Coleman has revealed her own escape from the sea when she was a child","headline":"Titanic left us all at sea","section":"tv","id":4215491,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4215491/Titanic-news-Jenna-Louise-Coleman-and-Geraldine-Somerville-were-swept-away-by-the-sea-as-children.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/MAID-532_1476714a.jpg","subdeck":"Water escape ...

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b><a href=\"mailto:d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

Then I want to stay here for a long time after that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm very, very happy here. From the moment I arrived, everyone has treated me really well. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's down to me to repay that kindness and good feeling I've had from everyone with some performances out on the field.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCity have nine games left to try and edge out champions Manchester United  meaning Aguero still has plenty of time to add to his haul. He is excited by the return of fellow Argentinian Carlos Tevez and hopes it can help him reach 30 goals for the season. </p>\n<p>\nAguero said: \"It would be lovely to score 30  but the most important thing is the team getting the right results at the end of the day. </p>\n<p>\n\"The main thing about scoring is not setting targets for yourself but scoring the goals that win points for the team.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTevez made a sensational comeback after six months on the sidelines by creating the winner for Samir Nasri against Chelsea in midweek. </p>\n<p>\nAnd while Aguero, Mario Balotelli and Edin Dzeko have carried City through in his absence, the former skipper has been welcomed back. </p>\n<p>\nHis countryman believes the experience Tevez has of English football can be crucial over the last nine matches. </p>\n<p>\nAguero, 23, said: \"He was really keen to play, he was bursting to get out there on the field. We all know he's an important player for us, a key player. With the nine games remaining in the season, I think he can bring a lot to the side. </p>\n<p>\n\"If and when selected, I think it's an important time for him to come back. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's got five years' experience of playing in the Premier League. </p>\n<p>\n\"We have a lot of good players here and he is one other player. But he will be very, very important to us because he's one in a long list of top-quality players at this club. He will bring a lot to the party for what remains of the season.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBalotelli looked out of sorts against Chelsea, while a question mark still hangs over the future of Bosnian hitman Dzeko in the summer. </p>\n<p>\nAll three have played their part for City this season  but Aguero believes Tevez will freshen things up. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Through what happened and the situation that came about, I've not had much chance to play with Carlos. </p>\n<p>\n\"But what we have done between the three of us  myself, Mario and Edin  is to give a good account of ourselves in terms of goalscoring. We've done fairly well but it would be nice to have Carlos on board to add goals to the threesome. </p>\n<p>\n\"But it's down to the manager and hopefully he continues to pick me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCity's late comeback to beat Chelsea 2-1 at the Etihad on Wednesday was the sort of triumph which rivals United have mastered over the years. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Aguero reckons it was proof that City have what it takes to go all the way and lift the title on May 13. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"That's what it's all about in a title race, not giving up. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are fighting for the title, we have confidence. </p>\n<p>\n\"We're the sort of team who know if we go behind we can come back and win the game. </p>\n<p>\n\"The key is we are in a position now where we can't afford to drop any points. Manchester United are quite experienced in these title chases but we have to focus on ourselves. </p>\n<p>\n\"We have dropped a few points here and there along the way but that's in the past. We are playing well and we must carry on in that vein and concentrate on not letting more points go  that's the key to it.\"\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By MARTIN BLACKBURN","teaser":"EXCLUSIVE: ARGY star insists stories linking him to Madrid have not come from his camp","headline":"Aguero: I stay","section":"sport","id":4214972,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214972/Sergio-Aguero-Im-so-happy-at-Man-City-I-dont-want-Real-move.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/aguero_1476711a.jpg","subdeck":"LEAP OF FAITH ...

The injured Sergio Aguero was replaced by Edin Dzeko and Carlos Tevez was again on the bench but the visitors did control the early possession. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was not until the ninth minute that Gael Clichy found space to deliver a ball into the Stoke box but Asmir Begovic claimed easily. </p>\n<p>\nStoke had their first opening after a free-kick was crossed to the back post for Crouch but Cameron Jerome was unable to turn his downward header goalwards. </p>\n<p>\nAt the other end, David Silva and Pablo Zabaleta both had efforts deflected wide and Yaya Toure shot over from distance. </p>\n<p>\nDean Whitehead was given a talking to by referee Howard Webb after catching Silva with his arm challenging for a high ball, with play held up while the Spaniard received treatment. </p>\n<p>\nStoke almost took the lead in the 41st minute when a Matthew Etherington corner was met by a deft glancing header from Ryan Shawcross but Pablo Zabaleta cleared off the line. </p>\n<p>\nMario Balotelli broke through as the first half went into injury time but shot tamely at Begovic. </p>\n<p>\nDzeko had a chance to break the deadlock in the opening minute of the second half as he controlled a lofted pass from Barry, but he could not get it down quick enough to round Begovic. </p>\n<p>\nCameron Jerome was replaced by Jermaine Pennant in the 51st minute and Hart was forced to block an effort from Walters at point-blank range. </p>\n<p>\nStoke claimed the lead with a sensational strike from Crouch just before the hour. </p>\n<p>\nA long clearance from Begovic was headed on by the lanky front man, before he took the return from Pennant, flicked it up and twisted to volley over Hart and into the top corner. </p>\n<p>\nMancini reacted by sending on Adam Johnson for Silva and then Tevez for Barry in the hope of gaining more width. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Yaya Toure from a central position - a non-threatening 35 yards out - who sledgehammered in the equaliser. </p>\n<p>\nThe Ivorian's firecracker caught the head of Shawcross and it was enough to wrong-foot Begovic and slam into the net. </p>\n<p>\nPulis introduced Wilson Palacios in place of Etherington to shore up his side and Shawcross came close with a header that looped agonisingly over. </p>\n<p>\nYaya Toure came close at the death but another powerful effort from the all-action midfielder flew just over the top. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 15:18:59 +0000","teaser":"PETER CROUCH smashed a wonder goal to shell-shock Man City but Yaya Toure hit back with a long range strike of his own as Roberto Mancini's side showed they are well up for the fight","headline":"Stoke City 1 Man City 1","section":"sport","id":4216487,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4216487/Stoke-City-1-1-Man-City-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/crouch2_1477285a.jpg","subdeck":"PETER'S PERFECT ...

But Caldwell's strike left the home fans frustrated once more with just five league wins at Anfield all season. </p>\n<p>\nLiverpool once again struggled to find any fluency early on and Wigan gave them a scare when Victor Moses ghosted past Jose Enrique to fire in a shot that Martin Skrtel did well to block. </p>\n<p>\nSteven Gerrard bobbled a shot wide for the hosts before Stewart Downing's effort whistled wide after he exchanged passes with Suarez. </p>\n<p>\nBut the Reds were stunned when Skrtel gave away a penalty as he swung a boot at Jamie Carragher's aimless headed clearance and caught Moses in the face. </p>\n<p>\nReferee Lee Mason pointed to the spot and, after a couple of minutes' delay for Moses to receive treatment, Maloney tucked his penalty past the goalkeeper's right hand. </p>\n<p>\nFive minutes before half-time Liverpool finally forced Ali Al Habsi into a save when Suarez's 25-yard curling effort was tipped around the post. </p>\n<p>\nDespite returning to the field Moses was replaced by Albert Crusat before the interval. </p>\n<p>\nAnother Gerrard shot forced Al Habsi to palm the ball behind but from the corner Jordan Henderson's dipping shot was easily claimed by the goalkeeper. </p>\n<p>\nHenderson, who had incurred the ire of Anfield on a number of occasions, was replaced by Andy Carroll for the second half. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Liverpool's two most reliable attacking forces Gerrard and Suarez who combined for the equaliser just two minutes after the restart. </p>\n<p>\nSkrtel's sliding challenge reached Dirk Kuyt on the edge of the penalty area and he bounced a pass back to Suarez who played the ball to Gerrard on the right and continued his run to convert the return with a shot across Al Habsi. </p>\n<p>\nLiverpool should have been ahead in the 53rd minute when Skrtel's downward far-post header bounced over Al Habsi but Suarez, under pressure from Gary Caldwell, inexplicably punched the ball over the line when he was so close to the goal he could have let it hit him and it would still probably have gone in. </p>\n<p>\nThe Reds were made to pay in the 63rd minute when Carroll's header defending a free-kick dropped to James McCarthy just outside the area. </p>\n<p>\nHis shot deflected off Carragher to Caldwell, who showed composure not usually befitting a centre-back in front of goal to sidestep Carroll and fire past Reina. </p>\n<p>\nJonjo Shelvey's 74th-minute arrival for Downing allowed Gerrard to move into a more advanced position.\n</p>\n<p>\nWith seven minutes to go Raheem Sterling, signed from QPR for &#163;600,000 just over two years ago, was given his debut as a replacement for Kuyt.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe youngster had one good run along the edge of the 18-yard box which almost set up a shooting opportunity but it was asking a lot for the teenager to have an impact on a game in which a number of his vastly more experienced team-mates had failed to impose themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the final whistle Wigan's small band of travelling fans were ecstatic but the pervading feeling at Anfield was one of growing discontent.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 15:38:40 +0000","teaser":"GARY CALDWELL was the unlikely hero as Wigan piled on the misery for Liverpool","headline":"Liverpool 1 Wigan 2","section":"sport","id":4216509,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4216509/Liverpool-1-Wigan-2-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/01_cald_1477198a.jpg","subdeck":"EYES DOWN ...

and halted Blackburn's revival. </p>\n<p>\nSteven Nzonzi nodded Rovers' consolation in a contest charged with feeling as it was Bolton;s first match since Fabrice Muamba's collapse last weekend. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStBolton manager Owen Coyle named an unchanged line-up from his side's last Premier League game as the Lancashire side aimed to put the emotion generated by Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest last week to one side against Blackburn at the Reebok Stadium. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith Muamba still in intensive care, none of Coyle's players took up the option of sitting the game out, instead committing themselves to try and gain three valuable points in pursuit of top-flight safety. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn have adopted a respectful tone in the build-up, but Steve Kean's men were chasing a third successive win and were also unchanged. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Bolton supporters applauded from the moment the montage of Muamba began, right through until the handshake, a stand full of placards reading 'Muamba 6' held up opposite the directors' box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was soon evident the Bolton fans would be in full voice and Mark Davies fed David Ngog, whose cross was scrambled out of the Rovers penalty area. </p>\n<p>\nMartin Petrov was inches away from finding Ngog with an intelligent through-ball that ended up running on to Paul Robinson. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov let fly himself a couple of minutes later and Robinson had to watch the ball carefully in flight before beating it away. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere was little doubt Petrov was keen to make an impression and the Bulgarian shrugged Jason Lowe off the ball rather too easily, only to roll a disappointing shot wide of the far post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton keeper Adam Bogdan was thankful Davies was on hand to clear after he dropped Robinson's deep free-kick in a packed penalty area. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNgog got his head to a Petrov cross at the other end, but his effort lacked power and Robinson gathered with ease. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson's diving header turned Petrov's deep cross away for a corner, which Bolton could make nothing of. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn should have had a penalty when in-form striker Junior Hoilett went charging into the box and was nudged over by Gretar Steinsson. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTV replays showed there had been contact with the man, and none with the ball, but referee Andre Marriner waved play on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton were indebted to Tim Ream, who slid in to ensure Yakubu did not get on the end of a Marcus Olsson cross that looked like presenting him with a tap-in. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd they immediately profited when Petrov crossed from the right and Steven Nzonzi only succeeded in flicking it on to David Wheater, who seemed as surprised as anyone when the ball ended up in the bottom corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPratley was just off target as Bolton tried to press home their advantage, although Yakubu was inches away from equalising as he rose to meet Olsson's cross with a powerful header that just went wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov's shot was touched behind by Robinson, which only offered Bolton the chance to cause more damage from the corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd this time there was no look of surprise as Wheater profited from Ryo Miyaichi's cross to power home his second. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBogdan did not pay the penalty for yet more poor handling and not long afterwards Scott Dann's diving far-post header landed in the side-netting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson needed treatment within seconds of the re-start after he was caught from behind by Miyaichi. </p>\n<p>\nThe full-back was able to continue, although as he was ushered back on to the field Miyaichi curled narrowly over for Bolton. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWheater cleared after some slack play from Nigel Reo-Coker had almost put them in trouble and from the throw-in, Bogdan came to collect Nzonzi's back header. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNgog was close to a third for Bolton at the other end as he rose to meet Petrov's inswinging cross. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nDavies completely mis-kicked as he was presented with a shooting chance just outside the box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd Bolton were made to pay as Bogdan failed to shift Yakubu from his line of vision until it was far too late as the hosts attempted to defend Morten Gamst Pedersen's corner and Nzonzi took advantage to nod home. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was breathless stuff and Davies should have restored Bolton's two-goal cushion when Miyaichi picked him out from the right, completely unmarked, six yards out. Somehow though, he glanced the header wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson barged Steinsson off the ball by the corner flag but Hoilett let the pull-back run under his foot. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBogdan needed treatment after taking a thud in the ribs from Yakubu. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn the meantime, David Dunn was introduced for Mauro Formica. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhen play began again, Davies carved out an excellent opportunity for Petrov, but his shot nearly struck the corner flag it was so far wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIvan Klasnic replaced Ngog 11 minutes from time as Petrov waited to take a corner which he eventually dropped on to Pratley's head. But he was off target too. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYakubu bundled Hoilett's near-post cross just the wrong side of the post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn were now looking to take advantage of Bolton's anxiety and Yakubu was not far away with a close-range header two minutes from time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 15:55:40 +0000","teaser":"DAVID WHEATER'S first-half double lifted Bolton out of the drop zone and halted Rovers' revival","headline":"Bolton 2 Blackburn 1","section":"sport","id":4216527,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4216527/Bolton-2-Blackburn-1-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/wheater3_1477183a.jpg","subdeck":"GRET IN THERE! ...

missed the chance to move to within two points of Spurs in the race for the Champions League places after a stalemate at Stamford Bridge. </p>\n<p>\nIn a boring first half only Rafael van der Vaart came close to scoring but his double chance was saved by Petr Cech and then blocked by Ashley Cole. </p>\n<p>\nJuan Mata hit the post with a free-kick after the break as the Blues pressed for a much-needed win. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Tottenham who came closest to nicking victory through William Gallas, Emmanuel Adebayor and then Gareth Bale who crashed a header against the bar. </p>\n<p>\nBale again tested Cech with a dipping last-minute free-kick but it was to remain goalless  a result which suits Spurs more than the Blues. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFernando Torres was back on the bench as Didier Drogba returned to the Chelsea starting line-up. </p>\n<p>\nBut that change did little to ignite a surprisingly cagey opening. </p>\n<p>\nThe hosts looked the more threatening but any danger was well snuffed out by a Spurs defence without skipper Ledley King. </p>\n<p>\nScott Parker was his usual industrious self while Sandro was providing an effective shield in an unusually advanced role. </p>\n<p>\nBut in what has been such an exciting Premier League season the opening half of this London derby was a bore. </p>\n<p>\nDespite the Blues in desperate need for three points to close the gap on fourth-placed Spurs, both teams seemed too scared to lose. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nChelsea did have a half-hearted penalty appeal when Frank Lampard broke in the box and went tumbling under a challenge by WGallas but Martin Atkinson rightly waved play on. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Stamford Bridge had to wait until first-half injury time for the first real goalmouth action as Bale played in a neat ball to Luka Modric. </p>\n<p>\nHis deflected pull back found Van der Vaart ten yards out but the ball fell awkwardly on the Dutchman's right foot and he struck straight at Cech. </p>\n<p>\nCole then reacted quickly to block Van der Vaart's follow up and as the ball looped in the air, Adebayor could only head on to the roof of the net. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThings livened up a tad immediately after the break and Daniel Sturridge should have done better after Drogba headed him clear but he dragged his left-footed strike wide. </p>\n<p>\nAt the other end, Kyle Walker had Cech worried with a fierce right-footed drive after a lovely reverse pass by Bale but his effort crashed into the side of the net. </p>\n<p>\nRamires was up in arms after a coming together with Benoit Assou-Ekotto but Atkinson was again right to ignore the weakest of penalty claims. </p>\n<p>\nBoth sides were beginning to press forward with more purpose without either seriously threatening to get an opening goal. </p>\n<p>\nThat was until Juan Mata stepped up with a beautiful curling free-kick which had Brad Friedel beaten but struck his left post and bounced clear. </p>\n<p>\nThen Spurs  having hardly threatened all game  had three glorious chances which all went begging. </p>\n<p>\nFirst William Gallas headed over with a free header from a teasing Modric free-kick. </p>\n<p>\nThen Adebayor latched on to a Modric dink but he lost his balance after rounding Cech and Gary Cahill was back to clear his strike at an empty net. </p>\n<p>\nThe visitors were then cursing their luck as Bale crashed a header from a corner smack on to the bar and Adebayor again headed the rebound over. </p>\n<p>\nLampard tested his luck at the other end with a strike from distance as Chelsea ran out of ideas. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Bale again who came closest with a last-minute free-kick which had Cech scrambling to save and secure at least a point for his side. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS

Arteta struck his effort into the wall. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn the hour, a quick thrown out by Wojciech Szczesny sent away Czech midfielder Rosicky, who fed Gervinho down the left, but his cut-back from the byline flew across the six-yard box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRosicky was central to the action now, with Given beating away his 25-yard drive. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn 65 minutes, Heskey was replaced by Weimann. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal soon made a double change as Ramsey and full-back Andre Santos came on for Gervinho and Gibbs. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Brazilian's first contribution on his return to action from a broken ankle was to give the ball away to Weimann, but the Austrian lost composure in the Arsenal box and fluffed his big chance, stabbing across goal and wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRamsey made space for a shot on the turn from the edge of the penalty area, but was just wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith 13 minutes left, Walcott was replaced - to a standing ovation - by Oxlade-Chamberlain, while for Villa, Alan Hutton came off and Eric Lichaj went into the overworked defence. </p><p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal were screaming for a penalty when Oxlade-Chamberlain scampered away down the right and went down under a sliding challenge from Stephen Ireland, but referee Phil Dowd correctly ruled the midfielder had just got the ball first. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArteta cracked home a 25-yard free-kick in stoppage time to round off a fine afternoon's work from Wenger's reborn side. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal: Szczesny, Sagna, Djourou, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Gervinho, van Persie.

Gardner blasted a shot past Kenny's despairing dive, only to see the ball clatter the underside of the bar and bounce clear. </p>\n<p>\nHowever, within a minute Cisse was sent off for an ugly challenge on Campbell, his second red card since his arrival at Loftus Road in January. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTaarabt made way for Shaun Wright-Phillips on the hour as Hughes sought a way back into the game, but the home side continued to dominate. </p>\n<p>\nIt might have been all over within four minutes after Gardner's cross was allowed to travel across the six-yard box to McClean, but his shot was blocked superbly by Young. </p>\n<p>\nThe home side doubled their lead through on 69 minutes. McClean's first shot was blocked but he responded the fastest to fire the rebound into the net. </p>\n<p>\nThe game look wrapped up seven minutes later when a neat pass from David Vaughan set up Sessegnon, who rolled the ball under the advancing Kenny to make it 3-0. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAfter Bendtner had seen his header drop on to the roof of the visitors net, Taiwo gave the 10-men some cheer when he smashed a free-kick past Simon Mignolet. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 15:17:20 +0000","teaser":"IT was hard to mask 10-man Rangers' woes after Nicklas Bendtner nodded the home side towards an easy win","headline":"Sunderland 3 QPR 1","section":"sport","id":4216482,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4216482/Sunderland-3-1-QPR-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/bendtner2_1477161a.jpg","subdeck":"GOT THE NOD ...

He said 'All right, Nige?' But obviously he was not speaking so well because he was still a bit drugged up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nEven now, an emotional Reo-Coker struggles to find the words to express his feelings.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe admitted: \"For me just to see him after what I saw on the pitch and the news we got in the dressing room...\n</p>\n<p>\n\"When your heart is not beating for that long, simply to be alive and recognise anyone is a miracle.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Fabrice added, 'What happened?' I just choked up in all honesty. I couldn't even answer him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Darren told him, 'You just collapsed. But don't worry about it. You're going to be OK'.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I was probably only in with him for about a minute, maximum. In and out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But to see him lying there with all the tubes and everything, it was tough.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTough, yes, though just seeing Muamba again at all was a massive relief.\n</p>\n<p>\nMake no mistake, last weekend the Wanderers players were sure that they had lost him.\n</p>\n<p>\nReo-Coker revealed: \"We got back into the dressing room and heard they had shocked him six times.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I spoke to the doctor and Fabrice's heart wasn't beating. Loads of people would come to their own conclusion. I feared the worst. That's me being honest. So to see him there and for him to open his eyes and say 'All right, Nige?' that was more than enough.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I was overjoyed just to see him, even though he's still in a serious situation.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLast Saturday seemed like any other match-day for Bolton manager Owen Coyle and his side, who were putting up a decent battle in the Cup tie and holding fancied Tottenham at 1-1.\n</p>\n<p>\nA Gareth Bale own goal had given the visitors the lead after only six minutes, with Kyle Walker levelling for the Londoners five minutes later. There was all to play for.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, just after 6.10pm, everything changed and nobody will ever forget what happened next  least of all 27-year-old Reo-Coker.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe recalled: \"There were no signs. Nothing. I remember shortly before it happened. I asked him, 'Do you want to swap positions? Do you want me to push on and you can do the deep role?' Fabrice just laughed and said 'No'.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Then I remember him running back and collecting a half-clearance from one of our centre-backs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Next thing, I remember facing towards our right-back position and then I turned round and saw Fabrice on the floor.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I thought maybe there had been a collision with a Tottenham player. But I realised there was no one close to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He was shaking. I didn't know what it was.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I thought that he might have been having a fit but I had not known him to have any fits or epilepsy. I didn't realise how serious it was until the physio got there and I tried to help him turn Fabrice over. That's when I realised it was serious.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMore than 35,000 supporters looked on in disbelief as medics battled desperately to save Muamba.\n</p>\n<p>\nMinutes later, back in the Bolton dressing room, there was a feeling of total devastation.\n</p>\n<p>\nReo-Coker declared: \"It was very emotional. From the time he was on the pitch to being carried into the ambulance felt like a lifetime.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We have a very young team and a lot of them were in tears. Young Ryo Miyaichi, everyone was in tears.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There was nothing you could say to comfort each other. It was totally unexpected.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"One minute you're playing a game, the next Fabrice is lying there. No one saw it coming.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nReo-Coker has always been a natural leader. Wimbledon saw it when he was just 18 and appointed him their skipper.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe is currently wearing the armband for Wanderers in the absence of Kevin Davies, sidelined by a knee injury, so wanted to visit Muamba on behalf of the whole squad.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe reported back to them on Wednesday morning. He said: \"I told the boys I'd seen Fabrice and had a conversation with him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It did feel like a weight had been lifted off their shoulders. They feel a lot happier now.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"To see the miraculous recovery  he recognises his team-mates and family, he is talking and, the most important thing, he is alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It lifts a big burden off the players.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nToday, Reo-Coker will try to find the right words to get the Bolton players' minds back on football and their crunch relegation derby with Blackburn at the Reebok.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat team talk really could not be in better hands.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe explained: \"For me, this has been a life-changing experience. It just shows how precious life is. Personally, I am ready to go. I know I will be fine. I am just making sure the young players are ready.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"This is a big game, a six-pointer and for now we are going to play for Fabrice.\"\n</p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By MARTIN BLACKBURN","teaser":"REO-COKER was left close to tears at the words he had heard so many times before","headline":"He saw me and said: 'All right, Nige..?'","section":"sport","id":4214991,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214991/Nigel-Reo-Coker-says-Fabrice-Muamba-opened-his-eyes-and-said-All-right-Nige.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/nigelreocoker_1476735a.jpg","subdeck":"VISITORS ...

It is ironic then Mourinho could now scupper the appointment of Guardiola as the Blues' next boss. How? Let me explain... </p>\n<p>\nHaving spent four years at the helm of Barcelona, I can understand why Guardiola would be looking for a new job. He has already taken the Catalan giants to a different world in terms of football. </p>\n<p>\nAnd he has won everything there is to win. </p>\n<p>\nHe is only 41 and he will need a new challenge in the not-too-distant future. A Premier League club would be the next obvious mountain. </p>\n<p>\nBut I also believe Guardiola would want to bow out at Barcelona at the top. Of Europe. Of the world. And, most importantly, of La Liga. </p>\n<p>\nThey are currently second to Mourinho's Real Madrid, who look on course to finish as champions. If that happens, I cannot see Guardiola turning his back on Barcelona, even if they beat their El Clasico rivals to win the Champions League. </p>\n<p>\nGuardiola is a natural competitor as well as a super-natural coach. He'd surely not want to walk away after losing his La Liga crown. </p>\n<p>\nIt is a shame for Chelsea because I think Guardiola would be the perfect choice for them. Or any top club in Europe for that matter. </p>\n<p>\nWhat he has achieved since being appointed as Barcelona coach in 2008 is phenomenal. Three successive La Liga titles, two Champions League crowns, two UEFA Super Cups and two FIFA Club World Cups tells the story of his reign. </p>\n<p>\nHe has not only turned Barca into the best football team on the planet. </p>\n<p>\nHe has altered the perception of the sport, showing you no longer have to spend a fortune or select six-foot sprinters to secure success. Under his stewardship, the Catalans have become the standard-bearers for the way the Beautiful Game should be played. </p>\n<p>\nLook in the dictionary under football and it should simply read: Barcelona. If he were to take over at Chelsea, it would be a completely different job. </p>\n<p>\nBut that would be part of the attraction for him. He needs something different on his CV to display his attributes as a well-rounded coach. </p>\n<p>\nI don't know whether he would want a year off first, but it would be interesting to see how he would build a new team at Chelsea  even a new culture  while still acquiring the results to keep him in employment. </p>\n<p>\nAbramovich and his senior players might even have to change their philosophies to accommodate him. </p>\n<p>\nInterim-manager Roberto Di Matteo is doing a great job, despite Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Manchester City. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, Guardiola would be Abramovich's first choice  but then he would be most of Europe's first choice. </p>\n<p>\nI can see the Barca coach managing Chelsea one day. Just not yet. I do not think he would want to quit with Jose's hands on the Spanish title. </p>","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"<img src=\"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00361/VENABLES_361637a.jpg\"/> By TERRY VENABLES","teaser":"TERRY VENABLES says Pep will not want to quit Barca with Jose's hands on La Liga title","headline":"Why Pep won't take Blues job","section":"sport","id":4214946,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214946/Terry-Venables-Pep-wont-take-the-Blues-job-and-Jose-is-the-reason-why.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/jose_1476682a.jpg","subdeck":"HE'S BEHIND YOU ... but Jose sits out front in La Liga race","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":false},{"isTop":0,"attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"PACE MAKERS ...

I know that only too well from a past experience during the Malaysian Grand Prix when my fluid bottle broke. </p>\n<p>\n\"It meant I couldn't take on any liquids during one of the hottest and most physically tough races on the calendar. </p>\n<p>\n\"By the end of the race, I was in pretty bad shape  which shows you that, without proper hydration, your performance and your abilities behind the wheel are severely compromised. </p>\n<p>\n\"This is one of the toughest races because it's dealing with the humidity more than anything else. When you get on to the straight you can't breathe. </p>\n<p>\n\"That's normally a rest for us when we just change gears and play around with a few switches. But here you don't get that luxury as you can't breathe! </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The air coming into the car is so hot that it is very difficult to deal with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe weather here in Malaysia is so hot that Scottish driver Paul Di Resta joked that it is 'cruel' for the locals to live here. </p>\n<p>\nThe Force India ace added: \"Physically this is the toughest race of the year. Every time I come back, I cannot imagine how people can live here. It's cruel. It's a true test to show how fit you are. It's probably about 16 degrees hotter in the cockpit than outside. </p>\n<p>\n\"The surfaces are hotter, too, as you have various electrical components in the car. You can't wear a cool suit either, because you couldn't fit into the car wearing it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut even though both drivers admit this race will test them, Button insists they are all fit enough to cope. </p>\n<p>\nAfter the shocking scenes at White Hart Lane last week when Bolton's Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest, Button is hopeful that nothing like that will happen in F1. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"We all have a medical test for our licences. That is the only thing we're obligated to do  but most of us do a lot of fitness to keep in pretty good shape. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's very different for a footballer. We're obviously racing for quite a long time and it's more about endurance. For them, there's a lot of sprinting, it's very peaky in terms of heart rate. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of people do physical activity outside to get used to the humidity because it's such a shock for a lot of people who haven't been here before. </p>\n<p>\n\"Jean-Eric Vergne and a few of the others haven't been here before  and it's a real shock walking out. It hits you when you walk out of the airport.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b><li></li> LUCOZADE are proud to fuel the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes Team.

I looked at Mushy, he looked at me, and it was like, 'We're back'.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It can happen with just one ball. It's timing, picking the ball and judging the length. The best players pick length the quickest.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Guys like Sachin pick length as soon as the ball is delivered. I pick it quicker than Jimmy Anderson will. Hence Jimmy gets hit all over the place and bats number 10 or 11. I could get nought and nought in Galle. But the likelihood is, I'm in a position to score some runs.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile KP has been transformed, Ian Bell continues to struggle and has scored just 136 runs in 15 innings.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Pietersen said: \"Bell averaged more than 100 last year.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We're all around him, buzzing for him, he is one of the most beautiful batters to watch.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He's world-class and there's nobody who can come in and bat like Ian Bell.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPietersen, 31, is in hot form  much like the weather here.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"This is as hot as I've been on a cricket field. It's a joke. It makes it harder to concentrate. You feel lethargic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I batted for 90 minutes and changed gloves four times.This is a challenge as I batted like a plonker last time here.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I have home and away tons against every country except Sri Lanka and South Africa.
