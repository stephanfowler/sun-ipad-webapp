A voiceover says that on Sunday, Syrian TV channel Addounia broadcast footage of Messi, 24, going on a twisting run before setting up a goal for Pedro against Real Madrid. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt then claims his darting runs were a secret code used by gun runners  and by tracking the direction of the dribbles, passes and shot, it is possible to draw a route into Syria. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAs Messi makes his run, the voiceover states: \"Here we see the first stage where arms are loaded from Lebanon. Then they pass through Homs and are delivered to another terrorist. We also see how they warn that they will face some obstacles until they reach Dayr Al Zawr.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs Pedro's shot hits the net, the voice says: \"Then they are transported by bus to the final destination, located in Al Magadin.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut the jury was out as to whether the Argentinian ace had been unwittingly used in a piece of government brainwashing, rebel propaganda or just a daft hoax. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt would not be the first time state-controlled Addounia made crazy claims. The channel once said a rival station sent coded messages via its weather forecasts. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut Syria experts said the film could also be a bid to smear Syrian tyrant President Bashar al-Assad. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nProf Mark Almond of Oxford University said: \"If I were a Syrian rebel, or someone sympathetic to them, I might make such a video to show the world how silly the Assad regime is.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<a href=\"mailto: l.heighton@the sun.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">l.heighton@the sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","timestamp":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","byline":"By LUKE HEIGHTON","teaser":"WATCH VIDEO: SOCCER ace accused of sending signals  using his DRIBBLING skills","headline":"Riddle of Messi's 'secret signals'","id":4208092,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4208092/Riddle-of-Barca-star-Lionel-Messis-secret-onfield-signals-to-Syria-rebels.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/SNN2111MESS---_1474737a.jpg","subdeck":"Complete dribble ...

A quarter say they are on the roads \"much less\". </p>\n<p>\nThe findings give massive support to The Sun's Keep It Down campaign to win a better deal for hard-pressed motorists.\n</p>\n<p>\nBritain already charges the highest tax on fuel in the European Union, with 60p going straight to the taxman in fuel duty and VAT for every &#163;1 handed over at the pumps. It is 58p for diesel. </p>\n<p>\nWorse is already to come with a 3p hike in fuel duty  ordered by the last Labour government  coming in August. </p>\n<p>\nThat rise alone will mean the monthly petrol bill for a two-car family will go up by &#163;7.69. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile oil prices  currently US$124 per barrel  are likely to rise, with instability in the Middle East set to deepen as troubles over Iran and Syria worsen. </p>\n<p>\nAnd a plan by PM David Cameron and US President Barack Obama to lower them was dealt a blow yesterday. </p>\n<p>\nThe leaders, who met in Washington DC last week, agreed to look at releasing more reserve stocks on to the market. But France and Germany opposed the move, saying it was not yet enough of an emergency.\n</p>\n<p>\nHaving cut fuel duty and frozen rises in his two previous Budgets, the Chancellor appeared to rule out any further action on the issue today. </p>\n<p>\nBut there were new record prices at the pumps yesterday with unleaded averaging 139p per litre and diesel 146p. </p>\n<p>\nOn Budget Day in 2007, petrol cost just 90p a litre and diesel 93p. </p>\n<p>\nAA president Edmund King said: \"At the very minimum the Chancellor must freeze fuel duty. If it goes up, it will affect the economy. It's already meaning people are losing their jobs, reducing their spend, and hindering the economic recovery. </p>\n<p>\n\"Ironically he would make more money if he decided to freeze or reduce the duty as the economy would benefit.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRoad Haulage Association chief Geoff Dunning said another hike in duty would be \"reckless\". </p>\n<p>\nIn a special report, economists last week revealed that a cut in fuel duty of 2.5p per litre would create 175,000 jobs and boost growth. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSpending axe will fund lower <br></br> taxes </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nGEORGE Osborne will today cut overall tax paid by Brits  by ordering more spending cuts. </p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor will take a fresh axe to some ministries' already parlous finances so he can reduce the nation's tax bill by several billions. </p>\n<p>\nThe unexpected move means he will today unveil the first tax-cutting Budget since before the financial crash  delighting Tories. </p>\n<p>\nBut the controversial extra cuts on top of the existing &#163;81billion reduction will spark renewed outrage with Labour and the unions. </p>\n<p>\nAmid a host of major personal tax changes being made today, the lowest earners will be the big winners and the rich will face a painful new soaking. </p>\n<p>\nThe number of poorly-paid workers who pay no income tax will rise to two million thanks to a &#163;1,000 hike in the tax-free earnings threshold to just above &#163;9,100. That will mean tax relief of &#163;200 for low and middle earners in April 2013, on top of the &#163;205 break next month  saving them around &#163;400 a year, as The Sun revealed on Monday. </p>\n<p>\nThere will also be \"substantial\" new tax rises for the rich, a Coalition source said last night. </p>\n<p>\nA new seven per cent top rate of stamp duty will be enforced on houses costing &#163;2million or more. </p>\n<p>\nThe wealthy will see just one cut, with the 50p income tax rate for those on above &#163;150,000 a year brought down to 45p next year. To back this controversial move, Mr Osborne will publish a study by Revenue officials. </p>\n<p>\nIt is expected to reveal returns on the 50p top rate have fallen well short of the &#163;2.7billion forecast when it was introduced by his Labour predecessor Alistair Darling. </p>\n<p>\nRadical action is also expected to simplify the appallingly complicated tax collection system. </p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne will also reaffirm his commitment to the Government's deficit reduction plan, meaning another five more years of austerity. </p>\n<p>\nIn a head-on drive to find growth, the Chancellor will also unveil a massively slimmed-down planning blueprint to speed up new building projects. That will be welcomed by the construction industry but bitterly attacked by countryside campaigners. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nUK is on the grow </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE UK economy may do slightly better this year than had been thought, the Treasury's official forecaster is expected to say today. </p>\n<p>\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to revise 2012's growth estimate upwards from 0.7 per cent to 0.8 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nThe positive news is a sign the green shoots of recovery may be arriving after four years of economic gloom. </p>\n<p>\nFigures yesterday showed inflation fell to 3.4 per cent last month, a .3 per cent drop. </p>\n<p>\nEconomists are projecting consumer spending will grow after higher than expected retail spending at the end of 2011. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nDrink up already... </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE price of whisky, vodka and other spirits soared last month <b>AHEAD</b> of today's Budget. </p>\n<p>\nOfficial inflation figures yesterday showed they leapt 2.6 per cent in February  the biggest ever increase for the month. </p>\n<p>\nExperts blamed price \"resetting\" after New Year discounts  but also the higher cost of grain and transport. </p>\n<p>\nThe Chancellor is expected to add to the pain today by waiving through another duty hike on booze  with pints rising by as much as 10p. </p>\n<p>\nOverall, inflation fell to a 15-month low. The Office of National Statistics put it down to lower gas and electricity bills. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<br></br> by Tom Newton Dunn, Political Editor </h2>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nPREPARE to hear a lot today about changes to personal rates of tax. </p>\n<p>\nThe moment George Osborne sits back down, the spin war will begin. </p>\n<p>\nNot with Labour but from inside the Coalition. </p>\n<p>\nNick Clegg's team have already been at it quietly for months.

I went to see Fabrice last night. I went in and he said 'Hi, doc'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I asked him how he was and he said 'Fine'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Tobin said the player had asked him what had happened. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I explained to him what had happened. That's the sort of level of communication I have had with Fabrice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSpeaking at the hospital in Bethnal Green, East London, he told of his reaction when he first realised the player was in trouble. </p>\n<p>\nHe said all that was going through his head was \"Oh my God, it's Fabrice\". </p>\n<p>\nDr Tobin admitted he broke down in tears in the hospital corridor when the seriousness of what had happened to the player hit home  and added that he had feared the worst. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bhf.org.uk/lifesaving\">JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR CPR IN SCHOOLS BY CLICKING HERE</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Andrew Deaner, the cardiologist and Tottenham fan who leapt from his seat in the crowd and rushed on to the pitch to help the player, said his recovery could be described as \"miraculous\". </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"If you're going to use the term miraculous, I guess it could be used here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Deaner went to visit the player after he had woken up and said that Muamba was able to make a joke even that early on into his recovery process. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I whispered into his ear 'What's your name?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe footballer gave his name. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Deaner went on: \"I said 'I understand you're a very good footballer'. And he said 'I try'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday pals said Fabrice asked why Bolton's FA Cup tie at Spurs had been abandoned  and was told by his dad: \"Because of you.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPals of the Wanderers midfield ace said he had no idea where he was when he came to in a hospital bed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHis father Marcel asked him if he knew who he was. Family friend Aime Esalo revealed: \"Fabrice said 'Yes' and the next thing he asked was, 'Did we lose?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He was told the match was called off while the two teams were drawing 1-1. Fabrice asked why they had stopped it and his father said, 'Because of you'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Esalo told how Muamba, who continued to make encouraging progress yesterday, also asked for his fianc&#233;e Shauna Muganda when he regained consciousness on Monday. </p>\n<p>\nBut the couple's son Joshua, three, was not there. </p>\n<p>\nMuamba, was saved from death by CPR  cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pumping the chest to create artificial blood circulation  given on the pitch during the televised quarter-final tie. </p>\n<p>\nAnd today The Sun is launching a campaign calling for such life-saving skills to become part of the national curriculum in schools, so kids learn how to help in an emergency. </p>\n<p>\nThey should also know sudden cardiac arrests are <b>DIFFERENT</b> from heart attacks. </p>\n<p>\nThe former can occur in the young and healthy if the heart goes into a dangerous rhythm. </p>\n<p>\nHeart attacks are caused by blocked arteries often linked to old age or unhealthy lifestyles. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors said he had been \"very fortunate\" to pull through as fewer than one in five cardiac arrest victims survive and most suffer brain damage. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd Spurs striker Emmanuel Adebayor last night painted a positive picture after visiting Muamba  a former team-mate when both played for Arsenal. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdebayor, who was joined by Chelsea's Michael Essien on a previous visit, said the player was on \"on good form\" and \"back with us again\". He added: \"He's much better, he's talking, he's acting normal. As a brother, as a friend, it is a big relief.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton boss Owen Coyle said he \"managed to exchange a few words\" with Muamba during a visit. He added: \"Fabrice remains critical but there has been improvement. It's still very early and he has a long way to go.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAsked if Muamba could make a full recovery, Coyle replied: \"It has happened before.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe manager was joined at the hospital by Bolton skipper Kevin Davies and several club players. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe team will resume training today and are set to return to Tottenham on Tuesday to replay the Cup tie as long as Muamba continues to recover. </p>\n<p>\nCoyle and Shauna, 27, both thanked legions of well-wishers for their \"incredible\" support. </p>\n<p>\nShauna tweeted: \"Fabrice has felt every single one of your prayers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nReferee Howard Webb, in charge of the Cup game, praised the 35,000-strong crowd for \"almost pushing with the doctor and willing him to get Fabrice's heart going\". Football stars Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones and Bacary Sagna tweeted goodwill messages to Muamba yesterday. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSunderland players wore \"Pray for Muamba\" T-shirts before last night's Premier League game at Blackburn, as did ref Martin Atkinson. Rovers' Yakubu showed off a similar vest when he scored. And in Spain, Barcelona's Lionel Messi showed support with a T-shirt before playing Granada last night. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut amid the hope, Sun doctor Carol Cooper sounded a note of caution. She said: \"It's wrong to expect too much too soon.

What happened made everyone sit up and take notice. </p>\n<p>\nMuamba is the kind of player who roars around the pitch and covers every blade of grass. He has an incredible engine. The effort involved and stress on his heart must have been huge. </p>\n<p>\nIt's horrible to see an athlete as strong as that collapsing on the pitch without warning. </p>\n<p>\nI played 500 or 600 games as a professional footballer and I wouldn't have had a clue how to do CPR. I think I once got 30 minutes training at school. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's a daunting thought for anyone to think they might be faced with a similar situation. </p>\n<p>\nI didn't learn CPR until I filmed the advert for the British Heart Foundation last year. Since the ad was broadcast I've had people coming up to me in the street singing the Stayin' Alive song. We have raised awareness of a serious, serious issue. </p>\n<p>\nThe other day the British Heart Foundation heard about a girl who saved her dad's life by doing CPR after seeing our ad. </p>\n<p>\nLast month an OAP in West London saved his next-door neighbour who suffered a cardiac arrest. He only knew what to do because of the TV campaign. </p>\n<p>\nCPR should be taught in schools as part of the curriculum. </p>\n<p>\nThink about all the amateur football matches around the UK. The Sunday morning pub teams are the ones I consider most at risk. They go out and drink into the small hours and turn up for a kickabout at 10am the next day. Their heart rate is sky high and they're battling through a hangover. It's an accident waiting to happen. </p>\n<p>\nI might have a film coming up with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sly Stallone. Those boys are knocking on a bit.

The Chancellor announced the 50p top rate of tax will drop to 45p from April 2013. </p>\n<p>\nAs he announced the cut to the 50 per cent rate, Osborne also closed a number of loopholes and reliefs which he claimed would raise five times more from the wealthy. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>'Stealth-tax'</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Government stood accused of an \"outrageous stealth tax\" after it emerged that more than four million people who are about to become pensioners will be worse off following changes to simplify the tax system unveiled in the Budget. </p>\n<p>\nAt the moment, people over the age of 65 are not taxed on the first &#163;10,500 of their income, but this will be frozen for existing pensioners - and from next April new pensioners will have a tax-free allowance of only &#163;9,205, bringing them into line with the general population. </p>\n<p>\nAround half of pensioners will be affected by the changes, which will raise around &#163;1billion annually for the Government. </p>\n<p>\nSaga director-general Dr Ros Altmann said: \"This is an outrageous assault on decent middle-class pensioners. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Budget contains an enormous stealth tax for older people. Over the next five years, pensioners with an income of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;24,000 will be paying an extra &#163;3billion in tax while richer pensioners are left unaffected. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing in this Budget for savers, there is nothing to improve the annuity market, nothing to appease the damage of quantitative easing and nothing to support ISA changes and shelter older people's money in cash. This Budget is terrible news for pensioners.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, the basic state pension will be increased by &#163;5.30 a week. </p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne had earlier said the Budget would be good for the UK. \"This Budget rewards work. Britain is going to earn its way in the world.\" he told Parliament. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is no other road to recovery. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Budget supports working families and helps those looking for work. </p>\n<p>\n\"It unashamedly backs business. And it is on the side of aspiration: those who want to do better for themselves and for their families. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Budget re-affirms our unwavering commitment to deal with Britain's record debts.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Government's forecast for UK borrowing for 2011/12 was revised down slightly to &#163;126billion.

The answer, of course, is Messi.\n</p>\n<p>\nRonaldo, for all his superlative stats, is not even part of the conversation.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut that is not because of some conspiracy or propaganda.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is because while Ronaldo rattles them in, goal-machine Messi's Barcelona have been winning the trophies. </p>\n<p>\nIt is because whenever Messi's Barcelona faced Ronaldo's Madrid in any competition they prevailed  apart from the Copa del Rey final last year when the Portugal star headed the extra-time winner. </p>\n<p>\nIt is because this was Real's <b>ONLY</b> win against the Catalans in the four seasons Guardiola has been in charge and the three Ronaldo has been in Madrid.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is because since Ronaldo's arrival Madrid have failed to beat Barcelona in La Liga.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is because the Catalans outclassed Madrid in last year's Champions League semi-final both on and off the pitch.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember Jose Mourinho's Special tactics  more kung-fu than football  to stop Barca playing?\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd his \"why, why, why\" monologue that accused UEFA of pro-Catalan corruption and earned him a four-match ban after Guardiola's men had beaten them 2-0 at the Bernabeu to all but secure their place at Wembley's final?\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is because this year  with Real runaway Liga leaders  Barcelona came to the Bernabeu and won 3-1 staging another exhibition, despite Real's 1st-minute opener through Karim Benzema.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is because when Barcelona went to the Bernabeu a few weeks later in the Copa del Rey they won 2-1 and subsequently dumped Madrid out after a 2-2 draw at the Nou Camp.\n</p>\n<p>\nLast year Ronaldo fired 53 goals in all competitions. Messi stopped at 52 but lifted the Champions League and La Liga while Ronaldo had just the Spanish Cup to show for a splendid season.\n</p>\n<p>\nIronically Ronaldo arrived at the Bernabeu as...the Messiah.\n</p>\n<p>\nI sat in the middle of the pitch with the rest of the world's media as he came out on stage and all I remember are the decibel levels created by 85,000 that had crammed into every corner of the Bernabeu  and the 10,000 locked out around Real's historic stadium.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince then, individually, Ronaldo has produced fireworks to match the fiesta of that balmy July evening in the summer of 2009.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet's not forget even Ronaldo's last game for United was a loss against Messi, who headed the second as Barcelona buried the Red Devils in the Champions League final in Rome.\n</p>\n<p>\nRonaldo arrived at the Bernabeu as the reigning World Player of the Year after scoring 42 goals for United in his penultimate season and winning the Premier and Champions League double (after dumping Barca out in the semis).\n</p>\n<p>\nBut since joining Madrid he has seen Messi win the crown of the world's best player <b>THREE</b> times. Even when Spain won the World Cup Messi was <b>STILL</b> voted the No1 on the planet.\n</p>\n<p>\nRonaldo's character and perseverance must be praised as he has kept going and improving where many would have wilted.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut since he's gone to Madrid he has only won the Spanish Cup.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn that time Messi has won <b>TEN</b> trophies  two Ligas, a Champions League, two European Supercups, two club World Cups and three Spanish Supercups. </p>\n<p>\nIn 11 matches head-to-head, Barcelona have won seven and drawn three while Madrid have only won <b>ONE</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo to answer the question on who I think the world's greatest player is, I have to choose the Argentine.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd that's because Messi scores as many goals and has won many more trophies and almost every Clasico.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fact is Ronaldo has won 10 trophies at the age of 27. Messi has won 18 at the age of 24.\n</p>","timestamp":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 16:41:58 +0000","byline":"<img src=\"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01235/kastrinakis_43x43_1235431a.jpg\"/> By ANTONY KASTRINAKIS, European Football Correspondent","teaser":"ANTONY KASTRINAKIS explains why Lionel Messi pips Cristaino Ronaldo every time","headline":"Ron's the Real deal...but Messi is the world's best","id":4209782,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4209782/Why-Lionel-Messi-pips-Cristiano-Ronaldo-as-worlds-best-footballer.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/LionelMessinew_23__1475153a.jpg","subdeck":"MESSIAH ...

The Argentine genius hit a hat-trick in the 5-3 win over Granada in La Liga. The goals saw the little magician surpass the tally of 232 set by Cesar Rodriguez during his spell at the Catalan club from 1939-1955. Messi's first goal was a crisp half-volley that flew in off the post after good work down the left from youngster Isaac Cuenca. His record-breaker came midway through the second half as he tucked away Dani Alves' through ball. And his treble came from another Alves cross as he struck home from inside the six-yard box, taking his season total to 54. Messi is widely regarded as the finest player of his generation and has been awarded the Ballon D'Or three years in a row. Under the stewardship of boss Pep Guardiola, Messi has become the talisman of the current Barcelona side which is arguably the greatest club team in history. His medal collection  both team and individual  is astonishing and includes five La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. His greatest goal involved a mazy run from inside his own half against Getafe in 2007  reminiscent of fellow countryman Diego Maradona's unforgettable goal against England in the 1986 World Cup. And at such a young age, there's no telling how many he could score  he may even have targeted Pele's mammoth total of more than 1000 goals.","timestamp":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 21:37:13 +0000","byline":"By TOM BARCLAY","teaser":"LIONEL MESSI has broken the all-time goal record for Barcelona  aged just 24","headline":"Messi breaks goal record for Barcelona","id":4207893,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4207893/Lionel-Messi-breaks-goal-record-for-Barcelona-against-Granada.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/messi_1474662a.jpg","subdeck":"MESSIAH ...

Having Cameron has been the making of me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lad is also a brilliant big brother to Luke, ten, Jake, four, Mackenzie, two, and four-month-old Brooklyn. </p>\n<p>\nAs the Down's Syndrome Association runs its awareness campaign this week, courageous Crystal, 27, revealed how Cameron has made her a better person. </p>\n<p>\nAround one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down's and there are 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough the chance of a baby having Down's is higher for older mothers, more babies with Down's are born to younger women  because they have more children. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal fell pregnant at 15 and as the likelihood of having a Down's baby was considered so rare for a mum-to-be of her age, doctors had not even asked if she wanted to be tested. </p>\n<p>\nLike many women, Crystal assumed only older mums had Down's children. She admits when she was first told of her son's diagnosis at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire, she was horrified and ashamed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was still getting my head round the fact he had Down's when three hours after his birth he was whisked off for a scan. </p>\n<p>\n\"When they brought my baby back and told me he had three holes in his heart and would need a major op to fix it, I just fell apart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe devastated teenager sobbed in her mother's arms. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home in Wetherby, West Yorks, sharing a room with her sister and her new tot made life even harder. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I couldn't bear to go out, not because I didn't want to show him off but I was so scared he would die. </p>\n<p>\n\"He seemed so vulnerable and I was way out of my depth. I sobbed myself to sleep every night and kept thinking 'why me?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCameron's dad, 16-year-old Drew, stood by her  visiting the pair regularly. But Crystal was convinced he would leave her. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"All his mates were out clubbing and he was a 16-year-old lad with a baby with Down's.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt three months old Cameron went in for the op to fix the holes in his heart. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal was warned he would be in hospital for up to three months but after just three weeks he was doing so well he was discharged. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home, while most girls her age were out having fun, 16-year-old Crystal was caring for a very sick baby. Then something amazing happened. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Cameron just fought and fought and suddenly I realised it was time to stop feeling sorry for myself. I gave myself a massive boot up the backside. </p>\n<p>\n\"OK, my son wasn't the perfect baby but he was my son and he deserved a mum who would fight for him all the way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDrew and Crystal moved in together and the teen parents learnt Makaton, a language programme using signs and symbols, so they could communicate with Cameron as he grew up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Being able to sign was a major bonus. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Cameron and I formed a remarkable bond and suddenly I realised his disability was anything but.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Crystal fell pregnant with another child when Cameron was just 18 months old, a few friends said she wouldn't be able to cope. </p>\n<p>\nShe was offered a nuchal scan to determine the likelihood of Down's, but turned it down. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I didn't want to know. I coped with Cameron and I knew I'd cope again.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBaby Luke was born healthy, as was Jake two years after. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"The specialists don't know why I had a baby with Down's so young and then it never occurred again. They say it's extremely rare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Cameron was seven, Crystal split from his dad, suddenly finding herself a single mum to three boys. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I'm not saying it was easy but dealing with Cameron gave me the strength to deal with anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Some people close to me thought I would have a breakdown but it was actually Cameron that kept me going. </p>\n<p>\n\"He developed this really cheeky, funny personality. He had me in stitches and when I was down he seemed to sense it and would give me a cuddle. He's just so happy I couldn't be sad around him.\" </p>\n<p>\nCrystal has since found love with 21-year-old shop worker Darren Hooper. The couple have two sons. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Life's good. Cameron goes to a special needs school which he loves and has really boosted his speech and learning. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll admit that when I first heard my little boy had Down's I reached the depths of despair but now I don't see him as a boy with problems. </p>\n<p>\n\"I see him for what he is  an unbelievably loving little boy who loves cuddles and has tons of affection and love to give. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I know people thought I didn't have the maturity to cope but having Cameron has been the making of me.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Crystal has high hopes for Cameron's future: \"I would love him to move out of home, get a job, marry and go on to have his own family one day and there's no reason why he can't achieve any of those dreams. </p>\n<p>\n\"Cameron has ambitions like any boys his age. He loves playing sports and listening to Lady GaGa. </p>\n<p>\n\"He tells me he wants to be a footballer one day and I tell him he should aim high and go for it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Every child, no matter if they have Down's syndrome, should be given a chance to prove what they can do and lead as ordinary a life as possible.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSarah offers other parents hope </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nDOWN'S syndrome actress Sarah Gordy is proof that people with disabilities can lead a full and rewarding life. </p>\n<p>\nThe 34-year-old  who plays Lady Pamela on BBC drama Upstairs Downstairs  has starred in many TV shows and plays. And her mum Jane, 63, could not be more proud of her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jane, speaking about discovering her first-born had Down's syndrome, admitted: \"Being completely honest, if I was given a test and told my baby had Down's I would have considered a termination. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'd have been terrified about not being able to look after her. But that saddens me now. </p>\n<p>\n\"When I fell pregnant I wasn't ready to be a mum. In my 20s at the time, I'd never changed a nappy so I felt very unprepared. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Sarah was born I couldn't believe how beautiful she was.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane didn't have any tests for Down's syndrome because she was under 28 when she fell pregnant. But the paediatrician noticed Sarah had the condition from the moment he saw her. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"Calling my husband Jerry aside, he told him that Sarah had the condition. Not only that, but he asked him not to tell me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He said it was important for me to form a bond with Sarah first. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking back I don't know how poor Jerry kept it to himself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt wasn't until four days later that Jane found out. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was heartbroken and terrified I would lose my baby. He kept telling me about potential heart problems and operations she'd need. </p>\n<p>\n\"But finding out turned me from a girl into a fully-fledged mother.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily, Sarah didn't need any operations. Jane said: \"I wish I knew back then what I know now, about how much of an amazing life she'd have.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane had another daughter, Catherine, now 32, 16 months after Sarah and admits she felt relief when tests showed she did not have Down's. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"I just didn't know if having two children with the condition would be too much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wish parents-to-be were provided with more information about Down's syndrome before they make a decision about termination. </p>\n<p>\n\"No one should ever feel pressured either way, but it's such a difficult decision to make without knowing exactly what it will entail.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile everything took longer with Sarah, Jane says she soon realised her daughter had an incredible ability to feel what other people feel. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"If I'm ever stressed or worried and I tell Sarah I'm fine she will say, 'No you're not,' and I have to come clean. We're very close as no emotion goes unnoticed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Jane explains that Down's syndrome actors work very differently to those without the condition. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The interesting thing about Sarah is she doesn't really act. She feels very emotional on set. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't fake emotion, so instead she believes everything about her character. </p>\n<p>\n\"Once she was acting as an abused wife and I saw how much the abusive words were hurting her. </p>\n<p>\n\"When she came off set I said, 'Sarah  you're a beautiful, successful actress' and she slowly remembered that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to think that Sarah being successful on TV gives parents who are expecting a Down's syndrome child strength and confidence that their child can lead a really healthy life.\"\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL BOYS, Chief Executive at Down's Syndrome Association</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWE have seen great improvements in the lives of people with Down's syndrome since the association's formation in 1970. </p>\n<p>\nToday, the average life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome is 60 to 65 years, compared to 35 to 40 back in 1970.

Sick of her unhealthy lifestyle and size 18 waist, Linda decided to ditch booze for good. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I was stuck in a destructive routine of drinking and eating too much. </p>\n<p>\nI'd just broken up with my boyfriend and wanted to move on. I'd read about the LighterLife diet and wanted to give it a go. </p>\n<p>\nOvernight I gave up alcohol and started eating four food packs a day, containing 5-600 calories. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a complete shock to the system and the first week was really hard, but I knew it would be worth it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI used to drink a bottle of wine most nights, on Fridays I'd have work drinks and Saturdays I'd be out drinking with non-work friends. </p>\n<p>\nSundays were spent recovering. It was relentless. Drinking with clients and colleagues was part of my life and I'd got myself into really bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only after I gave it up I noticed what a big impact it had. </p>\n<p>\nNow after a work night out I'll come into the office whistling and full of energy, while my colleagues are often a step behind me. And I remember all the office gossip! </p>\n<p>\nIt's been five months now and I feel stronger, more confident and I have more energy than ever before. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from 14st 9lb to 12st, from a size 18-16 to a size 14-12  and I know I look as good as I feel. </p>\n<h1>\nLaura Coventry, 33 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDDING photographer Laura, from Glasgow, went teetotal two years ago after bingeing on boozy nights out left her with huge memory blanks. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most girls in their twenties and thirties I lived for the weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThe prospect of partying and heavy drinking got me through the working week and I'd wish away Monday to Friday. </p>\n<p>\nI drank a lot, not just a couple of glasses of wine, but enough to get seriously drunk. I just loved the euphoria and the buzz that it gave me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd suffer terrible hangovers, I'd regularly be in bed until 5pm with headaches and feeling sick, but I saw it as a price worth paying to let my inhibitions go. </p>\n<p>\nOn occasions I'd been out with friends, woken up with a shocking hangover  and realised there were huge blanks in my night out I couldn't remember. </p>\n<p>\nIt really scared me and for the first time I questioned why I was doing this to myself. I knew I had to change. </p>\n<p>\nThe first two weeks were the hardest, but I managed the first three-month goal I set myself, then extended that to six months. </p>\n<p>\nNow not one drop of booze has passed my lips since February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nSome friends want me to start going out drinking with them again and say that I've proven my point, but I'm determined not to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI have a fantastic new boyfriend now and I wake up on Mondays smiling, something which never happened before. </p>\n<p>\nI still party but I don't need alcohol to get a buzz. Life feels so much fuller and better. </p>\n<h1>\nLucy Troughton, 31 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>IT was last October when Lucy went teetotal after realising the damaging effect alcohol was having on her mood. The waitress, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI lived in London between the ages of 19 to 22 and I was out drinking socially most nights. But when I fell pregnant at 23 I didn't drink for the best part of a year. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not that I missed it but I still felt very young to be stuck at home, not out partying like I used to. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a band so drinking was almost expected of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of my friends didn't have kids so there was always someone around to go out drinking with. I soon reverted back to weekend drinking. </p>\n<p>\nI got stuck in a rut of Mondays being a write-off, like I was waiting for the day to finish the moment I woke up. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to be on form for my daughter Grace, now seven, but I was tired and only realised when it was too late that I was becoming depressed. </p>\n<p>\nIn mid-October last year I decided enough was enough and gave up alcohol completely. </p>\n<p>\nIt was, and still is, very hard. I didn't go out and became a bit of a recluse, focusing more on my music, gardening and reading. </p>\n<p>\nIt's had a huge effect and I really love the mornings now. </p>\n<p>\nI feel so clear-headed. And people often comment on how I'm 'glowing' now. </p>\n<p>\nThe idea of a glass of wine with a meal is still a temptation but it does get easier to say \"No\". </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal has taught me what I really value. And I'm happier than ever. </p>\n<h1>\nKatie Carr, 22 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BARMAID Katie from Bridlington, East Yorks, was a beer-swilling, pizza-scoffing ladette. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She went teetotal in July 2010 after binge drinking caused her to have a seizure and a new love interest persuaded her to transform her life. Katie says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTequila, sambuca, J&#228;gerbombs  I wasn't fussy. I could get through 20 pints of lager in a night. </p>\n<p>\nIn June 2010, I'd been fired from my job as a waitress for consistently turning up to work reeking of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree weeks later, I'd spent &#163;1,200 in my local pub. I put on nine stone in a year on a diet of booze and pizza, weighed 18.5st and was a size 22. I didn't wear make-up or dress girly. </p>\n<p>\nOne night in July, I was out with friends when I had a seizure in a nightclub. </p>\n<p>\nI was carried out by a bouncer and taken to hospital by ambulance. The doctor instructed me to stop drinking for six weeks while they ran tests. </p>\n<p>\nWhile I was sober, I had time to re-evaluate who I was. </p>\n<p>\nWanting to seize the day, I contacted the bouncer and asked him, \"When are you going to take me out?\". I was amazed when he said later that week. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the CT scans came back clear  I'd just drunk too much. I've not been back on the booze since and have now lost eight stone. </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal is one of the best things I've ever done. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from ladette to lady. </p>\n<h1>\nRebecca Spencer, 35 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE charity worker from Southend, Essex, went teetotal seven years ago after a charity trip shocked her into a lifestyle change. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2003 I moved to London from Newcastle in search of a new job. </p>\n<p>\nI had a big group of friends and we used to go out every weekend and always drank a lot of vodka. It was just something we did and I didn't see it as a problem. </p>\n<p>\nIn 2005 I embarked on a charity trip with Help The Aged to India to photograph how people were rebuilding their lives after the 2004 tsunami. </p>\n<p>\nIt was the most eye-opening, inspiring and horrendous experience, all at the same time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe destruction was overpowering and having an alcoholic drink in that context seemed completely ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nThe experience changed my values and made me completely reassess myself. </p>\n<p>\nJust a few days after being in India I was in Covent Garden surrounded by young professionals knocking back drinks without a thought. </p>\n<p>\nI'd seen people with absolutely nothing and I decided to re-focus my life on the things that counted. Alcohol seemed such a self-destructive extravagance. </p>\n<p>\nAs soon as I gave up I realised I'd never even really liked the taste of alcohol  it was just the social side of it I enjoyed. </p>\n<p>\nNine months after the charity trip I fell pregnant and later had my son. </p>\n<p>\nI felt great and no part of me wanted to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI've been teetotal for seven years now and feel healthier, more energetic and have much more in my pocket  why go back? </p>","timestamp":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"INCREASING numbers of people are binning alcohol  here five women reveal what it's like to live without booze","headline":"Why we're all tee totally happy","id":4205741,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/SNF20BOOZE--_1474058a.jpg","subdeck":"On the wagon ...

Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

It appears to have a pretty instant effect that lasts for about 30 minutes per cigarette. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The stronger the nicotine content, the greater this metabolism-boosting effect. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Smoking also seems to help to suppress the appetite. It does this in part by helping to block the action of chemicals in the brain that stimulate hunger. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But it is important to put things into perspective and to appreciate that, although some people do put on a lot of weight after quitting cigarettes, the average gain is between three and ten pounds. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The good news is that some experts report that using nicotine patches helps to lower appetite, and that those who use them while trying to quit gain less weight than those who do not. Having regular 'doses' of carbohydrate may also help to beat the hunger pangs which may be triggered by quitting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"And on the day you decide to give up, make sure you have breakfast and keep up this habit. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Not having anything to eat first thing can be a real problem because, by mid-morning, your body will not only be craving its usual nicotine fix but will also have low blood sugar. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is important when giving up smoking to remember that, even though cigarettes appear to help a bit in the battle of the bulge, there are plenty of slim people who do not smoke and plenty of overweight people who do smoke. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Continuing to smoke because you think giving up will make you fat is no excuse not to try quitting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Doing so could well save your life.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<b>5 point weight proof plan</b>\n</h2>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1. </b>Don't give up when you are tired. Being tired always makes you more hungry. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>2. </b>Throw out fattening foods that might tempt you. If you can't do this, put them in a cupboard away from day-to-day foods so you are not constantly seeing them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>3.</b> Stock up on healthy snacks such as satsumas, grapes, low-fat yogurts, small 30g servings of nuts like almonds, cashews and peanuts and some miniature dark-chocolate Green &amp; Black's bars that you can nibble on when the nicotine withdrawal triggers hunger pangs. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.</b> Drink at least six to eight cups or mugs of fluids each day to help keep hydrated. Being dehydrated can make you stressed and grumpy. It is not a good idea to try to quit caffeine-containing drinks at the same time as giving up cigarettes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>5.</b> Eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a small snack in between to ensure that levels of sugar in your blood are steady and stable. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEggs on toast, cereal or fruit salad and yogurt make good breakfasts. </p>\n<p>\nTuna, chicken or hummus-stuffed pitta or wraps are examples of energy-extending lunches and spaghetti Bolognese, baked potato with baked-bean toppings, stir fries and omelettes make good dinners. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>How exercise can help</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>NICKI SAYS: </b>\"A new study has discovered that vigorous exercise can have a positive impact on the success rate of women trying to give up smoking. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"This is exciting news, especially when combined with previous research that shows exercising for one to two hours a week while quitting also significantly reduces the amount of weight gained. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"By incorporating exercise into your quitting programme, the feelgood endorphins your body produces also help you to overcome the mood swings that come with quitting.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nTips to give up smoking </h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b><br></br>Commit to daily exercise sessions during the first month of quitting. </b>Preferably in the morning to perk your mood up for the day ahead. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSign up to classes, if you can, to keep you on track and schedule in things like swimming and cycling. If you prefer, a fast 30-minute walk, skipping or working out to a DVD at home all count. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nExercise can help to relieve stress, making it the ideal antidote to tense moments during the day, which can otherwise leave you reaching for the ciggies. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Work out what your cigarette triggers are.</b> If you reach for one when you pick up the phone, walk up and down the stairs instead while chatting. Or if you can, go outside and talk while you walk. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIf your trigger is when you relax in front of the telly, stop watching and try skipping indoors or, again, go for a walk to distract you. Work out your own problem moments and plan ahead to avoid them by replacing them with something active. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Define your goals. </b>If you don't have a specific goal, your training will lack direction. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nTo help support your goals, look for programmes that match your needs. For example, if you're running a race to raise money for charity, most charities provide training programmes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nOr, try one of the many fitness apps  Nike Training Club, for instance, is free to download. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Keep a training diary. </b>Once you've worked out your training programme, it's important to keep a record of your workouts in a diary. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe easiest, quickest way to log details is to develop a code for the type and length of workout you do. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIt also means you can add up your total number of exercise minutes each week. Aim to increase what you do until you have reached four to six hours a week. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Stop boredom creeping in. </b>One of the biggest reasons we fall out of love with fitness is getting stuck in a rut. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nWhy not try inline skating or join a sports team? Aim to do at least two different types of cardiovascular exercise a week, whether it's running, cycling or swimming. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThis keeps your body challenged and mind engaged. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAny activity that focuses your mind will ensure you use your body more effectively so you'll get better results. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nIdeal activities include martial arts such as t'ai chi, karate, capoeira or yoga and Pilates. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Get a big exercise high. </b>There's nothing like a high-intensity workout to give you an exercise high and get you wanting more. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nResearch shows intense bouts of exercise release more feelgood hormones and get you fitter quicker.

I don't remember her ever saying, \"Wouldn't you be pretty if you did this or that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe never focused on anything beyond wanting me to be presentable  just well-groomed.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe wanted me to take care of myself and be healthy. </p>\n<p>\nShe did ask one or two questions when I became a cheerleader at high school because I would be teasing my hair and wearing lipstick and eyeliner. </p>\n<p>\nI have an affiliation with a lot of countries. My mum was from Norway, my dad from Switzerland and my grandmother was Finnish, I have an Italian uncle, my first love was from South Africa and I was born in Texas.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am definitely a Texan girl. It is a culture you really love in a Latin sort of way. You taste it and hear it and the climate is hot  Texas hot.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI felt lucky that my parents were European  different  and opened the doors to let me see America is not the centre of the universe. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant that, with Bridget Jones, I could go to London and enjoy all things English that make the country so wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the making of the first film, I was even whistling songs by the Spice Girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my mum was a realist about bringing up a teenage girl in America and kept a sense of humour. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me that there are consequences for the things you say and do. She wanted me to grow up to be a good person. She and Dad liked simple and quiet. We had a very quiet house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mum didn't talk about her childhood growing up in Norway during the Second World War. Her sisters talked but all had difficulty in putting into words what they had seen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey told about women giving birth in tunnels because there was no safe haven in any other structure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd about being lost from family members and not being sure if they were alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it was different for me, from my friends, growing up in a house where your mother was grateful just to have peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was one thing which was never acceptable, though.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I said: \"I don't know how to do that\", she would say: \"Learn.\" </p>\n<p>\nShe encouraged me to get a college education (Renee has an English degree) as something to fall back on if acting didn't work out.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved to Los Angeles on December 6, 1993, to be exact.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy attitude was that I was going to see where it took me.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been working in Texas from the age of 21, and been in a couple of films. But I had pretty well exhausted my learning opportunities. </p>\n<p>\nSo I took a grungy little one-bed apartment and was scared to death of the future. It was a leap of faith, I guess. </p>\n<p>\nI had some friends in LA who I had met on films but inside and emotionally, I felt alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make a living, I worked in a bar called The Three Cubs on a street called Vine, behind the Mobil gas station.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was an incredible place for a girl like me, who had lived in relatively safe places all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were crack deals being done on the street corners  so I would come back from the bar late at night then not be able to get out of my car to my apartment until the deals were completed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked at the bar for two years. That was why Mum's guidance was so important and I stayed happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you can take care of yourself and see your friends, that is all that matters. </p>\n<p>\nThe main difference that the film Jerry Maguire made in my life was I could pay my rent and didn't have to waitress any more. It gave me freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew from the start that if I failed in acting, I always had my degree and could try a million things. I was not a \"look at me\" kind of girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had gravitated toward acting because I had a vivid imagination and daydreamed a lot. </p>\n<p>\nBut I did not daydream about being on a film set, winning an Oscar or having people know my name.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for the fact my mum never worried that I would compromise myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was always telling me, 'You don't sit down enough'  but she learned to trust my instincts.\n</p>","timestamp":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"ACTRESS Renee Zellweger reveals how her Norwegian mother influenced her career","headline":"Renee's European parents","id":4203467,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4203467/Renee-Zellweger-America-is-not-the-centre-of-the-universe.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01473/Renee_Zellweger--5_1473337a.jpg","subdeck":"Different perspective ...

I was unhealthily skinny. </p>\n<p>\n\"After meeting my boyfriend I started gaining weight. </p>\n<p>\n\"We went out eating and drinking and this became our social life together. </p>\n<p>\n\"That was when I started to gain weight. It was creeping on and, by September 2005 when I was 21, I weighed 18st 7lb. </p>\n<p>\n\"I began work on the reception in a Chinese takeaway and started to eat takeaway food at least three times a week. </p>\n<p>\n\"But I didn't just have Chinese. There were also McDonald's, pizza and kebabs. I would eat any kind of takeaway. </p>\n<p>\n\"This bad habit of eating junk came from laziness and the fact I was working evenings and training to be a nurse. </p>\n<p>\n\"My boyfriend couldn't cook and I didn't want to, so it was easier to grab and go. </p>\n<p>\n\"We would do no exercise, watch films on TV, have a takeaway and then go to bed. </p>\n<p>\n\"One day the realisation of my obesity hit me like a lead weight. </p>\n<p>\n\"I couldn't fit the clothes in normal dress shops and I was very uncomfortable.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p>\nWanting to lose weight instantly, Holly tried a crash diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I went on a liquid diet and in six months I had shot down to 11st 4lb. </p>\n<p>\n\"But the diet was awful, my hair was falling out and I was bruising from head to toe. </p>\n<p>\n\"I realised how unhealthy I was and I started to eat normal food again in March 2006. </p>\n<p>\n\"But by September 2009 I had gained a staggering 11st. I had gone back to eating takeaways and secret eating too. </p>\n<p>\n\"I would secretly eat anything I could get my hands on  crisps, cakes, biscuits and bars and bars of chocolate. </p>\n<p>\n\"My diet was terrible, I was eating easily 6,000 calories a day. </p>\n<p>\n\"Breakfast would be five slices of toast with peanut butter and five Weetabix. Lunch would be two cheese toasties and a McDonald's, and dinner would be pizza and chips. I would also snack on a packet of crumpets a day, two pork pies and a packet of six cakes. I became compulsive. I was unhappy with my job in insurance, after I gave up nursing, and food became an obsession. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I was eating to numb my feelings of unhappiness.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"At my heaviest, in September 2009, I weighed a staggering 22st 9lb, and was wearing a size 28 dress. I went on holiday with my friends and on the airplane I had to ask for an extension on my seatbelt. </p>\n<p>\n\"And I was not allowed on a waterpark ride because I didn't fit on it. It was all so mortifying. </p>\n<p>\n\"Two months later I separated from my partner of ten years and was devastated. </p>\n<p>\n\"A couple of months later my ex and I had a one-night stand and I fell pregnant. </p>\n<p>\n\"Though we'd had our problems, we wanted to keep the baby. I was so, so happy.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut sadly, at 12 weeks, Holly miscarried. She says: \"I lost the baby three days before my first scan. I was shell-shocked and heart-broken. It hit me like a brick as I realised I may have lost the baby because I was so overweight. The gynaecologist said to me afterwards that excess weight can cause miscarriage. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I did a lot of research on the internet and came to my own conclusion that I did miscarry because of my weight. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was at this point I thought, 'Holly, you have got to sort yourself out.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nHolly and her boyfriend separated properly and she spent the next 16 months living a healthy lifestyle and again lost weight. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I started being careful with my food and calorie counting. </p>\n<p>\n\"I started drinking two litres of water every day with green tea and redbush tea. </p>\n<p>\n\"I also kept a food diary to keep me motivated. </p>\n<p>\n\"There were lots of small things that I changed in my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"I stopped driving to the shops, started going for long walks in my lunch hour, taking the stairs instead of the lift and jogging. </p>\n<p>\n\"I couldn't afford the gym so I took exercise where I could and when it was free. </p>\n<p>\n\"After 16 months I was delighted when I stepped on the scales and saw that I had lost 11st and size 12 clothes fitted me comfortably. I had lost an incredible eight dress sizes. </p>\n<p>\n\"My friends and family have helped me no end with my new healthy lifestyle. </p>\n<p>\n\"My little sister <i>(drama teacher Chelsea Francis, 24)</i> has filled my new wardrobe and has given me bags and bags of clothes.

I treat her as often as I can and when Mother's Day comes around I try and do something a little extra special. </p>\n<p>\n\"This coming Mother's Day I know that my two boys will wake me up with breakfast in bed, it's usually burnt toast and a luke warm cup of tea, and it will be the best breakfast I'll have all year! </p>\n<p>\n\"I know we'll have a lovely family day but for many mothers around the world they won't be comforted by those certainties, they have no idea how their day will begin or how it will end. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll be thinking of these mums this Mothers Day who'll be fighting to save their child's life, desperately trying to find enough food so that their child can survive Mother's Day, and then the next day and every day after that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sure you've seen in the news, as I have, that more than a million children across both East and West Africa are at risk of dying over the coming months if they do not receive more help soon. </p>\n<p>\n\"UNICEF, the world's leading children's organisation, is already there with local partners to try and help children and their families before its too late, but they urgently need more funds to be able to do this. </p>\n<p>\n\"As a mum, all you want to do is protect and provide for your family, I can't begin to feel how desperate, frustrated and anxious these mums must be all the time without any food to feed their children. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have travelled to East Africa and I found the sight of malnourished children heartbreaking. I talked to some of these kids and was shocked to hear how little they ate on a daily basis. </p>\n<p>\n\"I find it almost impossible to imagine that with a supermarket on every corner and all the food I could want, that around the world every hour, 300 children are still dying from hunger. </p>\n<p>\n\"Just think, by the time you've read this paper, had a cup of tea and phoned your mum, another 300 children will have died, just because they don't have enough to eat. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Mother's Day, it's not about feeling guilty for what you've got, or feeling like you can't be spoilt. Of course you can. It's just about taking a moment to remember these mums and their children who won't be celebrating this year, and do your bit to help them. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm doing my bit by supporting UNICEF's Mother's Day campaign and you can too. </p>\n<p>\n\"UNICEF is calling on everyone to buy a Nutritional Inspired Gift, which are life saving food supplies delivered directly to the mums and the children that need it most, like those in West Africa. </p>\n<p>\n\"My favourite is a special high protein paste  Plumpy Nut - which can take a child from the brink of death to healthy in a matter of weeks.

That set me on the road of starvation for a few years.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow the singer, whose<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3966624/All-7-are-up-for-S-Club-reunion-tour.html\"> 22-date comeback tour with Steps</a> starts on April 2, refuses to bow to that sort of pressure. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I have spent so many years starving myself to be skinny. You can damage yourself by doing that  and I probably have in some ways. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think it's really sad that there is so much emphasis on a woman's size, certainly in the music industry. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not really fair, and it doesn't make your average woman feel that great about herself. It makes you feel low. </p>\n<p>\n\"You are being told by magazines that you shouldn't look like that, you should be skinny  and that's just not the way it is. </p>\n<p>\n\"Being a size 16 doesn't mean you don't look good. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You are brainwashed into thinking you can't wear nice clothes because you are a little bigger and you have to wear baggy stuff to hide whatever's going on underneath  and it's rubbish. </p>\n<p>\n\"<a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3649513/Three-big-but-beautiful-Sun-readers-bravely-copy-Claire-Richards-nude-pose.html\" target=\"_blank\">I'm a size 14 to 16 and I have a waist</a>, I have boobs and I have a bum. I can accentuate those assets and still wear a nice dress and feel good about myself. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is important to remember that a size 16 is the average size of a woman in the UK. It is odd how these women are made to feel like they are not the norm but they are.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the height of her fame with Steps Claire starved herself to a size eight before <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/2894718/Steps-star-Claire-Richards-weighs-15-stone-following-her-second-pregnancy-but-shes-in-no-rush-to-trim-down.html\" target=\"_blank\">becoming a size 20 when the band split </a>in 2001. Her weight has fluctuated ever since. </p>\n<p>\nShe said of the latest criticism: \"The stories circulating about me struggling with dance moves are complete rubbish. </p>\n<p>\n\"I don't know where that has come from. Maybe someone has thought, 'Oh, she's bigger than the others so she must be struggling'. It's not an issue. It is just one of those things. People have just got to be nasty sometimes. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am putting in as much work and effort as everybody else. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is tough  it's a two-hour show, dancing for pretty much the whole thing. Just because I am a bigger size, I am no less fit than anybody else. It's cr*p. </p>\n<p>\n\"You can run every day and be fit and then be put in the situation that we are all in and you are using muscles you didn't even know you had. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not as simple as someone being fit and someone not being fit  or someone being a size 16 and someone being a size 8. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's all going well. I don't know if it's because I'm a bit older now but I seem to be much more focused and picking up choreography better than I ever did. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not a trained dancer so that was always something I struggled with. Now we are just making sure it all looks perfect. I am in the middle of rehearsals at the moment, so it is a bit manic but really good.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClaire admits the interest in her size is something she has got used to. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The obsession with my size gets on my nerves a lot less now than it used to. I am happy with the way I am.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClaire lives in Middlesex with her hubby Reece, 43, an electrician and their children, Charlie, four, and two-year-old Daisy. </p>\n<p>\nShe added: \"My husband loves me, my kids love me and nobody I am working with thinks it's an issue. If I look out into that audience when I'm up on stage with Steps, at least there will be women out there just like me who will feel a bit better about themselves because I am not a size 8. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am not trying to make a stand about my figure  but I've been a size 8 and I was miserable. I probably could have gone down to that size again  but what's the point if you are not going to be that for ever? </p>\n<p>\n\"I don't want to be yo-yoing any more  and if that means I'll just be a bit bigger, that's just the way it's got to be. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not like I am starting out now. Steps wouldn't be the same if I wasn't in it, so they can't say to me now, 'You have to lose weight otherwise you can't be in the group'. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is no way anyone could tell me I'm too big or I have to lose weight now  because they can't do the tour without me. </p>\n<p>\n\"As a group, we always said if one of us didn't want to do it, then it wouldn't happen. They are certainly not going to kick me out for being a size 16.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClaire is also hosting Lorraine's Cake Club, a search on Sun columnist Lorraine Kelly's ITV show to find Britain's best cake. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the singer reckons most online comments and tweets about her are supportive. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I would say that 95 per cent of people are saying, 'I think she looks great'. </p>\n<p>\n\"From doing the TV show Slave To Food last year about the kind of trouble I have had to deal with about my weight, I was surprised by the response I got. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had people saying, 'Thank you, you are so brave for doing that show. I can now look at a person on telly and say that she is just like me'. </p>\n<p>\n\"Many women have said to me, 'Hearing you talk about this stuff is like looking in the mirror.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There aren't many of us out there who will be honest and say, 'I struggle with my weight'. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I don't really want to struggle any more, so this is me  and if you don't like it, tough.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b><a href=\"mailto:n.watkins@the-sun.co.uk\">n.watkins@the-sun.co.uk </a></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Claire's changing body </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"></h2>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>1999 </b> size 8, 8st 7Ib<b> </b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2005  </b>size 16, 13st </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2008  </b>size 18, 15st </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2008  </b>size 10, 10st 7Ib </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2009  </b>size 18, 15st </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2011 </b> size 14-16, 12st </p>","timestamp":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 00:20:00 +0000","byline":"By NIKKI WATKINS","teaser":"STEPS star Claire Richards on why she will never starve herself to be skinny again","headline":"Richards: I'm proud to be size 16","id":4198372,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01471/SNF16STEP7-_1471646a.jpg","subdeck":"Curvy ...

It will soon be rolled out nationally. </p>\n<p>\nMichael, from Batley, West Yorkshire, says: \"If this had been in place in time for Clare then I'm certain she would still be alive today. </p>\n<p>\n\"She would have realised the danger she was in and come home to her dad, where I would have been able to protect her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Clare first introduced Appleton to her father, he was instantly concerned. He says: \"As soon as he walked through the door I didn't like him. Alarms bells started ringing  somehow I knew he was bad.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut gradually Michael, a retired policeman, accepted the relationship. </p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"As her dad my role wasn't to interfere. It was always to be waiting in the background to pick up the pieces if things went wrong.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nClare, who was living in Salford, ended the relationship in October 2008, much to Michael's relief. He recalls: \"I asked why but she never gave me a proper answer. Then at Christmas she said she'd had to report him to the police for being a pest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClare didn't tell her dad about the sexual assaults and violence that Appleton had inflicted on her during their relationship. Michael adds: \"She never got into any trouble or bother, not even as a child. When she was a kid I always told her that the first time she brought the police to the door she would be grounded. </p>\n<p>\n\"She never did  at least not until the day they came to tell me she was dead. It was unthinkable something so gruesome could have happened to my own child.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSix days later Appleton was found hanged and Michael adds: \"There was an element of relief that it was finished now.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the months that followed Michael discovered what a monster Clare had been dating. </p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"I found out that four crime numbers had been assigned to my daughter regarding this man  including physical abuse and attempted rape. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"It came out that he'd been in prison for harassment and holding an ex at knifepoint. </p>\n<p>\n\"I couldn't believe this information hadn't been passed on to Clare when she first reported him. At that point there were three non-harassment orders in situ to different girls. </p>\n<p>\n\"If Clare had been made aware of this she would have known he was capable of anything. The police let her down.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow Michael is determined that Clare's Law will be easily accessible to girls like Clare. </p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"This is so women can make informed decisions about their own safety. </p>\n<p>\n\"If Clare's death can stop even a handful more girls being killed then I'll have some comfort. I will have achieved something good out of something truly terrible.\"\n</p>","timestamp":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","teaser":"HEARTBROKEN father Michael Brown's three-year campaign finally triumphs","headline":"'Clare's Law will protect women'","id":4197997,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4197997/Clares-Law-Michael-Browns-campaign-to-allow-women-to-know-if-partner-violent-to-be-rolled-out.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01471/SNF16WOM2A--_1471575a.jpg","subdeck":"Murdered ...

This brain activation gives us butterflies in the stomach, feelings of euphoria, etc. -what we label Love Sickness. </p>\n<p>\nYou don't want to have to ring a doc but to stimulate a little Love Sickness in that special person here are 'his and hers' guides. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For her: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*New research shows a lower + slower tone of voice attracts his interest. You might have a complete laugh with your girlfriends but when you meet Mr. Potential slow it down, chill it out. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Give yourself as slim a waistline as possible with fashion tricks - belts, 'body cons', darker colours at the mid-line, etc. Subconsciously men are attracted to a slim waistline that signals youth and fertility. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Science shows large 'doe' eyes set high in the cheeks will attract him at a subconscious level [he can't quite put a finger on what makes you so alluring]. It's worth investing in fabulous false eyelashes. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Stand so your body forms a natural 'S' shape known to naturally attract his attention. Have one leg slightly further out making that hip dip slightly. The other hip naturally rises slightly higher = very feminine curve. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Most men get annoyed when you repeatedly flick your hair but it's the opposite with an occasional slow stroke down the side of your head - seen as sensual. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Use the age-old trick of attracting his eye-line to your cleavage with a pendant or with your fingertips as you chat. This gives him a subconscious signal a your attraction - you want him to notice your femininity. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*If things are heating up and you really fancy him slide your fingers up and down your drink glass slowly. This signals definite attraction. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*If he's unsure whether you're interested give a simple touch to his forearm when chatting to him - subtly signals your interest. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For him: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*Be a 'doer' - women are attracted to action so don't sit back being shy and quiet. When you make a move, go over, say hello, etc., you immediately score lots of points even if at first you're not her physical type. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Chat her up at the gym as research shows fresh sweat attracts women - note the key word is fresh. So straight after a class say hello don't hang around while your sweat gets stale. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*The female eye notices the classic V-shape of a man's shoulders - usually broader than the hips. So if you're not muscled up top, use the right clothing to bulk out your shoulders. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*As with vocal tone for women [above] you signal confidence with a slower deeper tone. Even if your stomach is somersaulting with nerves keep that voice calm and controlled. </p>\n<p>\n<b>* If you haven't met yet and you're standing, e.g., at a bar where she can notice you, either casually rest your hand on your hip or loop a finger through your belt loop. At a subconscious level this is a display to her of your masculinity - or your man-package. It's very primal! </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*If you're crossing a room to make contact slow your pace and try and add a little bit of swagger - don't go over the top with a big alpha male display. Subconsciously women notice the masculinity of a man's walk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Women often worry [sometimes rightly] a man's only after one thing. At a subtle level she'll notice if you start 'mirroring' her body language as you chat. This signals genuine interest rather than a shallow one - heaven forbid you'd have to shallow intentions!

Footie team wins? Celebratory sex is on the menu. Footie team loses? It's consolatory sex to cheer him up. Best mate's birthday? Wey-hey, carry on the party at home and so on. </p>\n<p>\nBecause of this pressure men can feel completely useless when they lose sexual interest. Hey, where did it go? they wonder as they search high and low...um, nothing's happening in my boxers, nothing's happening when I wake up, or when she wears her special knickers, etc. </p>\n<p>\nOf course we women decide it must be us - we're not attractive enough anymore. He feels useless, she feels unattractive = not very good for the sex life. </p>\n<p>\nMen lose their va-va-va-voom for as many different reasons as women do - stress at work, not looking after themselves, rows between you two. But it can also be down to TDS - testosterone deficiency syndrome. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.17:</b> Students must let each other know when they're worried about not having sex. Stewing in silence is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough TDS usually strikes the over-50s it also hits many younger men especially from age 35 onwards. Not only do they lose interest in sex and find their erections aren't as powerful but they might feel they're less energetic generally and be more forgetful. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Begin by getting up the courage to speak to each other. You'll both feel so much better and mightily relieved you care enough to discuss things. </p>\n<p>\n* Check with your GP whether TDS or some other medical issue might be responsible for lack of sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep the affection and cuddles going between you. </p>\n<p>\n* Definitely have loads of fun sex-play - it doesn't have to go all the way. </p>\n<p>\n* For more TDS info visit <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.sortEDin10.co.uk\">www.sortEDin10.co.uk</a> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nWhether he's in the mood - or experiencing low sex drive  nothing's stopping you two from fun foreplay. Create a seductive \"love zone\" in your sitting room - keep one corner stuffed with cushions, candles at the ready, and your fave music in the player. </p>\n<p>\nKeep a crafty bottle of massage oil handy and give each other the Erotic 8 technique. </p>\n<p>\nTake turns lying on your backs and doing this - it gives sensual stimulation of many erogenous zones. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStart with your hands together at the breastbone and swirl outwards and under their breasts or side of his ribcage. Then bring your hands together at the point just above their navel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen swirl back outwards along their hips bringing your hands back together at their pubic bone. You can see how this makes a figure 8 shape. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRepeat swirling your hands back up their body coming in just above their navel, then outwards and back up to the top of their breastbone. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRepeat varying the pressure and speed of swirling in-and-out over their body.

And, yes, some people might have fantasies about estate agents! </p>\n<p>\nInstead think of location as easy way to keep sex exciting. We're SO influenced by surroundings - no surprise the bedroom gets a bit ho-hum and boring. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Getting creative with locations -</b> </p>\n<p>\nAs long as you're not breaking any laws - or are very careful not to get caught - here are location suggestions. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 1:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* In the bath/shower with warm cascades of water rushing over you. </p>\n<p>\n* On the floor - any floor - but either one that's carpeted or put down a soft blanket. </p>\n<p>\n* Get carried away in the kitchen but you'll definitely need something to cushion kitchen floor tiles/countertops. </p>\n<p>\n* Working hard at your desk and want a break? Maybe you're in a hot new relationship - lean against your desk or workstation for a quickie. </p>\n<p>\n* Just in from an evening out? Why not have a quickie against the doorframe in your front hall. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 2:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* Everyone's gone home so you have the offices to yourselves. Make sure you don't get caught out by the late-night cleaner. </p>\n<p>\n* Get sex-perimental in a swimming pool - the buoyancy of the water makes things fun. Why not let the water lap around you as you go for it on a swimming pool lilo. </p>\n<p>\n* You're at a boring party - nip into the bathroom for a quickie without others knowing. </p>\n<p>\n* Gazing at the stars from a deck chair at your holiday hotel? Then try alfresco sex under the stars. Mind no one can see what you're doing - unless of course you're dogging - in which case that's a different story. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 3: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n* Time for some nail-biting adventure and get sneaky in your office during office hours. A good place is in the stationery cupboard, staff bathroom or behind your locked office door if you have the nerves for it. </p>\n<p>\n* Let's see if you can be so quiet while having sex in your garden shed while your neighbour's sitting next door in their garden haven't a clue. </p>\n<p>\n* Go for some sporting moments and do a 'Boris Becker' in the broom cupboard of a restaurant. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy warning: </b>Dubai is a popular holiday destination but never ever break indecency laws in a country like that. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.16:</b> Students should remember variety is the spice of life - that includes location. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Always have something to hand you can throw over yourselves to cover-up if someone comes by. </p>\n<p>\n* Always have a picnic blanket or at least a thick jacket to put under them for their comfort. Or to pad out any tender body part pressing against, e.g., a stone wall/tree-trunk. Naughty you if you haven't thought of your partner's comfort! </p>\n<p>\n* Pleasure each other with your hands or through oral sex when outdoors. It heightens your sense of risk. </p>\n<p>\n* Simply start your foreplay when out and about - save finishing each other off at home can lead to exhilarating sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Once spring is here use sun cream for any under-exposed body area that may see the light of day  like your bum! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\n'Take 10' to think about your local area and dream up a new location to suggest. When cuddling up tell describe how that beauty spot you go for walks in would be the perfect place to grab some sneaky sex - or at least some fun foreplay. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The equation:</b> Always having sex in bed = using the same position time-after-time.

But if either goes queasy at the thought, there's plenty to discuss before slipping into a sex club armed with little more than a nervous grin and condoms. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule:</b> Must I tell you no one should be pressured into a three- or moresome if they're not into it? Exactly! Discussion is one thing, pressure is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nCouples who discuss fantasies to spice-up sex usually delve into the arena of three-ways. </p>\n<p>\nBut fantasies are SO different to reality. It's hard enough grappling with two sets of sexual needs plus the more embarrassing side of sex like sweaty bodies and surprising sounds. </p>\n<p>\nFactor in a third set of these things and suddenly keeping it only to fantasy-chat is appealing. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise if determined to go for it: </p>\n<p>\n* You both must really, really want to try it. </p>\n<p>\n* Agree how to go about it, e.g., do you want to look through contact mags or go to a local swinging party or fetish club to find a third-party. </p>\n<p>\n* Sex clubs all have their own rules so check these out. </p>\n<p>\n* Agreeing ground rules is a must. Some couples put certain sexual behaviour off limits like giving or receiving oral sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Accept either - or both - might experience jealousy if feeling threatened in any way by the third party. That includes thinking the third party is more attractive, better in bed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Excellent communication between you is crucial to avoid jealousy/insecurity. </p>\n<p>\n* Discuss whether you'll have the same third party involved in regular sex sessions or always look for new partners. Some couples prefer seeing the same third party. Others worry some sort of love triangle might form threatening their relationship. </p>\n<p>\n* Be prepared that after trying this one of you might go off the idea. </p>\n<p>\n* Get all MI6 about it and \"debrief\" after each experience to see how you're both feeling. </p>\n<p>\n* Crucial to abide by ground rules like NO outside contact - like phone calls - with any new sex partners. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nSpend time discussing each other's motives for wanting a threesome. Some are positive - you're both sexually confident and experimental. Others negative - you need a confidence boost or to combat bedroom boredom. </p>\n<p>\nNegative things need serious consideration because adding a third person is likely to complicate these. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nBefore going for it, get in bed and try to fully imagine having a third person in there with you. Spelling out the details to each other might make you more cautious. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Desire to try it + complete confidence between you = worth a shot! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How much cool cash did Michelle Obama reportedly spend this week in Agent Provocateur's New York emporium? </p>\n<p>\nA) &#163;320 </p>\n<p>\nB) &#163;32,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) &#163;3,200 </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge Answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - that's a heckuva lot of oh-oh-heaven for President Obama. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Heidi Klum and Seal</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nYep, this super-gorgeous couple are separated but Seal said in an interview this week he still loves Heidi. </p>\n<p>\nWhere there's love, there's a way to sort things out.

So if he or she is always pestering you for sex - and you just don't have the interest - you've got a lot of company. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not really surprising - after all when you got together he preferred pizza and she preferred Chinese. He loved an action holiday and she loved lying on the beach. So why wouldn't your sex drives be different too? </p>\n<p>\nBut there's double-trouble when this happens. The partner who has a higher drive feels neglected. And the partner who has a lower drive feels pestered or inadequate. </p>\n<p>\nThese issues have a way of creeping into the rest of your relationship even when you know you love your partner. Time to tackle the differences between your drives. </p>\n<p>\nThe first step is to stop any finger-pointing. Playing the blame game will get you nowhere. Being honest, loving and tactful is the only way to go. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.14: Students should remember there is no right or wrong to how high or low your sex drive is as long as you're both working towards a compromise.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\nHere are some [not all, mind you] of the main culprits affecting sex drive - see how many might apply to you or your partner. </p>\n<p>\n* lifestyle issues like out-of-control stress and long working hours </p>\n<p>\n* personal choices like excessive drinking, and 'recreational' drug use </p>\n<p>\n* being overweight leading to less sexual energy </p>\n<p>\n* experiencing depression and anxiety </p>\n<p>\n* relationship difficulties or breakdown, rows, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* certain physical problems like having a bad back are draining </p>\n<p>\n* fatigue after childbirth can kill sexual desire </p>\n<p>\n* surprising things affect sex drive including medications like the birth control pill, anti-depressants and blood pressure medications </p>\n<p>\n* hormonal changes later in life for both men and women </p>\n<p>\n* other passion killers include worries over financial problems </p>\n<p>\n* and to be brutally honest... plain old boredom in the bedroom can lead to lack of sex drive </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\nPut aside 10 minutes this weekend to study this list and work out if these - or any other things - are affecting your sex drive or your partner's. </p>\n<p>\nIf you identify a culprit or two what can you do about these? The first step is to share this info with your partner - a positive \"we can fix this together\" attitude has been proven to help. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're overly stressed at work  it's killed your sex drive leaving your partner high and dry. Obviously deal with the stresses - take on fewer responsibilities, talk to your manager about streamlining your work load, etc. </p>\n<p>\nBut when you feel up to a fun solution play a sex-game where you pretend to be someone completely different - someone without a care in the world. </p>\n<p>\nGive yourself 'permission' to let go and have fun. Tell your partner you're shutting out worries and focusing on some sexy pleasure. Spin this into a hot fantasy where you're the boss in your dream job - and you're interviewing them to work for you. The main interview 'test'?

Try my tips, tricks and techniques to sexy satisfaction: </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 1: How To Find Out What They Desire</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMany are too shy to say what they like. If your partner's shy take their finger and gently suck and kiss it - then ask if those sensations feel good. Put that info to good use for kissing and sucking their different erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nAlso say something like, \"Do you prefer it when I stroke or squeeze you here?\" It gives them the confidence to be honest. </p>\n<p>\nDefo tell them it's exciting when they tell you what to do to them. Make it playful where they must \"command\" you by saying Yes or No if you're touching the right spot - and in the right way. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 2: Any Activity Can Be Sexy</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTurn practically any activity together into sexy fun and give each other little sensual pleasures. Offer to wash their hair - gently and sensually caress their scalp as the warm water rushes over it...heaven! </p>\n<p>\nOr do something surprising like paint her fingernails. Take each of her fingers gently and show just how sensual your touch can be as you paint each nail. </p>\n<p>\nNever miss a trick when sharing supper to get a little bit rude with food. It's incredibly hot to hand feed each other. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 3: Quickie Tricks</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDevise your favourite 'quickie tricks' that press both of your buttons. For instance he might have one perfect way of touching her that turns her right on. She should let him know what it is because that's the technique to use when you've only got a little time. </p>\n<p>\nWhy doesn't he try 'twirling the pearl' for a quick turn-on? Using his thumb and index finger he gently twirls back and forth around her clitoral region. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 4: Have a laugh</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nToo many couples take sex too seriously - they forget to laugh with (not at!) each other even when things go wrong. </p>\n<p>\nTry fun things like spontaneously deciding to jump into a shower together. Enjoy the water rushing over you, lather each other up, and even invest in a waterproof sex toy. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got ice cubes in a drink have a giggle and slip one down each other's tops - then roll around in bed trying to get it off your skin - and back onto theirs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 5: Kinky-lite</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTry 'Kinky-lite' techniques like playing a little game of At Your Mercy - one of you is blindfolded while the other is allowed to touch, kiss, and lick all over. You don't know which area's going to be touched next! </p>\n<p>\nOr agree to have your wrists tied together with something soft and silky like a dressing gown sash - have some fantasy chat about being at your partner's mercy. Take turns being tied up! </p>\n<p>\nBe up for a little romp outdoors when you have the opportunity - it can be super-hot knowing you might get caught or seen. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.13: Students should ALWAYS be prepared! </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nStock<b> </b>up a \"pleasure chest\" next to the bed.

Or they get stuck just moving a vibrator back and forth - a bit snooze-inducing. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sex Toy Etiquette:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nNever introduce a sex toy by whipping a big, shiny, pulsating one out, waving it around and expecting your partner to be instantly aroused. Instead try these ploys \n</p>\n<p>\n*If unsure of their reaction be subtle - suggest popping into your local adult shop and gently steer them to the vibrators. </p>\n<p>\n*Start toying with said toys and look quizzical - as if you're wondering whether they'd be fun or not. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask if they've ever thought about what playing with a vibrator would be like. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep it light and flirty to give them confidence to take a good look at the toys. </p>\n<p>\n*Never grab the biggest vibrator (and crikey there are some huge ones on the market) particularly if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep sex toys as an added extra to your sex-play so your partner doesn't feel redundant. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Good Vibrations:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAlways use lashings of lubricant for a lovely smooth glide across any erogenous zone. </p>\n<p>\nRemember he might be just as keen as she is to feel a vibrator running up and down his chest, abdomen, between the thighs, over the perineum and anal area. </p>\n<p>\nProblem is many men don't want to appear anything but 'straight' - so she should suggest it. </p>\n<p>\nOr after he's used a vibrator on her erogenous zones she can tease him with it. Sometimes it takes her confidence that it's okay for him to enjoy vibrating pleasure for him to relax and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>\nFor added pleasure during penetrative sex slip the vibrator between you two. They come in all sorts of shapes/sizes so invest in a range for different uses - a slimmer one will slip between the two of you easier. </p>\n<p>\nJust in case it's got a powerful vibration, first run it across their abdomen so they can get used to the feel of it. Then you can ask if she's ready for it to be run across her breasts or he's ready to have it run between his thighs. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she's turned on, gently run it back and forth across her pubic mound. Rather than using the end of the vibrator to touch her skin, lay it 'flat' along her pubic bone and move it back and forth covering a bigger area with the vibrations. Guaranteed to drive her crazy! </p>\n<p>\nIt's definitely worth investing in a fingertip vibrator. Slip onto your forefinger and reach all sorts of tiny and exciting places that a normal-sized vibrator can't. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.12:</b> Students shouldn't use a vibrator for more than 20 minutes on one area as you can over-stimulate that area. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Hygiene is crucial so, e.g., if you use an anal vibrator it shouldn't then be used on her vagina. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep separate sex toys for each other. </p>\n<p>\n* Clean your sex toys as per the instructions. </p>\n<p>\n* Before you use a new sex toy get used to the way it works - some are complicated. </p>\n<p>\n* Never ever use everyday items as makeshift sex toys! </p>\n<p>\n* As well as pleasuring each other use for self-pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n* When using lubricants choose water-based ones that won't break down the surface of your plastic-based toys. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you've never tried a 'tongue joy' vibrator get one for oral pleasure! </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nThis neat little vibrator slips onto your tongue so that during oral sex not only does your partner feel the warmth and moistness of your lips and tongue but also the fabulous little vibrations from this sex toy. So practice putting it on your tongue when you're alone and imagine gently flicking it around their most sensitive areas. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: a little vibrator + tongue-action = super hot climaxes! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: With so much talk about 'cougars'(older women) - what about older men?

Make this your sexiest Blissmas ever with my 12 simple steps: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 1:</b> Being time-short is the biggest problem so book one or two red hot dates in your diaries between now and Christmas. Don't let anything come between you and these dates. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 2:</b> Time to tempt each other - so turn up the flirt factor. All your messaging should be loving and sexy. </p>\n<p>\nAnd when you've got each other on Skype or the phone 'talk up' your forthcoming dates. Delve into delicious detail about what you're planning. </p>\n<p>\nThose sexologist boffins show that your phone voice can be a massive turn on - slightly lower it and speak a bit slower. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 3:</b> Both men and women like being told what turns their partner on. So send each other a sexy seasonal card describing five things you'd like to do when together. You can have fun deciding which techniques to try. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 4:</b> Sort out your sexy gear. Plan an outfit you feel confident in - confidence is sexy. </p>\n<p>\nIf you've got new sky-high heels break them in so they're comfortable on the big night. He might want you to keep them on in bed! </p>\n<p>\nWhat's underneath counts even more - he'll love the fact stockings and suspenders have made a comeback. And the guys should definitely sort out some sexy pants to turn her on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 5:</b> Do a daring deed! Why not tease and touch each other under the table at a bar or restaurant. No one will guess why you two have such big smiles. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 6:</b> Turn your desire up a notch by agreeing you can't have full sex for a few days. When together enjoy some hot foreplay, touching and massage - but nothing further. </p>\n<p>\nGive each other a Thai Body Massage - strip off to the waist and with lashings of massage oil glide your bodies back and forth across each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 7:</b> Do some sizzling seasonal shopping - there are many fantastic toys at high street sex shops. </p>\n<p>\nInvesting in one fun and sexy toy will give hours of sex-tra pleasure. He may never have tried one but men love 'good vibrations' up and down, and in-between their thighs. </p>\n<p>\nGet to know how it works before sharing the sexy vibes with each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 8:</b> Dream up a festive fantasy to share. Get cosy and enjoy fantasy chat where you take turns saying what happens next in the fantasy scenario. </p>\n<p>\nFor instance, describe a fantasy where you're the boss and they're the assistant and you're the last two at the Christmas office party. You slip into the board room, lock the door and have your evil way with each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 9:</b> Get cracking and plan a new technique to try on them. Maybe you're a sensational snogger - why not think of some luscious lip-action for all over their body. </p>\n<p>\nTry the 'swirl and poke' kissing technique - alternate swirling your tongue around one of their erogenous zones with gently poking with it. Feels fabulous! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 10:</b> Buy some seasonal treats and prepare a candlelit picnic - maybe in the bedroom! </p>\n<p>\nGet their favourite finger foods as well as mini mince pies and chocolate Santas. Savour little mouthfuls before turning each other into a Christmas feast. </p>\n<p>\nTrickle some fizz down her cleavage for him to lick off. And sprinkle morsels of mince pies across his chest for her to nibble. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 11:</b> Get steamed up in a sensual shower to super-tease each other. You might have been out dancing at a Christmas 'do' and can get fresh and clean together. </p>\n<p>\nHave big, warm, fluffy towels ready to wrap each other up in. Enjoy some gorgeous, loving cuddles together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 12:</b> You've come to the end of your 12 days of Blissmas and tonight is 'the night'. Send flirty messages during the day then slip into those sexy new things for a steamy seasonal night together. </p>\n<p>\nDefinitely try the new position below. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule:</b> If you've managed to get frazzled in the run-up to the festivities then talk to each other about it. Honesty and lots of hugs will see you through. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many women have tried a sex toy? </p>\n<p>\nA) 44 per cent </p>\n<p>\nB) 14 per cent </p>\n<p>\nC) 84 per cent </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - research suggests 44 per cent of women have enjoyed sex toy pleasure. </p>\n<h2>\nLoved-up Celebs: Caroline Flack and Harry Styles </h2>\n<p>\nUsually I live up to my nickname of the 'Love Doctor' and champion romance even in the quirkiest couples - but not in this case. Yep, it's a legal relationship but that doesn't mean it is right. </p>\n<p>\nNeurologist boffins [they study the brain] have found that between the ages of 14 and 17 brains are rapidly changing leading too chaotic and confused feelings. It's hard enough for a 17-year-old to have a relationship with someone of the same age - let alone someone 15 years older. Add to this the intense national scrutiny and I can only see it ending in tears. </p>\n<p>\nThere's nothing wrong with an age gap relationship on the whole - but they work far better if both people have at least reached their 20s. Otherwise there's a risk the older partner takes over and controls everything. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Sexy Santa [normally called The Staging Post] </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI specially renamed this red hot position The Sexy Santa for Christmas.

So a man might say he has a 'fetish' for large breasts but lo-and-behold his partner has small ones. And a woman might say she has a 'fetish' for men in gym gear but she doesn't turn into a raving nympho the minute a man strolls into her aerobics class. </p>\n<p>\nWhere do fetishes come from? Sometimes the development of a fetish is very complex but other fetishes are easily understood. Take the teenage boy pleasuring himself as he stands at his bedroom window. He catches sight of the neighbour doing some gardening in her Wellington boots and hey, presto, Wellington boots forever hold a special meaning. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a fetish checklist every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Always ask your partner to describe exactly what they mean by 'fetish'. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Check out if they can only be turned on with their fetish or if it's simply a preference. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Have fun considering compromises. For instance, if he has a fetish for women in PVC it might work for her to slip into a PVC basque OR miniskirt. She doesn't have to dress head-to-toe in it yet he'll love the fact she's wearing one PVC piece. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>See if fantasy chat about the fetish will satisfy that partner's desire. You could potentially chat up a storm about him worshiping your feet - instead of him actually licking and sucking your toes if that turns you right off [think Fergie all those years ago]. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Some fetishes might seem downright comical - like a fetish for pink, fluffy slippers or footie strips. But resist having a laugh at your partner if they're willing to trust you and open up. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>If either of you are troubled by their fetish consider sex therapy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule: Be honest if a fetish turns you off.</b> If a fetish like splodging [having a 'good' time hurling cream cakes, etc., or rolling around in puds] makes you laugh it can spoil the moment for the partner that takes their splodging seriously. </p>\n<p>\nDitto if your partner has what you think is a disgusting fetish involving something like 'scat play' [let's not even go there!] put your foot down fast. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> Think through how you can enjoy your partner's fetish. Let's say they've a fetish for gloves. Buy a pair and surprise them during foreplay by whisking them on. </p>\n<p>\nFor their added pleasure select the texture your partner prefers - soft and velvety, smooth and silky, firm and leathery. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy sex trick:</b> as you'll be left- or right-handed - and probably use that hand in foreplay - try swapping over. Use the hand you don't normally use to caress them giving a new sensation. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A fun attitude + fun fetishes = fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of people have a foot fetish according to fetish research - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 1.1% </p>\n<p>\nB) 11% </p>\n<p>\nC) 21% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - just over 1% of people reportedly have a foot fetish. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Jennifer Lopez and Casper Smart </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nJ-Lo, 42, has revealed her credentials as a top-class cougar by getting with tattooed toyboy dancer Casper Smart, 24. The chemistry between them sizzles and right now they seem inseparable. </p>\n<p>\nBut I hope Jennifer's as savvy as Madonna when it comes to cougar love. Madonna plays by a simple rule: these are fun, sexy relationships that both parties can enjoy... but they're not permanent! </p>\n<p>\nDemi Moore on the other hand has found out the tough way most younger men don't stick around for a happy-ever-after. There's far too much temptation out there and most aren't in the mental place yet for a committed, lifelong relationship. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Lovers' Embrace</b> </p>\n<p>\nTry moving into this sensual position from classic Missionary (where he's on top). </p>\n<p>\nAll he needs to do is gently slide off of her while gently pulling her towards him - so they end up on their sides facing each other. Once in position she simply lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p>\nTo vary the sexy sensations she can move her leg further up his hip - or close it down more tightly around his knees. By wrapping her leg around his knees and pulling his legs more into hers it adds lots of good friction between them - great if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\nSextra Academy tip: Allow your hands to wander over each other's backs and bums. You can cradle each other's bottoms so that the pressure of your movements don't push you two apart. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steamy-Sex-Doctors-Answers-Keeping/dp/1907532242/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288191214&amp;sr=1-5\">HERE</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>For more advice visit <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.drpam.co.uk\">www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons: Friends with Benefits </h1>\n<p>\nWe told you this week of a new survey suggesting pals are providing more than a 'friendly shoulder' to their best mates. Evidently a whopping 33% of single girls sleep with their male friends. </p>\n<p>\nSuch friendship fringe benefits put a smile on many faces. But handled badly friends can fall-out over their best mate booty-calls. </p>\n<p>\nHere are definite 'dos and don'ts' for your friendship that strays into full-sex territory: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Friends often flirt with each other - which is why many question whether men and women can really 'just be friends'. So take it cautiously if there's been flirting between you and secretly you'd like things to end up in bed. They may not feel the same! </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> It's likely the first time you two slept together it was under the influence of too many drinks...the classic starting point for so many friends with fringe benefits. So have a chat the morning after to make sure you're both feeling okay about it. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Never humiliate your friend by telling your other pals what you two got up to. Keeping it between your selves avoids loads of gossip or other friends sticking their oar in. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Even if you two have occasionally gone all-the-way no friend should feel pressured to always say Yes to a booty call. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Don't be surprised when your friendly fringe benefits end because one of you finds a proper boyfriend or girlfriend. No room for jealousy - after all you were only friends that took it further. </p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No.9: Always be honest with a friend you're sleeping with. If you know they're falling in love with you - and you don't feel the same - set them straight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSince you've already got trust between you why not get up to some hot sex-perimentation you wouldn't normally try? Go on, they're a friend so don't be slow in coming forward. Ask if there's something they've always wanted to do. </p>\n<p>\nThis is the perfect time to share something like a steamy shower where you sensually lather each other up. Then you can take turns satisfying each other with oral pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Tip:</b> Take a cushion into the shower to kneel on when you're giving oral sex (mind you, a cushion you don't mind getting soaked). </p>\n<p>\nAs the water cascades down you'll both love the sensations of having oral fun under a shower. Have two big warm towels ready to dry each other off with. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nNow you know loads more about each other's likes and dislikes having got playful in the shower. Take that knowledge into the bedroom for more sex-ploration. Why not ask them to keep still while you gently run a sex toy up and down their body to give them lovely sensations. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: friends + fringe benefits = having fun (if you both know where you stand)! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Test Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people who have flings-with-friends are hoping for a relationship too? </p>\n<p>\nA) 8% </p>\n<p>\nB) 38% </p>\n<p>\nC) 68% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - 8% of people who sleep with a friend say they're also hoping for romance. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Loved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Sarah Harding and Tom Crane </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nStunning Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding looks like she's sorting out her personal problems as well as her broken engagement with DJ Tom Crane.

They care more about a guy's personality - plus his sex-techniques that'll satisfy every time. </p>\n<p>\nBut try telling that to a 'smaller' man - it takes loads of encouragement for them to believe it. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The Size Statistics:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrossing the Channel there are 'size stats' from French research out this week. The beret-clad boffins found the average erect penis is between 12.8 - 14.5 cm [5 - 5.7 inches]. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's smaller than this it doesn't mean he can't 'live it large' in the bedroom with many top tips below. </p>\n<p>\nFirst a quick question: Are you a \"grower\" or \"shower\"? Many smaller men when flaccid [non-erect] actually grow 100 per cent when erect. Many larger men when flaccid are likely to grow by only 75 per cent when erect. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.8:</b> No Academy student should ever ridicule a man's size - such remarks can scar him for life. If a woman ridicules your size she's not worth your time. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* The Americans have a saying \"a diamond's better than a brick\" - so a 'smaller' man should always be confident about giving pleasure in other ways. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Remember that some [not all] well-endowed men have no sexual finesse in bed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* It's crucial a man sees himself as a complete man - not just a man with a certain-sized penis. He's far more than his penis size! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Confidence is highly attractive. So the smaller man that's confident generally - and about his sex techniques - will satisfy his partner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* The average length of a woman's vagina when aroused is about 10 cm [4 inches]. So it doesn't take as much length to satisfy her as men think. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* So-called Small Penis Syndrome - or 'locker room syndrome' - is more common in men of average size. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Despite the 'averages' there's huge variation amongst men. The famous Masters and Johnson's research team measured hundreds of penises - the longest non-erect one was 5.5 inches long. The shortest was just over 2 inches long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* A 'smaller' man should aim to be the \"King of foreplay\" to thrill his partner. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework [and this applies to any couple not just a man on the smaller side!]: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBecome the King of Foreplay by confidently asking her what she'd like you to do. As you kiss ask what kind of touch she'd like on her breasts, etc. </p>\n<p>\nLearn to use your fingertips wisely  vary between gentle strokes, circular movements, swishing back and forth, and gentle pinches. Keep asking what feels best. </p>\n<p>\nDitto your tongue and lips - try licking, flicking, sucking and circular movements with your tongue. </p>\n<p>\nCompletely spoil her by kissing, licking and touching all over her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe can encourage him to become the King of foreplay: if you feel shy asking for what you want when cuddling take his hands and move them to your fave erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nKeeping your hand on top of his, gently move it back and forth over these showing the type of touch you like. </p>\n<p>\nTake his finger between your lips and suck it the way you'd like him to apply pressure to your fave zones like your nipples. </p>\n<p>\nYou'll really turn him on if you get the courage up to whisper detailed instructions of what feels best as you get nearer to climax. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Foreplay techniques + confidence = a great lover! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of women report being happy/satisfied with their partner's penis size - </p>\n<p>\nA) 5% </p>\n<p>\nB) 85% </p>\n<p>\nC) 25% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 85 per cent of women are perfectly satisfied by their partner's size. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>George Clooney and Stacy Keibler </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe big question on Tinseltown's lips is whether gorgeous George Clooney has met his match in stunning wrestler Stacy Keibler. </p>\n<p>\nThe statuesque blonde would be wise to treat it like a wrestling match - going in with a game plan if she wants to beat his reputed phobia of commitment. </p>\n<p>\nIf you're with a man that's shy of committing let your confident independent side shine through. Men like that are far more attracted to confidence then clingy-ness. And we should all be at our confident best for healthy relationships anyway. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Cradled CAT</b> </p>\n<p>\nPreviously I've described the CAT [coital alignment technique] and for 'smaller' men this variation is perfect.

This sends the \"Yawn Factor\" in the bedroom sky high. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhy do couples do this? Like most things in their relationship their sex position simply becomes a habit. For instance, it's Friday night and he's on his way home - he thinks to himself, \"Ah, it's sex night, that means a couple brews and Spoons position before bedtime.\" Mind you, she's probably thinking the same. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNothing wrong with 'comfortable' sex in a long-term relationship - but without occasional changes it's a passion killer. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Inwardly many partners feel shy about suggesting a new position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Or they don't want to upset their partner by suggesting a new one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Couples don't realise it's fairly easy to move into another position from their tried-and-tested one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*If they don't like a new position they can go back to the old one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*It's okay to take time after being in one position to pause for more foreplay - it might lead into trying a second position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No. 7: You don't have to stay in one position from the start of a sex-session to the finish. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nYour Hot Homework: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Try one of the following suggestions:</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n1/ Let's begin with a simple sex-periment - begin in classic Missionary position  he lies on top of her. Then he shifts his weight off of her, moving onto his side and facing her. This frees her to move onto her side but with her back to him. As easy as that you're now in Spoons position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n2/ Try The Cradle position  she's on top, lying chest-against-chest with him. She draws her legs up underneath her so her knees are bent. It's called the Cradle because it's as if she's now cradling him with her body. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis is perfect for slow and sensual moving and allows you two lots of touching and kissing. Some women may need to reach under and cradle his bottom to steady them if his thrusting intensifies. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n3/ Or experiment with the Lovers' Embrace position. You can easily move into this from The Cradle [above] - you both gently ease sideways. Or from Spoons - she simply turns around to face him. Or move into it from Missionary. All you do is lie on your sides facing each other, embracing. She lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy spice-it-up tip: To vary sensations she moves her leg further up or closes it back down more tightly on his leg. This varies the pressure you both feel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFirst reassure your partner you enjoy what you do together - but that you want to tempt them into </p>\n<p>\none of these new positions. Be confident that it's going to be fun. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A positive attitude + A new position = Fun sex! </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nQ: In one survey how many women said they could find their elusive G-spot - was it: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA/ 56% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nB/ 16% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nC/ 6% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer: </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A/ - 56% said they have a sensitive area on the front wall of the vagina </p>\n<p>\npopularly known as the G-spot.

Most people have a few quirks or kinks they secretly wonder about. Often these aren't mentioned until they build trust with their partner. Obviously they don't want to be laughed at or to shock their partner. </p>\n<p>\nAs far as I'm concerned - as long it is legal - what you as consenting adults discuss trying is your business. </p>\n<p>\nThe most common kinky things partners ask to try include: Being blindfolded, a bit of spanking, tying up, and dressing in role-play outfits. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 6</b>: Students should never feel pressured to go beyond the 'kink-level' they feel happy with! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\nIf your partner raises kinky sex-play (or you want to raise it with them) try these: </p>\n<p>\n*Be clear exactly what's meant. The word \"bondage\" might be mentioned and all they mean is getting fur-lined handcuffs from the high street adult shop. They don't mean sticking you in a dungeon! </p>\n<p>\n*Because some partners will panic at words like \"bondage\" think carefully how you describe the thing you want to try... so take the fright-factor out. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll boost your confidence if you stick to some fantasy-chat first. It's fun and sexy and you can sound out how far you two might want to go. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll make you both feel secure reassuring each other this is \"special occasion sex\". You're not going to have to 'swing from chandeliers' every time you have sex. </p>\n<p>\n*If you do anything like handcuffing each other remember it's no joke to leave someone handcuffed (or tied up). Just don't do it! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's take the handcuffs scenario - invest in some from an adult shop. Or spare your blushes and order them online. Then experiment on each other. </p>\n<p>\nYou can tease the person who's handcuffed by kissing them all over and even \"tormenting\" them with an ice cube held between your lips. Trace a cold line over their erogenous zones only to be warmed up with a trail of lovely warm kisses afterwards. </p>\n<p>\nOr while they're \"captive\" turn it into a hot fantasy where you're taking them away to be kept as your sexy prisoner. Have fun with banter along these lines - or any other scenario that you two conjure up. </p>\n<p>\nHeighten the teasing by using their favourite sex toy on them while they're handcuffed. It's so going to be payback time when it's your turn to be cuffed. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: handcuffs + sensitive handling = fun experimentation! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of people admit to getting turned on by spanking - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 75% </p>\n<p>\nB) 15% </p>\n<p>\nC) 5% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 15% of people enjoy a bit of a spank - either giving or receiving! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Alex Turner + mystery brunette </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's only been a couple months since Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner split with long-term love Alexa Chung.

It's only the next girlfriend that finds out... when he acts a bit crazy, can't commit, breaks her heart, etc. </p>\n<p>\nWomen tend to know they're packing an extra suitcase of emotional stuff and hopefully deal with it.

But people still lack confidence about getting dressed up in sexy gear - particularly some of the fetish gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's understandable, no one wants to look foolish, but you shouldn't underestimate the visual impact of wearing sexy things. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips for sizzling in sexy gear: </p>\n<p>\n* When you're with someone new don't slip into something super-kinky - they might feel a bit intimidated. </p>\n<p>\n* Add in sexy gear one step at a time. </p>\n<p>\n* Suggest shopping together to get the balance right - choose anything from sexy-lite to full-on-fetish. </p>\n<p>\n* If you're going to surprise your partner with a hot new outfit think about the things they mention in their fantasies. Do they talk about thigh-high, black patent lace-up boots or little floral dresses? Let those things guide your choices. </p>\n<p>\n* Beware of overdoing it. Sexy stilettos and a short skirt might look amazing. But if you also wear a lace-up basque it might be OTT - you can have too much of a good thing! </p>\n<p>\n* You can get lots of cheap n' cheerful gear or one 'investment' piece, e.g., a gorgeous hand-made basque. Is your partner going to want to have fun ripping it off - like in a bodice-ripping fantasy? Maybe go for the cheap n' cheerful stuff! </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought something sexy to wear - practice flaunting yourself in it on your own. That helps banish feelings that you look silly. Gradually you'll think, Hmmm, I look pretty hot! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 5:</b> Students should never embarrass a partner who's attempted to dress-up for them. You could 'scar' them permanently by telling them they look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Nearly 10% of people say it'd turn them on if their partner dressed up in a uniform. Playing 'doctors and nurses' has never been so much fun now you can pick up these outfits from adult shops. </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought an outfit have some fun with a little bit of role-play. </p>\n<p>\n* If you both enjoy sexy dressing-up occasionally go to costume hire shops for some adventurous ideas. </p>\n<p>\n* There is loads of fun gear for men - he might end up strutting around the bedroom in a black leather, studded man's thong. </p>\n<p>\n* If, as a woman, you're not happy about your legs stilettos and high-heeled boots lengthen them - and make you feel super sexy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe next time you two are 'in the mood' let your partner know you'd like to try a bit of dressing up. Start gently saying something like \"I've fantasised about you wearing old-fashioned stockings and suspenders.\" </p>\n<p>\nThis doesn't feel threatening to them and can plant the beginning of some great ideas. Have fun with it and ask her/him what they think of this - and if they've ever wanted to wear kinky gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet creative with things you already have that could work well as sexy gear. Pair some very high heels with little frilly knickers - strut around in front of him with you both pretending he's caught you out getting dressed. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: imagination + sexy gear = red hot love! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percent of people say they get turned on by spanking - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA/ 15% </p>\n<p>\nB/ 75% </p>\n<p>\nC/ 5% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A/ - 15% of people say they like to include spanking in their sex play.

But those who keep talking and supporting each other - as Amanda and Chris obviously did - can come out the other side fighting and with a stronger relationship. </p>\n<p>\nIf you two are facing a crisis, face it together and support each other. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Courtesan</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a sophisticated position that she can pair-up with some new sexy gear she's bought - like a short miniskirt minus her knickers. </p>\n<p>\nShe sits on a lowish chair or at the end of the bed. He kneels in front of her - on the floor - facing her. Their hips need to be at the same height for full sex. </p>\n<p>\nAs they kiss and cuddle she lifts her legs carefully and wraps them around his lower back. She pulls him in towards her and edges on to the end of the bed or chair. </p>\n<p>\nHe studies her by holding her around her waist. Once they're in position and comfortable he can begin gentle thrusting. </p>\n<p>\nThey may not last long in this position - as she needs quite a bit of strength to keep her legs wrapped around him - but it's an excellent one for them to continue kissing and caressing. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steamy-Sex-Doctors-Answers-Keeping/dp/1907532242/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288191214&amp;sr=1-5\">HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.drpam.co.uk\">www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons Week 4: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Body-image issues that stop you enjoying sex</b> </p>\n<p>\nIn extensive body-image research I found staggering numbers of women insist on lights-off during sex with their fella - over 40 per cent.

Sadly women think men will heads for the hills at the glimpse of a bulge. </p>\n<p>\nBut it doesn't stop there as now the fellas have body-image issues too. So the Academy aims to banish body hang-ups  men's and women's - from the bedroom. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips to boost body confidence - </p>\n<p>\n* Daily remind yourself you're more than what your body looks like - focus on your top personality traits - e.g. you're funny, kind, caring, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Take charge of negative thoughts about your body. Tell yourself nobody's perfect, no one cares about lumps and bumps, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Face reality: do you want to waste time wishing you had a smaller bum or bigger breasts OR get smart and put your energies into enjoying life - including your sex life? </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Choose your sexiest attribute - maybe your naughty smile or cheeky glint in your eye etc. Value these special lovely little things - and flash that smile. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Buy things that accentuate your good attributes. Be proud to flaunt those - whether it's your breasts, bottom, legs, shoulders etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* If you genuinely have excess weight do something FUN to get fit, e.g., take some sensual Latin American dance classes. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 4:</b> Each day students should close their eyes for a few moments and visualise themselves as a Sex Goddess or Sex God. Hang onto this hot and sexy image for the rest of the day! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Most people simply don't notice what you think are your bad points. </p>\n<p>\n* Research shows sexiness comes from confidence - walk tall, with good posture, pretending to be confident - you'll soon believe it. </p>\n<p>\n* You're not the only one with body issues - that person in bed with you probably feels the same inside. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDevise your own super-hot 'signature sex technique' - take a sexy thing you already do well and make it even hotter. This helps you lose inhibitions - and worries about your body - since you'll feel confident doing your signature technique. </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're fab at kissing and also pretty good at giving oral sex. Why not devise your very own oral technique that uses your snogging skills? </p>\n<p>\nFor instance if you're great at French kissing apply those techniques 'down below'. You'll have your partner gasping for more - all they'll notice is how great you make them feel. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your technique + extra effort = your signature sex technique! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people feel too embarrassed to talk about sex - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 91% </p>\n<p>\nB) 31% </p>\n<p>\nC) 1% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is B) - a large survey found 31% of people are too embarrassed to talk about sex even with a partner. If you don't talk to each other you won't get what you want! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Loved-up Celebs </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nHollywood hunk Will Smith and wife Jade Pinkett Smith have denied break-up rumours. A couple who always present a united front the splitting-up stories were surprising. </p>\n<p>\nThe strong theme of their love? Definitely the way they keep their family unit tight - forming Team-Smith with children Jaden and Willow. This is the perfect way to handle their stratospheric celebrity status with all its temptations. </p>\n<p>\nCouples should take a page out of their book and protect their love by creating some 'team spirit' between them. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Spoons </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a great position for anyone overcoming body confidence issues because neither of you gets a good look at each other's bodies. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of you lie on your sides, the man behind, the curve of her back and bottom snuggled into the curve of his stomach and chest. She parts her legs for full sex. </p>\n<p>\nBy alternating how high she lifts her top leg it varies the friction they feel. He can carry on with foreplay with his arms wrapped around her - easy to run his hands over her erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nThe Spoons is versatile and ideal for a slow, sensual or more vigorous sex. Plus it also hits the spot - the g-spot. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steamy-Sex-Doctors-Answers-Keeping/dp/1907532242/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288191214&amp;sr=1-5\">HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.www.drpam.co.uk\">www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons: Week 3 </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Great Climax Guide - how to bring her to oh-oh-heaven!</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt any given time somewhere in the region of 70 per cent of women having sex aren't reaching climax. And only about 15 per cent climax regularly. Those statistics equal a whole load of disappointment! But we can change this today. </p>\n<p>\nHere are some pointers every good student should learn - the first section is for the girls (but the guys should take a peak): </p>\n<p>\n* Reject thoughts that you'll \"never climax\" - it's easy to slip into a negative mindset when you've never climaxed with a man. </p>\n<p>\n*Even if you're with a partner where it's never happened, tell yourself \"I'm going to start afresh and be positive - it can happen if I relax about it!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n*Women should know how their body works. The best way forward is letting your fingers do the walking through self-pleasure. Men are masters of this - high time women became the mistresses of their bodies too. </p>\n<p>\n*Self-pleasure arms you with knowledge you then share with a partner. </p>\n<p>\n*Relax in a warm bath, the shower, or in bed with the lights down low. Maybe light a candle, put on some mood music and explore your body. </p>\n<p>\n*Share the sensations you discover with him the next time you're together. </p>\n<p>\nAnd for the guys: </p>\n<p>\n*Sorry guys, you may think you're Mr. Lover-man but what you think works may not work for her! </p>\n<p>\n* Help her relax and tell her to take her time. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask her what you can do to help bring her along. </p>\n<p>\n*She might feel embarrassed because it takes time to climax but reassurance will go a long way. </p>\n<p>\n*Really listen to her suggestions - hopefully she knows what works for her - she just needs to share it. </p>\n<p>\n*Don't get stressed-out if it takes some time getting to know what works for her. Treat it as sex-perimentation! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 3:</b> Students shouldn't fake orgasms - it seems okay when you don't want to \"hurt his feelings\" because you're tired and it's just not going to happen. But in the long run honesty's best. There's nothing wrong with enjoying sex-play knowing you're too tired for it to end in a climax. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet started with lashings of foreplay for her. Take your time showering her with kisses. Definitely kiss around the back of her neck and ears - unless she's supersensitive this is oh-oh-heavenly. </p>\n<p>\nStroke her lightly with your fingers - you build more sexual tension swirling them gently all over her body. Build to a firmer touch checking that she wants it. </p>\n<p>\nPretend you're her \"sex doctor\" discovering what makes her \"feel better\". Turning exploring her body into foreplay. Keep asking her what feels good and where. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you're both ready for full sex let her select the position - all students should check out my recommendation below. Give her \"permission\" to take charge of the action. Remember you can always have your pleasure once she has hers! </p>\n<p>\nThe must-know equation: understanding your body + sharing that knowledge = climax guaranteed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: By the time a couple's been together two years how much less sex do they have then when they first met? Is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 10% less sex </p>\n<p>\nB) 90% less sex </p>\n<p>\nC) 50% less sex </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is C) - they have half as much sex as when they were in the hot honeymoon phase! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSometimes a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do in the name of love! </p>\n<p>\nThe Hoff's girlfriend Hayden Roberts quit her job behind Debenham's makeup counter because bosses wouldn't give her enough time off to spend with David. It must've been makeup brushes at dawn as she stood up for her love. </p>\n<p>\nIn this case she's got her priorities right because sometimes love has to come first. I hear from too many women with bitter regrets having put their careers first. </p>\n<p>\nYou've got to look at the circumstances and sometimes they're so unique you need to make tough decisions. </p>\n<p>\nHow many Hollywood hunks - even the ageing ones - is Haley going to meet? And heck the Hoff looks like fun now he's cleaned up his act! </p>\n<p>\nIf things ever go pear-shaped and Haley doesn't get her happy-ever-after with the Hoff she's smart enough to know that there are other make-up counters and department stores - and men - out there. Food for thought if you find yourself weighing up the pros and cons of whether someone's worth making sacrifices for. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The CAT</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe Coital Alignment Technique (or Clitoral Alignment Technique as some call it) is the perfect choice this week  it's simple yet almost guaranteed to give her a climax. </p>\n<p>\nShe can either be on top or the bottom - but if she has difficulty climaxing I recommend she goes on top. He lies flat on the bed, her on top - sort of a \"reversed\" missionary position. She can have her legs inside his or outside of his. </p>\n<p>\nHaving them inside his legs squeezes his penis [edit, manhood?] fairly tightly so she should be careful how much pressure she uses. She then shimmies a couple centimetres up his pelvis so that her pubic bone rubs against his pubic bone. </p>\n<p>\nHe can reach around her hips and hold her in place - for a little added pleasure he can squeeze her buttocks gently. She controls the action using small circular or rocking movements. </p>\n<p>\nThe CAT allows her full control of the sensations she gets. It also slows him down so he doesn't climax too quickly allowing her to get the right stimulation to climax. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's a bit lazy he can have a rest while she goes on top and takes over! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steamy-Sex-Doctors-Answers-Keeping/dp/1907532242/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288191214&amp;sr=1-5\">HERE</a>.

A whopping 94 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women confess to them... the rest are fibbing saying they don't have them. </p>\n<p>\nSo today's lesson is all about fantasy-chat to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nTiming's crucial - if your partner's just confessed undying love it's not the best time to mention your kinky bondage fantasy. But in the middle of fun foreplay? Definitely ask if they have \"naughty thoughts\" about secret desires. Using words like \"naughty thoughts\" is gentler than diving-in asking about fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nUse what you're already doing to kickstart fantasy-chat. If you're gently rubbing massage oil on them describe lying on a tropical beach and they're a sexy stranger who comes over to flirt. They begin rubbing suntan oil into you - you end up slipping off for amazing sex. Hopefully such chat will get your partner in the mood for sharing their fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nVariety's the spice of life - don't always describe the same scenario as that can get boring. The whole point of fantasy-sharing is roaming into fresh territory. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 2:</b> Students shouldn't upset a partner by describing fantasies of sex with their fave celeb or a hot fantasy about your neighbour! No, no, a 1000 times no - it's very bad bedroom manners. Your partner should feature prominently in your fantasies - at least the ones you share with them. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise. </p>\n<p>\nA healthy fantasy life has benefits: </p>\n<p>\n* It helps you escape sexual boredom </p>\n<p>\n* You get double the pleasure - you share your secret fantasies and they share theirs </p>\n<p>\n* When your partner's away fantasy-chat makes phone-sex more fun </p>\n<p>\n* In your private fantasies you can be with anyone - even people you'll never meet like your favourite celeb </p>\n<p>\n* Sharing fantasies gives you two fresh ideas to try - like some role-play </p>\n<p>\n* It's free! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge  when feeling confident to share your fantasy, describe one that boosts your partner's sexual confidence. </p>\n<p>\nToday's homework is to dream one up ahead of time - then when you're next in bed together whisper, e.g., \"You're so gorgeous I fantasise I'm a photographer and you're a model. I chat you up and start undressing you.\" This type of fantasy makes them feel fab - and that's the point. </p>\n<p>\nOne of you is probably more confident so by all means \"go first\" describing your fantasy. But emphasise you really want to hear theirs. Turn it into a game where you have to guess their fantasy. This can reveal all sorts of juicy stuff to chat about. </p>\n<p>\nAnother great game is taking turns deciding the next twist in a fantasy scenario. E.g. you start by describing how you get lost and go into a bar to ask directions. </p>\n<p>\nNo prize for guessing there's a really sexy stranger (who looks like your partner - remember your manners!) sitting at the bar who starts chatting you up. Now your partner says what happens next, and so on. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your fantasies + their fantasies = endless fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many under-30s have had sex with a friend - in other words \"friends with fringe benefits\"- is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 66 % </p>\n<p>\nB) 6 % </p>\n<p>\nC) 36 % </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A) - one study found a whopping two thirds of under-30s has been more-than-friendly with a friend! The 50+ generation's at it too, with nine per cent confessing to sex with a friend recently. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nKate Moss has joined new hubby Jamie Hince on tour Down Under. Like most newlyweds smack in the middle of the honeymoon phase they can't bear to be apart. But it's the transition from hot honeymoon phase to long-term love - with all its ups and downs, that's tricky. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you feel the fizz and fun fading that's when you should show a little extra love, attention and affection. </p>\n<p>\nDon't neglect each other but be realistic about finding a balance between what you once had - complete 'hot-ness'. And something lasting - a loving warmth where you occasionally turn up the heat! </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Strip Search</b> </p>\n<p>\nPerfect to try after the fantasy lesson above. Pretend he's a detective and she's a sexy suspect who needs searching. She leans against a wall, in a standing position, her back to him. </p>\n<p>\nHe enters from behind - leaning a hand against the wall for support or wrapping his arms around her waist to hold her tight. </p>\n<p>\nShe should keep her high heels on - it's sexy and it makes it easier for him to start the action. </p>\n<p>\nDouble her sensations by nuzzling the back of her neck as he gently moves. Plus he can 'search' her with his free hand roaming her body. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Steamy-Sex-Doctors-Answers-Keeping/dp/1907532242/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288191214&amp;sr=1-5\">HERE.</a> </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.drpam.co.uk\">www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>Sex Lessons: Week 1 </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>My Partner Isn't Interested in Sex</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt's NOT a nice feeling when your partner turns down sex. Inside you get a bit paranoid thinking: \"Am I a sex maniac, wanting too much?\" Or \"Don't they fancy me anymore?\" </p>\n<p>\nWomen are particularly bad about blaming themselves when he loses interest. Whereas the fellas are less worried about blame - they just want to sort out more sex! </p>\n<p>\nAcademy rule No. 1: Don't point the finger of blame for lack of sex at yourself or your partner. You're in this together, you'll sort it together. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist of passion-killing culprits every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n* Problems in your relationship (at each other's throats and you won't be at it!) </p>\n<p>\n* Trouble at work/financial worries </p>\n<p>\n* Not enough sleep or time together (a good chance the Beckham's are experiencing this one) </p>\n<p>\n* Too many late nights including too much booze and cigs </p>\n<p>\n* Boredom with the same old sex and/or feeling shy about trying new things </p>\n<p>\n* Medical problems and/or side-effects of prescription medication </p>\n<p>\n* Stress, anxiety and/or depression (face it, when you're down you don't feel sexy) </p>\n<p>\n* Erectile difficulties for the man meaning he avoids sex </p>\n<p>\nMost of these affect the way you feel and think i.e. your brain action. Research shows how powerfully our brains affect sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\nPut a hot, naked woman in front of a depressed man and his brain won't switch on his arousal centre. What hope has his wife of five, ten, or more, years got? </p>\n<h3>\nHot &amp; Helpful Homework: </h3>\n<p>\nIt's time for applying your new knowledge - thoroughly examine the checklist and get stuck in with the main culprit. If a number of these are affecting your sex life, focus on changing one at a time. </p>\n<p>\nStudy example: Let's say you're having lots of arguments plus partying too much at weekends - ending up hungover. </p>\n<p>\nWhen calm, agree with each other that the arguing must stop. Then look at what starts arguments (Household chores? Money?) and work out solutions together. </p>\n<p>\nBe the first to be affectionate and loving to your partner despite the rows. Making these efforts will have big payoffs. </p>\n<p>\nThinking of our example - arguments and partying  next knock excess drinking on the head. A hangover on a Sunday morning doesn't lead to Sunday afternoon delight! Agree a drinks limit and help each other stick to it. </p>\n<p>\nWhen things are better, recharge the spark. Make regular time for each other, get cosy on the settee, and whisper in their ear how much you miss that \"thing\" they do best in bed. </p>\n<p>\nTease them a little, let your fingertips gently run over their erogenous zones, and keep up the sexy banter. Full sex should be back on the agenda soon. But consult your GP about ongoing health issues that might affect desire. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many couples now regularly use oral sex to guarantee the woman's satisfaction - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 45% </p>\n<p>\nB) 20% </p>\n<p>\nC) 69% </p>\n<p>\nA: The correct answer is B. Twenty per cent of men in a relationship now use oral sex to make sure their partner has a good time between the sheets - just what the doctor ordered! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSo Brad and Angelina are getting hitched six years and six children into their relationship. Is it a case of better late than never? </p>\n<p>\nSadly it's not great news for the two most gorgeous celebrities to grace our good earth. Relationship research shows couples that leave getting married longer than 3 1/2 years are pretty much doomed. </p>\n<p>\nAny why? Because leaving it that long suggests one of them's dragged their feet about fully committing¿ whether it's her Jimmy Choo-clad feet daintily dodging the aisle we may never know. </p>\n<p>\nJust beware the partner who keeps putting off full commitment. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight:</b> <b>The Cow Girl</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHave loads of fun with this position where the girl's on top. He lies flat on his back and she straddles him, facing him. A perfect position for a 'boob-man' as he has great access to his partner's and can caress her during sex. </p>\n<p>\nShe gently glides up and down as passion builds. He steadies the action by holding her hips. This is a perfect position for her to control the pace of things.

The general principle is that 80 per cent of savings should come from expenditure, 20 per cent from tax.\" </p>\n<p>\nThe veteran insisted the UK economy was \"gradually recovering\" but warned it was still vulnerable  to both the euro crisis and the price of oil. </p>\n<p>\nAnd he urged the Chancellor to do his duty  and tackle the spiralling petrol price. </p>\n<p>\nDuty is due to rise by another 3p this August despite record costs at the pump. Sir Terry said: \"Duty hikes have to be re-thought at this level of oil price. </p>\n<p>\n\"There has to be a regulator. I don't mean in terms of a person, but where the tax take goes down when the oil price goes up. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's hitting consumers' expenditure, but also their confidence. If people are putting money in the tank they're not putting it in the trolley.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said the inflation-busting increase in business rates paid by stores had to be reviewed  they're due to rise another 5.6 per cent in April.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he said cutting the 50p tax would encourage high earners. He said \"The Government needs to set out its stall, show Britain is a competitively taxed economy, where people want to invest, where they want to set up a business.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSir Terry quit Tesco last year and is now involved in ten separate ventures, including setting up shopping centres in China. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nEconomy is working ... for us </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE Tories' favourite ad agency claims Britain IS on the mend. </p>\n<p>\n<b>M&amp;C SAATCHI</b> said yesterday that businesses were beginning to spend again  and were trying to gain market share. </p>\n<p>\nBoss David Kershaw told Sun City: \"Companies feel a bit better, they don't believe there will be a double dip.\" </p>\n<p>\nProfits rose 17 per cent to &#163;15.6million on work with clients such as <b>GOOGLE</b>. </p>\n<p>\nUK revenues are expected to climb 11 per cent this year. The Saatchi brothers were the architects of the infamous \"Labour Isn't Working\" campaign that helped Maggie Thatcher to power in 1979. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Mr Kershaw said he still believes the Tories are THE party for business. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"The Conservatives are the most business friendly.

The Chancellor announced the 50p top rate of tax will drop to 45p from April 2013. </p>\n<p>\nAs he announced the cut to the 50 per cent rate, Osborne also closed a number of loopholes and reliefs which he claimed would raise five times more from the wealthy. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>'Stealth-tax'</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Government stood accused of an \"outrageous stealth tax\" after it emerged that more than four million people who are about to become pensioners will be worse off following changes to simplify the tax system unveiled in the Budget. </p>\n<p>\nAt the moment, people over the age of 65 are not taxed on the first &#163;10,500 of their income, but this will be frozen for existing pensioners - and from next April new pensioners will have a tax-free allowance of only &#163;9,205, bringing them into line with the general population. </p>\n<p>\nAround half of pensioners will be affected by the changes, which will raise around &#163;1billion annually for the Government. </p>\n<p>\nSaga director-general Dr Ros Altmann said: \"This is an outrageous assault on decent middle-class pensioners. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Budget contains an enormous stealth tax for older people. Over the next five years, pensioners with an income of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;24,000 will be paying an extra &#163;3billion in tax while richer pensioners are left unaffected. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing in this Budget for savers, there is nothing to improve the annuity market, nothing to appease the damage of quantitative easing and nothing to support ISA changes and shelter older people's money in cash. This Budget is terrible news for pensioners.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, the basic state pension will be increased by &#163;5.30 a week. </p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne had earlier said the Budget would be good for the UK. \"This Budget rewards work. Britain is going to earn its way in the world.\" he told Parliament. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is no other road to recovery. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Budget supports working families and helps those looking for work. </p>\n<p>\n\"It unashamedly backs business.

Delage says if that doesn't happen, police will force their way in to arrest him. <br></br>\nIt has been reported that he has since said he will give himself up later this evening.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe refused to surrender this morning and later threw a handgun out of the window and declared he would surrender this afternoon but the situation has reached a stalemate. </p>\n<p>\nThe siege in the Croix-Daurade district of Toulouse came two days after a single gunman massacred Rabbi Jonathan Sandler, 30, his sons aged six and three, and a girl of eight at a Jewish school in the city. </p>\n<p>\nHe was filmed on CCTV riding a stolen scooter and switching weapons when one jammed. </p>\n<p>\nHe also killed three soldiers in two separate attacks in the region last week. The same weapon, a Colt 45, and the same bike were used in all three. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFrench Interior Minister Claude Gueant said the suspect \"wants to take revenge for Palestinian children\" killed in the Middle East, and is angry at the French military for its operations abroad. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGueant said he is thought to be armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a Mini-Uzi 9mm machine pistol and other handguns, but had thrown a .45 pistol he used to murder seven people in recent weeks from the window. </p>\n<p>\nThe minister said the gunman had stopped talking to police. He added that French authorities had been monitoring him for years. </p>\n<p>\nTwo officers sustained minor knee and shoulder injuries during the shootout and the man's brother has been arrested. </p>\n<p>\nThe suspect's mother has also been taken to the scene to negotiate with him. But she refused, saying she \"had little influence on him\". </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMr Gueant also revealed the gunman said \"he belongs to al-Qaeda\" and was known to the authorities after spending time in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Cops swooped on the property last night close to the scene of the first attack. </p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"When they arrived, the wanted individual shot at the door.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the raid got underway overnight, the bodies of the victims of the latest shooting arrived in Israel for burial today. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe victims were paratroopers Cpl Abel Chennouf, Sgt Imad Ibn Ziaten and Pte Mohamed Legouad. </p>\n<p>\nThen on Monday Rabbi Jonathan Sandler, 30, his sons Gavriel and Aryeh, six and three, and the principal of the Jewish school's daughter Miriam Monsonego, eight, were shot dead. </p>","timestamp":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 06:52:14 +0000","byline":"By NEIL MILLARD","teaser":"FRENCH police exchange gunfire in stand-off with man suspected of killing three people in Toulouse","headline":"French cops 'prepare to storm siege flat'","id":4208538,"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4208538/French-cops-prepare-to-storm-siege-flat.html?iPadApp=true","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/Toulouse-MAIN_1474894a.jpg","imagelarge":true,"imageportrait":false}],"id":"breaking-news","name":"Breaking News"}]}
