Abu Hamza and others should be put on a plane and extradited to the US regardless of the court’s decision.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Fellow Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris added: “We should tell them to stick their judgment where political correctness doesn’t shine — and send Hamza to the US to receive justice.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nUS authorities have described Hamza as a “terrorist facilitator with a global reach” and have been trying to get him extradited since 2004. </p>\n<p>\nHe faces charges related to taking 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998, promoting violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001 and conspiring to set up a jihad training camp in Oregon. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are fears of a repeat of the Abu Qatada deportation madness if Strasbourg rules in Hamza’s favour. </p>\n<p>\nHe is currently in Belmarsh high-security prison in Woolwich, South East London, after being jailed in 2006 for incitement to murder. </p>\n<p>\nBut he is eligible for parole and could be out in weeks — just before the Olympics — if the unelected Euro judges block extradition. Britain then has three months to appeal against the decidion.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur judges may decide to <b>FREE</b> all six terror suspects on bail if the meantime. That is how al-Qaeda lynchpin Abu Qatada won his freedom in February. </p>\n<p>\nMrs May has been forced into protracted negotiations with Jordan, where Qatada is wanted. </p>\n<p>\nShe is trying to convince the Euro court that evidence against him won’t have been obtained by torture.\n</p>\n<p>\nCops and MI5 have had to mount expensive surveillance operations in the meantime — and could now be forced to do the same with Hamza. </p>\n<p>\nIn striking contrast, French authorities recently removed two Islamists considered a threat to national security, despite also signing the human rights convention. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the Italian government deported a former Islamist prisoner to Tunisia, even though it contravened a Euro court ruling. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Jackson said: “We should take a leaf out of the French book. The ultimate say should be with British judges. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“If it means ignoring the human rights court we should do that. I hope Theresa May takes that on board. It’s the people’s will.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe scandal follows other human rights rulings that make a mockery of our fight to rid the country of foreign-born criminals. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun has led calls to sling out Hamza — the former infamous hate preacher at Finsbury Park Mosque in London — since 2003. </p>\n<p>\nThe Home Office said: “We can confirm the European Court of Human Rights judgments in the cases of Abu Hamza and five others are due to be given on April 10. All have appealed against extradition to the US.”\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nt.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n13yrs bid to jail him </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>CALLS to jail Abu Hamza go back as far as 1999 when three British tourists were killed in Yemen. </p>\n<p>\nThe Muslim fanatic was held responsible after his vile rantings. Hook arrived in Britain in 1983 and developed extreme beliefs. In 1990 he returned to his homeland Egypt. </p>\n<p>\nOn returning in the 90s, he claimed he lost an eye and hand from battling jihad in Afghanistan. Hamza began preaching jihad at Finsbury Park, recruiting youngsters. </p>\n<p>\nHe was jailed for seven years in 2006 for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred. But he was first arrested in 2004, when US extradition proceedings began. He appealed against extradition in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nNow he is eligible for parole on the UK charges and is only locked up due to the US extradition bid. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nFive more moaners </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>THE five other terror suspects held in the UK who are bleating to the European Court of Human Rights are: </p>\n<p>\n<b>Babar Ahmad</b>: Accused by America of leading a “terrorism support cell”. He won a stay on his US extradition at the European court in June 2007. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Syed Ahsan</b>: He is accused of supporting terrorists and helping Babar Ahmad. He was arrested in July 2006 — and his extradition ordered in June 2007. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Khalid Al Fawwaz</b>: Faces charges over bombings of US Embassies in East Africa in 1998. Ordered to the US in 2008, but his extradition was halted the next year. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Adel Abdul Bary</b>: Arrested for same alleged offences as Al Fawwaz. Got extradition orders in 2008. ECHR put a stay on extradition in December 2009. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Haroon Aswat</b>: Charged with helping Hamza plan a terror camp in Oregon. Extradition to US ordered in March 2006.

Then he would send me a text message saying how sexy I looked. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“He would message me saying things like: ‘I want to chuck everyone off this bus so I can drive you somewhere quiet to have sex.’</i> </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wouldn’t agree because I knew that there were cameras on the bus and the control centre would be able to see us. But it didn’t stop him trying.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe relationship with Alison took place last summer behind the back of David’s partner Linda. Alison had split from her husband Wayne. </p>\n<p>\nThe pair kept the relationship quiet by meeting at David’s home and spending the day in bed together while his partner was at work. </p>\n<p>\nBut after his mega-bucks win, David was keen to portray himself as a family man. Following the windfall his brother Graham spoke about how David wanted to “buy a new car and look after his family”. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Alison — who has moved away from the area to St Neots, Cambridgeshire — said: “There were pictures of David and Linda all over the house. He didn’t bother to hide them. I knew about her anyway. </p>\n<p>\n“I wasn’t proud of what we were doing but I felt really alone at the time because I had just separated from my husband. David gave me a lot of attention and made me feel special. </p>\n<p>\n“He told me he loved everything about my body, he loved curves. </p>\n<p>\n“We spent whole days in the bed he shared with Linda while she was out. He thought I was great because I would use sex toys with him.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pair met through Alison’s ex-husband who worked at the same bus depot as David. When The Sun approached David at his home in Corby he said that the couple had sex just once. </p>\n<p>\nHe also claimed he had told Linda about the affair, saying their relationship was “open” and she had forgiven him. </p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>GOT</b> a story?

But the full extent of the problem is far greater. </p>\n<p>\nThe figures do not account for GP consultations or those seeking help in private clinics. </p>\n<p>\n<i>And vast numbers endure the dangerous disorders in silence.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is now estimated that 20 per cent of the 1.6million people with eating disorders in the UK are male. </p>\n<p>\nYet authorities still place a far higher emphasis on identifying female sufferers. </p>\n<p>\nLast year we revealed that boys as young as ten were falling victim to bulimia. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors warned then that the true problem was “hidden” as many boys did not tell anyone about their illness. </p>\n<p>\nExperts say growing scrutiny of male bodies in the media, fashion trends like skinny-fit jeans, and the need to post photos on social networking sites have helped fuel the rise in eating disorders. </p>\n<p>\nThe condition can also be caused by stress brought on by events such as exams or relationship problems. </p>\n<p>\nSufferers often develop crushingly low self-esteem and become withdrawn. </p>\n<p>\nBut experts say the conditions are successfully treatable — particularly when they are identified in the early stages. </p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>MOST</b> popular diets don’t work — while non-prescription weight-loss pills and diet foods and products just as useless, according to a US study. Eating less fat, exercising more and using prescribed diet drugs were found to be far more effective. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<i>a.france@the-sun.co.uk</a></i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>By SAM THOMAS, Founder of the charity MGEDT</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHERE is still a lot of stigma attached to eating disorders. </p>\n<p>\nStereotypical assumptions can make it more difficult for male sufferers to seek help. </p>\n<p>\nThey may not be able to recognise symptoms easily and GPs may also be less aware of the signs. Worries over money, relationships, self-image and identity are all causes. </p>\n<p>\nMen may feel more pressure due to a growing trend focusing on the ideal body image. </p>\n<p>\nWhile negative body image alone is not responsible for causing eating disorders, it magnifies insecurities and reinforces low feelings of self-worth. </p>\n<p>\nEating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental health condition.

My mam would give us a slap if she saw me in my bra in a magazine.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJade, also from South Shields, added: “I think you have to earn your sexual respect. We’re not exactly at the stage where we could get away with doing something like that and have people concentrate on our music. </p>\n<p>\n“Little Mix’s first single all naked? Can you imagine?”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn a world where the music channels are dominated by sexed-up stars gyrating in their underwear, Little Mix are a breath of fresh air. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Their dressing room is not hard to find.</i> H<i>air straighteners sit on every surface, big boxes of make-up are piled high and overflowing girly suitcases are everywhere.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe only surprise is the totally demolished rider tray, strewn with empty crisp packets, cola bottles and biscuit wrappers — unheard of for other diet-obsessed girlbands. </p>\n<p>\nFor four young women in the spotlight, they have an extremely healthy attitude towards eating. </p>\n<p>\nThat goes especially for Jesy who, despite attracting nasty comments about her figure since first appearing on TV last year, is determined to stay curvy as a message to her female fans. Even though she has dropped a few pounds since the show finished</a>, the singer from Romford, Essex, insists she has not tried to lose weight. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “People are always commenting on how I look and it’s because I’m a girl. You never see men’s bodies being criticised in magazines. </p>\n<p>\n“Once I came off the TV show everyone thought I was on a strict diet but I’d just stopped going to the ITV canteen every day, with fry-ups every morning and chips for lunch, so I lost quite a bit of weight. I’m not going to suddenly become skinny — we’re all different shapes and sizes in the band and people relate to us because we look normal. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s one of the reasons we won the show. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“If I started to look like I’d lost two stone it would send out the wrong message.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt’s surprising the girls find time to eat these days, since being formed for the show and bagging the prize they have barely had a minute spare. This time just a year ago between them they were waitressing, working as barmaids and finishing college courses. </p>\n<p>\nFast forward 12 months and they have a No1 single under their belts and are about to start work on a group autobiography. </p>\n<p>\nAnd there’s no let-up any time soon. </p>\n<p>\nThe X Factor tour completed its final show on Friday night, so now the girls are focusing full-time on putting the finishing touches to their debut album. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWith such hectic work schedules, it’s little surprise that three out of the four girls have decided against the distractions of having a boyfriend. </p>\n<p>\nOnly Jesy is currently in a relationship, after recently getting together with Jordan Banjo, a member of the BGT dance troupe Diversity. </p>\n<p>\nBoth Perrie and Jade have seen long-term relationships end since becoming famous. Jade split with her boyfriend of five years just two months ago after it became too difficult to juggle with her career. </p>\n<p>\n<i>And the girls have now sworn off boys for the time being. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nLeigh-Anne, from High Wycombe, Bucks, said: “Each of us are the most important thing to us right now. We’re very career orientated. With all of this going on we don’t have time for boyfriends. </p>\n<p>\n“The strangest thing recently is having guys at concerts who are interested in us. </p>\n<p>\n“At the beginning it had been all girl fans, so we’re not very good with that kind of attention yet. </p>\n<p>\n“Someone grabbed Jade’s arm at our concert the other night and shouted, ‘I want you!’ She just kind of screamed and ran on to the stage. We all burst out laughing.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe girls are so close that although they have spent the past eight months in each other’s pockets 24 hours a day, the plan is to become neighbours. </p>\n<p>\nThey are scouring London for two apartments side by side. Jade said: “We’re living out of a suitcase. We each have ten suitcases that follow us around, which is just the worst thing — all I want to do is hang up my clothes. </p>\n<p>\n“We are going to move to London permanently very soon and get two apartments right next to each other. Me and Perrie are going to share and so are Leigh-Anne and Jesy. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“If the four of us all lived together the place would be a total pigsty.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAlongside permanently living out of suitcases, constantly performing in thick stage make-up is also something the girls will be glad to see the back of. </p>\n<p>\nEach of them is struggling to control outbreaks of spots since starting The X Factor tour. </p>\n<p>\nLeigh-Anne explained: “Because we wear such thick make-up on stage, when we sweat under the lights it makes our skin really bad. You have to try to eat healthily and get enough sleep, otherwise it can get out of control. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m using antibiotics because otherwise I would actually have really bad skin. It should hopefully go back to normal now we’ve stopped performing all the time.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFortunately for the girls, if they have any questions about touring, boys or the hardships of fame, they have one of the most experienced young women in showbusiness just a phone call away. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTulisa Contostavlos, who acted as the band’s mentor on the ITV competition, has been a constant in their lives since the cameras stopped rolling. And that is extremely unusual for a talent show judge. </p>\n<p>\nContestants of similar programmes have complained of being dropped as protégés after leaving a series. But Tulisa has a hands-on approach to her “little muffins”. </p>\n<p>\nEven on the day of my interview, despite having to deal with the fallout of her embarrassing sex tape being leaked online, she finds time to check out the X Factor show and visit the band backstage. </p>\n<p>\nPerrie said: “She’s really great, we’re always on the phone to her. </p>\n<p>\n“Things have been difficult recently but she’s been such a trooper — she’s the most real person ever and I think her strength is why we won the show in the first place. </p>\n<p>\n“We formed such a strong bond with her, she’s not a mentor any more, she’s a really good friend.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe group have also bumped into X Factor judges Gary Barlow and Louis Walsh since the final. </p>\n<p>\nJade said: “It’s weird when you see them after the show because there isn’t that pressure any more. It’s like when you see a teacher after you’ve left school.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the thought of meeting one particular music mogul sent shivers down the girls’ spines — their label boss Simon Cowell. They met with the X Factor guru last month to discuss their music career. </p>\n<p>\nPerrie said: “Meeting Simon was like waiting outside the principal’s office. We felt like naughty schoolgirls and were all so scared that we could hardly breathe. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I don’t know why we thought Simon was going to be this monster. It was just amazing how normal he is.”</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>c.mcguire@the-sun.co.uk</b></a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4235649/Simons-mix-tips-for-Little-Mix.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Simon’s mix tips"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4231087/Little-Mix-to-release-autobiography.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Little Mix to release autobiography"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4175027/Little-Mix-Jesy-picks-up-Banjo.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Little Mix Jesy picks up Banjo"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4156008/Girl-power-in-Manchester.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Girl power in Manchester"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4246163/Little-Mix-go-for-mean-and-moody-look.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Little miffed"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01485/SNF07LITTLE-532_1485967a.jpg","caption":"Mixing it up ...

Megan Fox says she enjoyed working on a comedy film","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/MeganFox_01_1486985a.jpg","section":"showbiz","headline":"Comedy is refreshing","teaser":"MEGAN Fox says role in The Dictator is a refreshing change from playing ice maidens","byline":"BY JENNA SLOAN","timestamp":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 00:13:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nMEGAN FOX spent years building up her image as an ice-cold sex goddess, but now finally has the chance to laugh at herself — and she couldn’t be more relieved. </p>\n<p>\nIn Sacha Baron Cohen’s new comedy film the beauty plays a stuck-up hooker who gets into a huff when she is paid with rubies rather than diamonds. </p>\n<p>\nThe character fumes: “What am I, a Kardashian?”. </p>\n<p>\nIt is just a cameo, but being able to get laughs out of her rather humour-free image is a joy for the Hollywood beauty. </p>\n<p>\nMegan, 25, says: “When I first started acting I was always playing the bitchy or mean girl, then I was playing these cool, robotic women. </p>\n<p>\n“I was growing tired of playing those kinds of characters and reinforcing this stereotype of me and having to play up to that when I was doing interviews. </p>\n<p>\n“Now I feel I can be myself again. It’s given me the chance to get away from that sexy, icy image that I’ve been stuck with. </p>\n<p>\n“I think the public can relate to me more easily in these kinds of movies.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe actress also loved working with Baron Cohen — who plays deluded “supreme leader” Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen in The Dictator. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I had a wonderful time. Sacha is very smart and funny. We had a great time working together. </p>\n<p>\n“I think audiences are going to love the film.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMegan adds: “I’m discovering that I enjoy the atmosphere of being part of those kinds of films. </p>\n<p>\n“Doing comedies has been a great change of pace for me and I’m interested to see how audiences react to seeing me in these kinds of films. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m really enjoying my work again and I feel a lot of good things are happening to me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSuch a feeling has been a long time coming. </p>\n<p>\nMegan admits that she never enjoyed the years she felt obliged to play up to the serious, sex-vixen image. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough she had modelled and acted since she was 15, she was hurtled into the global limelight when she won the role as Shia LaBeouf’s action sidekick Mikaela in Transformers in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nShe admits: “I just didn’t know how to handle the attention or make that image work for me. I felt I was suddenly living a double life and I was expected to behave a certain way. I just couldn’t be like that. </p>\n<p>\n“I have a hard time holding back what I really think. I don’t like the idea of censoring myself and not speaking my mind or being humorous when I’m doing interviews. </p>\n<p>\n“I’ve paid the price for being very open about my feelings.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMost spectacularly, her openness backfired when, in a magazine interview in 2009, she likened Tranformers director Michael Bay to Hitler. </p>\n<p>\nShe was immediately fired from the franchise by its executive producer, Steven Spielberg. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, to make matters worse, three anonymous crew members on the films then posted a letter online calling her “dumb as a rock” and slamming her behaviour on set. </p>\n<p>\nWhen asked what she has learned from these kinds of lows, Megan says: “To not be so bold and outspoken when it comes to talking about certain things. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m a passionate individual and sometimes when I have strong feelings about a subject I feel the need to express myself. </p>\n<p>\n“But I’ve learnt that it’s better to hold back a bit, that the world doesn’t necessarily need or want to know what I think about some matters. </p>\n<p>\n“I still believe in being very honest and speaking my mind. I think that’s a good quality even if sometimes it has gotten me into trouble.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAs well as the new comedy gig, Megan is also still modelling. She is the face of Armani and also regularly tops lists of the world’s hottest women. </p>\n<p>\nBut Megan reckons her red-blooded male fans have the wrong idea about her two best features. </p>\n<p>\nShe says with a grin: “I like my eyes the best. I love playing with different make-up styles for my eyes and seeing how I can make them stand out. </p>\n<p>\n“As a young girl, I was always frustrated at not being able to steal my mom’s make-up because she never had any. </p>\n<p>\n“So getting into modelling and acting has allowed me to fulfil all my make-up dreams.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThese days Megan is nearly as famous for her body art as for her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe has at least ten tattoos including designs on her ribs and shoulder. </p>\n<p>\nBut she is currently getting a portrait of Marilyn Monroe on her right forearm removed, claiming it causes “negativity”. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the process has been painful. </p>\n<p>\nMegan explains: “Removing the tattoo is a hundred times worse than getting the tattoo itself. I think it will come off really easily, though, and I’m not going to put something over it. </p>\n<p>\n“I have the right skin type for removing it, so I think it will look fine. They tell you when you come in that the more fair your skin is, the easier it is to remove. </p>\n<p>\n“I’ve got three or four more sessions left to go. Even though I still love Marilyn Monroe, I was just over having the tattoo of her. I got it when I was 18, and now I’m 25.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA big part of that growing-up process has been her relationship with former Beverly Hills 90210 star Brian Austin Green. </p>\n<p>\nThe couple have been together for seven years and got married in 2010. She is reportedly now expecting his child — but both Megan and Brian refuse to comment on the rumours. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, the actress is more than happy to gush about life as “mom” to young stepson Kassius – Brian’s son by 90210 actress Vanessa Marcil. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “A lot of things make me happy. But I feel unbelievably happy when my nine-year-old stepson tells me I’m beautiful. Kassius is one of the most beautiful things about my life. </p>\n<p>\n“When I started living with Brian, his son was only two and I was 18. But ever since I’ve felt like we’ve created this family together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I’ve basically been looking after Kassius since he was three and that’s part of my world that very few people really ever understood about me. </p>\n<p>\n“I love being a stepmom and I feel that the experience grounds me when nothing else makes sense in my life.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe other grounding influence is her religious faith. </p>\n<p>\nMegan, who was brought up in a strict Pentecostal family in Tennessee, reveals: “I’ve always found it strange that different Christian groups can look at each other in an antagonistic way. </p>\n<p>\n“I think all religions have common principles and an overriding faith in God, so I’ve tried to use religion in a non-restrictive, very open way. </p>\n<p>\n“I go regularly to a church in Los Angeles which is very open and non-judgmental. There I meet a lot of other young people who are looking to share their faith and find common meaning with other people. </p>\n<p>\n“Religion can be a beautiful thing.”\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nGrating dictator </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\nSACHA BARON COHEN’S latest creation – a crazed Middle Eastern dictator – has already caused Borat-style havoc around the world. </p>\n<p>\nThe latest stunt has seen gigantic portraits of despot Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen go up around the UK and the US. </p>\n<p>\nLooking like tributes put up to real Middle East dictators the posters – surrounded by guilt frames – give no hint that they are spoof ads for the movie. They do not include the title or the May 18 opening date. </p>\n<p>\nPromotion for the movie started early. In February, the British comedian turned up on the red carpet at the Oscars in character. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was carrying an urn he said containing the ashes of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il – which he spilled over the designer suit of horrified TV host Ryan Seacrest. </p>\n<p>\nThen came the release of the movie’s website – which looks like a serious site for Aladeen’s (fictional) fiefdom, the Republic of Wadyia. </p>\n<p>\nIt contains links to Victoria’s Secret, described by the Wadyians as a site for “high class hookers”. Then there is a link to the UN, which is marked up as a comedy website. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt is not the first time the 40 year old, who first found fame as Ali G, has conducted bizarre publicity stunts for his films. </p>\n<p>\nWhen promoting Borat in 2006 he arrived at the Toronto film festival in character as the Kazakhstani TV host in rickety cart pulled by “peasant women”. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>j.sloan@the-sun.co.uk</b></a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4192011/Megan-Fox-serves-up-a-tasty-treat-in-new-advert.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Megan Fox serves up a tasty treat in new advert"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4225465/Is-Megan-Fox-expecting-a-baby.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Is Megan Fox expecting a baby?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4225048/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-stars-in-new-trailer-to-The-Dictator.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Dictator will rule screens this Spring"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4161957/Oscar-2012-news-Donald-trump-slams-Sacha-Baron-Cohens-Dictator-stunt.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Trump: Sacha Baron Cohen should be punched in the face"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4156432/Oscars-2012-Sacha-Baron-Cohens-The-Dictator-tips-ashes-on-Ryan-Seacrest.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Dictator urns his place in Oscar history"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/oscars/4151916/Oscars-2012-Sacha-Baron-Cohens-Dictator-hits-back.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Dictator hits back at Oscar ban"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/MeganFox_01_1486985a.jpg","caption":"Change of direction ...

It was a sick joke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“It broke my heart to admit it was over so quickly but I was very lucky to get out of my marriage alive. </p>\n<p>\n“I believe that once a man hits you, you should leave straight away. </p>\n<p>\n“Domestic violence must never be tolerated. </p>\n<p>\n“Since this has happened to me, I have learnt that two women a week die from domestic violence and that is so horrifying.”\n</p>\n<p>\nTammy, from Penrhiwceiber, South Wales, a full-time mum to four-year-old Adam, said: “I met Nicky at a party in 2009 and we clicked immediately. </p>\n<p>\n“I already had a little boy and Nicky was a natural father. He would sit and play with Adam for hours. My son adored him. </p>\n<p>\n“He did everything for me and always gave me fresh flowers. I couldn’t believe what a lucky girl I was. </p>\n<p>\n“Early in the relationship Nicky was kind and thoughtful. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“He was quite insecure that I would cheat on him but he had never laid a finger on me. </p>\n<p>\n“When Nicky got down on one knee after a five-month whirlwind relationship, I said yes straight away. I couldn’t wait to be his wife.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe couple got married in June 2010. </p>\n<p>\nTammy added: “I cried with joy as I walked down the aisle. I was marrying the man of my dreams. </p>\n<p>\n“It was the best moment of my life. </p>\n<p>\n“On our wedding day he promised to love, protect and care for me. </p>\n<p>\n“The next few days were heaven as we enjoyed a romantic honeymoon in a nearby hotel. </p>\n<p>\n“Nicky told me over and over how much he loved me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAfterwards, they visited chef Curly Thomas, 28, Pearce’s best man. Tammy said: “We had a lovely afternoon laughing and sharing a few drinks. </p>\n<p>\n“Nicky was silent on the way home, I thought it was because he had had too much to drink. </p>\n<p>\n“When we arrived back at the house he flipped. He started screaming and shouting that I was all over Curly. </p>\n<p>\n“I had never seen him so angry. I didn’t know who this man was. He certainly wasn’t the man I’d said my vows to four days earlier.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPearce threw Tammy against a door, gripped her around the neck and began to strangle her. </p>\n<p>\nTammy said: “He had his hands tightly around my throat and his face was contorted. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“He finally let go of me and I slumped to the floor, gasping for breath. </p>\n<p>\n“He then stormed through the house smashing every cupboard with his fist. Our beautiful wedding gifts were smashed and left shattered on the floor. </p>\n<p>\n“I cowered, begging him to calm down, but he hissed that he was going to kill me and then said, ‘If I can’t have you no one will.’\n</p><p>\n“With those terrifying words, he attacked me again, biting me and headbutting me in the face. </p>\n<p>\n“I thought I was going to die. I just prayed it would be over quickly.”\n</p>\n<p>\nTammy lost consciousness as she watched blood pour on to the floor from her injuries. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>If you or someone you know is a victim of </b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>domestic violence contact the national helpline on 0808 2000 247.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe added: “When I came round Nicky was gone. I stumbled into the street, screaming for help. </p>\n<p>\n“A neighbour took me in and called the police. I was rushed to hospital for treatment. </p>\n<p>\n“I was unrecognisable, my face was so swollen and battered. I couldn’t believe the man I loved had done this to me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nTammy had suffered a broken nose, severe bruises and bite marks covered her face and neck. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “The doctors were concerned my cheekbones were shattered from the bites but they couldn’t X-ray my face as it was so swollen. </p>\n<p>\n“The police later told me it was the worst case of domestic violence they had seen. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“They had caught Nicky on the night of the attack. </p>\n<p>\n“I realised how lucky I was to escape with my life — and to see my little boy again. </p>\n<p>\n“I was so relieved Adam hadn’t been in the house at the time to witness the horror. </p>\n<p>\n“Nicky almost managed to destroy my trust in men forever. It’s taken a long time to recover.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she is now learning to love again with painter and decorator Archie Andrews, 28. </p>\n<p>\nNow nine months pregnant, Tammy said: “Archie is the love of my life. </p>\n<p>\n“He is the sweetest, most protective, loving person I have ever met. </p>\n<p>\n“We will get married once my divorce papers are through. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“My painful memories of Nicky fade with every day and my four-day marriage seems like a very bad dream.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional reporting: JANE COHEN </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4220837/Agony-of-Tammy-bride-to-beaten-wife-in-four-days.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Agony of Tammy... bride to beaten wife in four days"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4207480/Rula-Lenskas-relief-over-Dennis-Watermans-domestic-abuse-admission.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Rula's relief over Waterman's domestic abuse admission"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4125069/Benidorm-news-Loose-Womens-Sherrie-Hewson-says-confidence-has-been-restored-after-acting-role-on-show.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I was beaten, betrayed and broke, now I’m back thanks to Benidorm'"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNF10WOMA_main_1486928a.jpg","caption":"Making a fresh start ... battered bride Tammy Driver"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNF10WOMC_532_1486932a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNF10WOMBAD_532_1486931a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNF10WOM_532_1486930a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNF10WOMWED_532_1486929a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Raunchy ... pop star Katy Perry","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01487/KP-532_1487087a.jpg","section":"woman","headline":"Kinky Katy Perry is no role model for our little girls","teaser":"RELATIONSHIP expert explains why she agrees with David Cameron’s call to put 18 certificates on music videos","byline":"By DR PAM SPURR","timestamp":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\n<b>DAVID CAMERON wants 18 certificates for raunchy music videos to stop children seeing explicit images of stars such as Katy Perry, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>He warns that they are sexualising kids and putting pressure on young girls to dress like scantily clad pop idols. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Here, a top behavioural expert explains why she agrees with Mr Cameron.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI AM constantly speaking to parents who are deeply concerned about their children’s behaviour and self-esteem being damaged by a tide of inappropriate music videos and sexual behaviour of celebrities in the spotlight. </p>\n<p>\nThey are distressed at how their child is learning to dress or behave in a promiscuous way because they are exposed to sexy pictures and videos on a daily basis. </p>\n<p>\nParents have little control over what they are watching — most of these raunchy videos are played throughout the day and acts like Lady Gaga and Rihanna perform regularly in skimpy outfits before the watershed. </p>\n<p>\nI completely agree with Cameron’s campaign. It’s time music videos were given a certificate rating. </p>\n<p>\nI recently spoke with a couple who were distressed at their 12-year-old daughter’s behaviour. They told me she wanted to dress like “a hooker” when she went to her school disco and that she wanted to be “sexy” like her friends. </p>\n<p>\nShe also put pressure on her mother to buy a top that was practically see-through, because Rihanna worse something similar in a video. </p>\n<p>\nThe parents were extremely upset at their little girl even knowing the meaning of the word “sexy”. </p>\n<p>\nBut they can do little to shield her from this way of thinking when her idols are portraying themselves in this way. This couple are not alone — this battle is being fought by parents across the country. They feel their kids are losing out on innocent childhoods because of pop stars. </p>\n<p>\nWhen Katy Perry is lying naked on a pink cloud singing about California girls wearing bikinis, it is a bad image for youngsters. </p>\n<p>\nThe parents I speak to find that their daughters are powerfully affected by the images and think it is a “cool” way to behave. </p>\n<p>\nAdolescence is a time when young people can be hugely influenced by popular culture and as a society we have a duty to protect them from this negative way of behaving. </p>\n<p>\nIf they are constantly seeing gorgeous women gyrating in outfits suitable for lap-dancing clubs, this becomes the norm.

I think she has cared for them very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"She possibly had orthodontics when she was younger, plus she’s had them whitened. She is blessed with a beautiful smile. </p>\n<p>\n\"Billie and Sam Faiers both have great teeth too. The majority of the TOWIE crew have polar white teeth from whitening services and it is often accentuated by their dark tans. </p>\n<p>\n“Before you proceed with any dental cosmetic procedures you need to ensure your teeth and gums are in optimum condition. </p>\n<p>\n“We always advise patients to come for a free dental consultation and then a hygienist appointment, where their teeth will be cleaned, scaled and polished. You should try to have these every three months to keep your teeth and gums healthy. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“If you don’t have healthy teeth, any procedures you have will never last. If you have, say, veneers, instead of lasting from 15 to 20 years they will only last for five if you have a receding gum line. </p>\n<p>\n“Our most popular treatment for the TOWIE look is whitening. We advise our younger patients to have the at-home whitening service. </p>\n<p>\n“This isn’t as strong as the in-house service, laser whitening. </p>\n<p>\nIt costs around £390 for the take-home kit. This comprises syringes of peroxide bleach that are injected into a special mould, like a gum shield, that fits over the teeth. The patient wears this for one or two hours a day. It is a popular quick-fix treatment. </p>\n<p>\n“Whitening should only ever be provided by a qualified dental practitioner. Don’t be fooled by ultra-cheap services as they could be practising illegally and not providing an effective or safe product. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“If young clients come to us asking for veneers, we tend to put them off because of their age. We don’t want to compromise the health of their teeth – you can get straight and even teeth without going down the veneer route. </p>\n<p>\n“We advise them to have other treatments such as braces. There are so many that are inconspicuous these days, where they are clear in appearance or hidden behind the back of your teeth. </p>\n<p>\n“Another simple but effective service is where we use composite (poly-resin) to build up teeth so they are all the same level. However, they must be maintained, as they can discolour or chip over time. </p>\n<p>\n“Other popular teeth treatments for the TOWIE look include the Inman Aligner. </p>\n<p>\n“This is a unique way of straightening crooked teeth with a removable brace that fits behind the teeth. It takes an average of six to 16 weeks to achieve excellent results. </p>\n<p>\n“You can pop it out whenever you need to, so it’s perfect if you have a hot date. Holly Willoughby recently tweeted pictures of her aligner brace in a bid to improve her smile. </p>\n<p>\n“The Inman Aligner is a cheaper alternative to get crooked teeth into shape quickly and easily. The only downside is it may affect your speech slightly for a few days, plus it can be sore or uncomfortable, but it will settle. </p>\n<p>\n“This teeth-straightening service would cost around £1,400 and has fantastic results.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/beauty/4244754/Latest-lash-lengthening-products.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Luscious lashes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4235133/Darkest-fake-tan-in-stores.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Darkest fake tan in stores"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/beauty/4235279/As-nature-intended-Stars-who-face-the-world-without-slap.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Stars face the world just as nature intended"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/beauty/4231988/Look-the-bees-knees.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Look the bee’s knees"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4226252/Stars-looking-better-with-age.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Stars looking better with age"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/towie2_1486936a.jpg","caption":"Smiles better ... sisters Billie and Sam Faiers"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/towiesmile_1486935a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01487/GenevieveKeane_1487178a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Thigh-catching ... the tiniest mini-skirts are worn by 23-year-old women","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNN0925A_main_1486699a.jpg","section":"woman","headline":"Women aged 23 show off the most leg","teaser":"SKIRT lengths vary by 20ins as women go through life — but at age 23 it’s a miniskirt","byline":"By JANE HAMILTON, Consumer Writer","timestamp":"Mon, 09 Apr 2012 00:58:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nSKIRT lengths vary by 20ins as women go through life — and 23-year-olds wear the tiniest minis, a study found. </p>\n<p>\nConfident women now wear mini-skirts until they hit 45, five years later than when the study was last carried out in 2009. </p>\n<p>\nGirls first want a mini aged 14, but most settle for rolling up their 46cm (18in) school skirts until they buy one at 16. </p>\n<p>\nThey wear skirts averaging 36cms (14ins) until they’re 19.

From teenage lads to pensioners, Maureen has satisfied them all. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I’m such an actress, I even add sound effects to make their experience realistic. My favourite is flicking the elastic on my manky pop-socks. </p>\n<p>\n“The snapping noise against my skin emulates the sound of the sexy fishnet stockings that I promise the men I am wearing. Of course, the reality is that I’m taking the bins out.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause there are no visuals with a phone call, it is important that Maureen describes herself with detail too. </p>\n<p>\n<i>She says: “I tell the men I’m tall and slim with jet-black hair down to my waist and I’m almost always holding a whip. In reality, I’m short with curly red hair and often carrying the iron.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMaureen’s punters love to feel as if she is really in the room with them, so she has found some odd ways to make her sex noises as lifelike as possible. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I find that if I put my knees up to my neck, it compresses my diaphragm, then my groans sound pitch-perfect. I also watch When Harry Met Sally as homework. Meg Ryan was my sex noise idol. It really is quite amazing how gullible men are.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBeing a sex line worker wasn’t always the plan for Newcastle housewife Maureen. She says: “A few years ago I saw an advert in the local paper, saying ‘Tarot readers required’. </p>\n<p>\n“It was a subject I’d always been interested in and I enjoyed doing readings for friends and family. </p>\n<p>\n“When I called to enquire, I was told they were full on the tarot-reading line but had space on the sex line.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter some doubts Maureen decided to give it a go. She says: “I had nothing to lose and what they were offering seemed perfect. I could do it from the comfort of my sofa and pick my hours. </p>\n<p>\n“I simply had to log on to the chatline system using my home phone with a PIN number they gave me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMaureen created her alter ego Scarlett and says: “I remember thinking that the name Maureen just isn’t sexy enough. I didn’t want to sound middle-aged. That’s why Scarlett was born. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Whenever the phone rings, I morph into her. Scarlett has worked as an air hostess and a make-up artist — and when it comes to the bedroom, she’s up for anything.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMaureen’s aim is to keep callers on the phone for as long as possible because the longer the call lasts, the more she gets paid. She says: “I can earn up to £15 an hour. On a good day during peak time, I can earn 35 quid for a couple of hours on the phone.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFortunately, Maureen’s boyfriend Paul, a 50-year-old engineer, doesn’t have a problem with her unusual job. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I never work when he is in the house, out of respect. But he is as open-minded as me and knows I earn well out of it. </p>\n<p>\n“Sometimes he would roll his eyes but he was fine with me doing it — as long as I didn’t tell him what the callers were saying to me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a year in the job, Maureen stepped it up a gear and started working on the dominatrix lines too. This time her alter ego was Katia, a 6ft blonde Norwegian prison guard. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I would threaten in my best Scandinavian accent, ‘My bite is as bad as my bark.’ The men loved the idea of Katia and I felt pretty sexy pretending to be her. I even had some punters call from Hong Kong.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: “My friends all think I’m bonkers, especially my friend Maggie, who didn’t know how to react when I told her about my secret job. </p>\n<p>\n“Thankfully, they don’t judge me and instead we laugh about it. I’m a bubbly character and they know I mean no harm by what I do.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter doing the job for only a short while, Maureen realised she had quite a talent for acting and role play and decided to take a course in drama alongside her phone work. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I got a place at university in September 2010. I’ve always loved the idea of acting and I dream about playing a character like Lillian in Shameless. </p>\n<p>\n“The course is in performing arts and drama — the perfect combination. I even did a rendition of Katia in my class once. </p>\n<p>\n“I’ve decided to be open about my job — I’ve got nothing to hide. In fact I’m thrilled — my secret job has opened up a whole new life for me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nNow in the final year of her course, Maureen is too busy for the chat lines and says: “It’s so funny how one thing can lead you on to something new. Although my course comes first, I would certainly go back to the sex lines in the future if I needed to financially. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I know Scarlett and Katia will always be waiting in the wings, but for now I keep the saucy talk for my bedroom only.”</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/parenting/4243664/Teen-diary-that-will-shock-every-parent.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Teen diary that will shock every parent"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/4223499/Tulisas-sex-tape-brought-back-bad-memories-for-mum.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Ex posted a sex tape like Tulisa’s on the internet... years later my boyfriend saw it and dumped me"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4233505/Megan-Fox-on-being-a-sex-symbol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"There is no secret to being a sex symbol.

I was deprived of my basic human rights. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m genuinely shocked and horrified to hear that another little girl has had to go through this. My heart goes out to that child and anyone who is forced to marry. </p>\n<p>\n“That is why I am sharing my experience, to reach out to those girls and young women. There is hope and light at the end of the tunnel.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe went on: “I know that such behaviour is contrary to the teachings of Islam and must be therefore outlawed. </p>\n<p>\n“There is no Islamic justification for forced marriage and doing it to a child of that age is not just wrong — it is criminal.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSamina, now in her early 40s, rebuilt her life to become a successful business entrepreneur. </p>\n<p>\nBut she is still haunted by memories of beatings, brutality and repression. </p>\n<p>\nRecalling her childhood wedding day, she said: “There was a lot of activity — a lot of relatives in the house. I was dressed up in an outfit mother-in-law had bought for me. </p>\n<p>\n“My sister told me later that my mother-in-law had said, ‘At last, the beautiful girl belongs to me!’\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know exactly why I was married off at such a young age, but it was all to do with maintaining traditions and making sure we didn’t question anything.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSamina was born into a typical Asian family in a close-knit community, keeping to the ways of their remote villages of northern Pakistan. </p>\n<p>\nShe was not encouraged in school work and was removed at 13. </p>\n<p>\nInstead she was raised to believe a woman’s place was at home and the more she suffered, the greater the reward in Paradise. </p>\n<p>\nOn her 14th birthday a formal wedding ceremony was held, marking the bride’s transition from her parents’ home to the home of the husband. </p>\n<p>\nAt six the next morning, terrified for her future, she was bundled on to a plane to Pakistan. </p>\n<p>\nShe was told she would return to England with her husband when she reached 16. </p>\n<p>\nShe used to dread evenings when she would have to tearfully face the advances of her husband. </p>\n<p>\nThe marriage was eventually consummated against her will after she suffered a horrific beating. </p>\n<p>\nAfter three months it was decided she should live under lock and key back in England until she turned 16. </p>\n<p>\nForced marriage in Britain comes under civil, not criminal, law. Many victims are sent abroad. </p>\n<p>\nThose at risk can apply for a court order stopping them — or the marriage organisers — from leaving the country. Anyone breaking such an order can be jailed for up to two years for contempt of court. </p>\n<p>\nVictims who do return to the UK find the marriage is not legally recognised — but whoever forced them into marrying cannot be prosecuted. </p>\n<p>\nThe Government is currently looking at changing the law. </p>\n<p>\nSamina, who backs a change, remembers how she was not even allowed out into the garden. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I missed the sunlight on my face. I used to look out at kids playing and feel an overwhelming sense of envy.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 20 Samina gave birth to a daughter. She said: “At that point I knew that there was no way that she would endure what I had been through.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe became obsessed with cleanliness. Samina explained: “I felt like I’d been bottling up everything. I was scrubbing the house and then scrubbing myself, cleansing myself. I was trying to rub away stains of abuse. </p>\n<p>\n“I’d been locked up and I locked my feelings up too. </p>\n<p>\n“My husband insisted that I never reveal I had been married at such a young age. I had to say I was married at 16. </p>\n<p>\n“But as my daughter went to school I got interested in studying again.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Against her husband’s wishes she took GCSEs at college. After ten years she beat her obsessive compulsive disorder. And, at the age of 37, she left her husband.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: “It had got to the point where I wasn’t allowed to smile because smiling was said to be the sign of a loose woman, a woman who was flirting.” </p>\n<p>\nLeaving was an incredibly brave move considering how it was deemed unacceptable for a Muslim woman to ask for a divorce. </p>\n<p>\nSamina went back to her parents but ended up trudging the streets. </p>\n<p>\nFor the first time in the interview, Samina breaks down and sobs: “I was so upset, I thought everyone had abandoned me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nContemplating suicide, she started writing a text of apology to her daughter. She said: “Then I thought, how could I? She needed me — I couldn’t leave her.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSamina found herself outside a church where she knew the priest. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I was so disheartened I wanted to abandon everything I had been taught in childhood. </p>\n<p>\n“I thought the best thing I could do was to convert. Maybe being a Christian would give me peace.” </p>\n<p>\nBut the priest told her Islam had not let her down — people had. </p>\n<p>\nHe contacted a Muslim woman who gave Samina a bed for the night and a shoulder to cry on. </p>\n<p>\nEventually — with the help of friends, her daughter and one other relative — she got back on her feet and even made up with her family. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I stopped seeing myself through other people’s eyes. I finally realised I was not an inferior being. Deep down, I always had a belief that I would free myself.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSamina now gives talks to women’s groups and is a mentor to youngsters. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “Islam safeguards women’s rights, and I am delighted that I found the Islam that God sent down — not the one that has been hijacked by the jackals who misrepresent its true teachings.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nGirls’ lives must be theirs to live </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By JASVINDER SANGHERA</b>,<b> Head of forced marriage charity Karma Nirvana</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nPEOPLE will be horrified that a five-year-old girl in Britain could enter into a marriage. Sadly, I am not at all surprised. </p>\n<p>\nAlongside many others, her life was mapped out before her. Her life was not her own to live but for others to take. </p>\n<p>\nToday there remain thousands at risk. Last week we delivered more than 2,500 postcards to Number 10.

Martine will proudly wear the number 7 on her Team GB vest this summer — in memory of the fateful day that led to 52 deaths at the hands of al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “Some people might only see the negative in what happened to me. But I’m turning it into a positive.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor Martine, London 2012 and the 7/7 horrors will always be tied together. </p>\n<p>\nA day before the attacks, the International Olympic Committee announced London had won the bid to host the Games. </p>\n<p>\nMartine, a marketing manager at the time, decided to have a few drinks with colleagues after work to celebrate. </p>\n<p>\nIt led to her spending an extra ten fateful minutes in bed next morning. </p>\n<p>\nShe missed her normal train, then a Northern Line signal failure meant she took the Circle Line to work. </p>\n<p>\nShe ended up sitting just 4ft from Tanweer when he set off his bomb. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Martine recalled: “There was a white flash. It felt like being in a Tom and Jerry cartoon and being hit in the face with a frying pan.</i> </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s how it vibrated. Then the light went and all I could see was darkness. </p>\n<p>\n“All you could smell was burning, and all you could hear were screams. </p>\n<p>\n“I could see my brand new white trainer 8ft above all the debris. </p>\n<p>\n“And I remember thinking ‘what’s it doing up there?’”\n</p>\n<p>\nMartine lost three quarters of her blood before she was rescued. </p>\n<p>\nShe was in an induced coma for two weeks. Her body was so swollen that her brother and sister at first failed to identify her in hospital. </p>\n<p>\nDuring that time Martine had 12 operations to amputate her legs above the knee. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I thought my life was over when I woke up and saw that my legs were gone. But when I found out how many people had died, I realised I was one of the lucky ones — and I needed to grab every opportunity.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMartine, who now uses prosthetic legs as well as a wheelchair, married long-term boyfriend Nick, 39, and gave birth to Oscar, now 2½, soon after. </p>\n<p>\nBut she decided she wanted a new challenge and joined a sitting volleyball team after falling in love with the sport at a Paralympics taster day. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Martine said: “This is a whole new dream. It gives me the drive and ambition I used to feel at work.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nSitting volleyball is played across a lower net than the regular game. </p>\n<p>\nPlayers’ backsides must not lose contact with the floor when they hit the ball. Britain has not had an Olympic sitting volleyball team before. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBy a strange coincidence, the British sitting volleyball team’s first international match was on July 7, 2010. Around this time, the team were regularly thrashed. But Martine says they are now ready to take on the best in the world this summer. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “It felt like we had a mountain to climb at first. </p>\n<p>\n“But we have started to get sets off teams that used to walk all over us. </p>\n<p>\n“We might not be the most experienced team, but we can make sure we are the fittest and the strongest. With home advantage, anything can happen.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Martine’s journey has not been an easy one. She explained: “In the first days after I woke up in the hospital, it was so hard looking down at where my legs used to be and thinking, ‘My God, there’s nothing there’. </p>\n<p>\n“I could barely look at myself in the mirror. It was only when I went up to the physio gym at the hospital and met other survivors I realised how many had died, and that I was one of the lucky ones. I’m still here. I’m still me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMartine threw herself into rehab but found the going tough. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “Half your body is gone so it’s a whole balance thing. </p>\n<p>\n“Your body can’t compute that all that weight is gone. So even to sit up in bed feels impossible. </p>\n<p>\n“Learning to walk again with prosthetic legs was the hardest thing I ever had to do, physically and mentally. </p>\n<p>\n“Having to deal with it every second of every day is overwhelming. </p>\n<p>\n“But I was lucky enough to have brilliant medical and physio staff that made me strong again.” Martine went on to get her air pilot’s licence and even did a sky dive for charity. But sport is her real passion. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “No one should underestimate what sport can give people. At university I played mainly hockey but at school it was all sorts.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Surprisingly, Martine feels no bitterness about her fate. She said: “I have never been angry towards the bomber. I just thought what he did was a bloody selfish thing to do. But he was brainwashed. I know other survivors who still have nightmares, but I don’t.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nInstead, the sports star dreams of gold medals. She said: “It’s the biggest sporting event on Earth, and it’s coming to the city where I was born. What Londoner doesn’t dream of being part of it?”\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\ne.fairbairn@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4247374/Olympic-fury-as-84-brof-gifts-made-abroad.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Olympic fury as 84% of gifts made abroad"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3187479/77-survivor-is-praised-by-judge.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"7/7 survivor is praised by judge"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3973649/GBs-Olympic-class-of-2012.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"GB’s Olympic class of 2012"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3723755/Paralympics-will-shift-perceptions.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Olympics must not overshadow Paralympics"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2195278/London-bomb-Tube-hell-Martine-Wrights-77-baby.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tube-hell Martine's 7/7 baby"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNN0829A-532_1486014a.jpg","caption":"Contender ...

Getting older is where it’s at. The self-knowledge, wisdom and experience, the richness to your life that you gain with age. I would not trade it for the world. </p>\n<p>\n“People say young is beautiful. I don’t think so. There is such a beauty in a mature person. Something else shines through. </p>\n<p>\n“I can’t wait to have really long grey hair like an old lady. I genuinely can’t. It is about not having to care about how I look. </p>\n<p>\n“If I wasn’t on TV I would dread to think what I would look like. I don’t make much effort with myself. The only effort I do make is when I know I have got to appear in people’s living rooms.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“I don’t like wearing make-up and when I’m at home I don’t care what I look like.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMelinda first came to prominence as The Sun’s Page 3 “girl of the thrillennium” at the turn of the century — but says her glamour modelling days now feel like a lifetime ago. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “It was a really brief amount of time but it has had some of the biggest impact. </p>\n<p>\n“I feel a lot more comfortable and relaxed doing photoshoots now, it is a lot more fun. Back then it was kind of scary and intimidating. Now it is a nice bit of light relief.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe added: “I have fond memories of that time, although I was very naïve — even though I was 27 years old at the time. </p>\n<p>\n“It feels like another age. It is so different to my life now but I wouldn’t change it for the world — but I also wouldn’t do it again.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMelinda — mum to Morgan, 12, Flynn, ten, and Evie, eight, — says she would support her daughter if she decided that she wanted to go into modelling. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I wanted to do glamour modelling and nobody was going to stop me at that time. If Evie really feels that is what she wants, I am behind her 100 per cent. </p>\n<p>\n“I don’t measure success by status or money or job titles. I measure success by how fulfilled you are. That’s what success is. </p>\n<p>\n“If my kids can find what they love and do it I will be the happiest mum on earth. That is all I want for all three.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMelinda says she is most comfortable when at home with her kids and hubby Wayne Roberts, who she married in Bali in 1998. </p>\n<p>\nShe has previously spoken of the tough time the couple went through in 2008, when they split for eight months after Melinda said they had lost their “deep connection”. </p>\n<p>\nBut Melinda said things were now good at home — although they still have to work at keeping their relationship strong. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “Me and Wayne are still together. We have still been working through a lot of stuff but it is good now. I am still constantly gobsmacked we are still together after what we have been through. </p>\n<p>\n“It is amazing. It is something I really value but a relationship needs constant work. </p>\n<p>\n“Our family is so important to us. That is what glues us together in the tough times and makes us want to work through our problems. </p>\n<p>\n“We all have times when it is amazing and times when we are like, ‘Why are we together?’ and we probably always will to some degree. Of course it would be amazing to say we will be together for ever but we are constantly growing and changing. </p>\n<p>\n“Who knows where we will be in the future but I like to think we will be together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMelinda said she is honest about her family life in the hope that it will help others who have also had tough times. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “One of the things I used to struggle with was when people would portray us as having the perfect relationship. </p>\n<p>\n“It is unfair and sets an unfair ideal for others to measure themselves against. The reality is there is little in life that is perfect — you just do the best you can. </p>\n<p>\n“I don’t like to pretend I’m anything I’m not and there is nothing wrong with me being me, flaws and all. </p>\n<p>\n“I hope it does help other people to think, ‘Thank God, we are not the only ones.’\n</p>\n<p>\n“I hope it would give hope to other people in a relationship. We have been together for 16 years now. We can weather the storm and come out the other side. “People sometimes think when you are a celebrity you have this kind of immunity but fame and money doesn’t buy you that. If anything it can make things harder.” </p>\n<p>\nMelinda admitted that being a working mum was also tough at times. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “The children are growing up really quickly. It can be a struggle to get the balance right. </p>\n<p>\n“The work I do is massively demanding as it means I have to travel and be away from home so it means I have got to be strict about my priorities and what I take on. </p>\n<p>\n“At half-term we went down to St Ives and I turned down three jobs that were really amazing and well-paid but the time with my kids was more important. </p>\n<p>\n“It is hard when I have to leave in the morning and they don’t want me to leave. That pulls on my heart strings. Being a working mum you feel pulled in all directions.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMelinda is back on the box tonight in new Channel 5 series Cowboy Traders, which sees her investigate dodgy dealings — something she found upsetting. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “The new series has been amazing. After doing Cowboy Builders, I thought there couldn’t be anything else that gets me in quite the same way but this programme is something else again. </p>\n<p>\n“We are looking at all different areas. There was one story where an elderly couple bought a mobile home and put their life savings into it and moved to France waiting for it to arrive... but it never did. They had been conned. </p>\n<p>\n“That is their future over. They fought through the war for this to happen. It was heartbreaking stuff. </p>\n<p>\n“I try to leave work at work but sometimes I lie in bed at night thinking about it. </p>\n<p>\n“I do find it hard. It is really tough emotionally. My consolation is that we try and do what we can for the people on the show.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cowboy Traders is on at 7pm.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3002830/Theres-a-nip-in-the-air-for-Melinda-Messenger.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Busty Mel pops out of frock"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2979651/Melinda-Messengers-not-made-up-with-Jordans-plans.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Mel's not made up with Jordan"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2885977/Ian-Wright-Melinda-Messenger-wasnt-right-for-show.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Melinda wasn’t Wright"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2829772/Melinda-Messenger-is-leaving-Channel-Fives-Live-From-Studio-Five-show.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Melinda’s Live chat goodbye"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01486/SNF09MEL1---532_1486756a.jpg","caption":"Positive message ...

He likes to be number one in everything he does. He has told producers they must make BGT even better. </p>\n<p>\n“He is known as being a perfectionist and this will will only renew his desire to beat The Voice.”\n</p>\n<p>\nTo add insult to injury, Cowell’s former X Factor judging pal Cheryl Cole praised The Voice, which features her pal Will.I.Am. </p>\n<p>\nIgnoring BGT, Cheryl tweeted: “He is soo cheeky and mischievous! I love his and Jessie’s banter.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCowell fears the success of The Voice could damage his X Factor cash-cow and has demanded that BGT wrenches back the Saturday night ratings crown from the BBC. </p>\n<p>\nHe will take some comfort from BGT getting a higher peak figure, 11.3million to The Voice’s 10.7million. But the source said: “The big fear is that viewers will start seeing The Voice as the leading singing show. </p>\n<p>\n“That would mean the best singers flocking to apply to it instead of The X Factor — and these shows live or die on their talent. </p>\n<p>\n“Simon always learns lessons. He will be seriously considering whether he has to be nicer to contestants. </p>\n<p>\n“He has softened his Mr Nasty image over the years. But maybe now he needs to turn fully into Mr Nice. It’s clear viewers are starting to get a taste for more positive shows.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBGT bosses believe <b>HUMOUR</b> will be their trump card — especially now David Walliams is a judge. Viewers love the bickering between the Little Britain comic and Cowell. </p>\n<p>\nA source said: “One of the criticisms of The Voice is that there isn’t enough humour in it. BGT has it in spades. You’ll definitely see more of David’s silly run-ins with Cowell.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA pal of Cowell defended BGT last night, saying: “It’s feel-good, a warm family show. It doesn’t take itself too seriously or milk sob stories.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe battle between the shows has in fact pushed ratings up for both. </p>\n<p>\nMagnanimous Cowell tweeted well done to BBC1 boss Danny Cohen. </p>\n<p>\nHe wrote: “A slightly irritated congrats. But you didn’t have a dancing dog!” He went on: “I thought our team made a fantastic show last night. Loving the show this year.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHis spokesman added: “Simon is happy with the ratings. The judges are looking forward to the live shows.”\n</p>\n<h1>\nIs that Alesha?

I saw the replay and it was a penalty. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“We didn’t pose enough threat after that. If you manage to get a second goal, it gives the opposition less hope. But, at 1-0, it’s always shaky.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe draw leaves Chelsea in sixth place in the Premier League, although they move a point closer to Spurs. </p>\n<p>\nDi Matteo said: “We have been playing catch-up all season, so the situation for fourth was difficult for us from the start. </p>\n<p>\n\"But we have to look at it positively. We’re a point closer to fourth spot and we are closer to Champions League qualification than we were a month ago. </p>\n<p>\n“It is going to go right down to the last game. Arsenal have got a bit of a gap now, so it’s looking like it will be three teams going for fourth place.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFulham boss Martin Jol said: “It was a soft penalty and it was all a bit confusing. We thought it was Danny but he touched the ball. </p>\n<p>\n“The ref said Kelly but that was an accidental collision. I thought Kalou tripped himself. </p>\n<p>\n“But we deserved the point. They didn’t cause us many problems.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe former Tottenham manager added: “I think Spurs will finish fourth, they have all the quality.

Three points and a 1-0 win would have put a revived Chelsea into fifth place, behind Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final opponents by just one goal. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNow they must rely on Tottenham slipping up again with so few games left — and Chelsea have the much harder run-in. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA costly lapse in concentration at the back only puts more pressure on, with so many other key games looming. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJust three days after Sunday’s Wembley showdown with Spurs, comes Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAfter this draw, winning the big one looks like being the only way they will be back in Europe again next season. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nChelsea were eventually lucky to get out of their neighbours’ house with a point, such was the pummelling they took in the final stages of a match which slowly got into gear after Lampard tucked away his spot-kick. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt had been all Fulham until then too, as Martin Jol’s eye-catching side tested Petr Cech. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAn interchange between Moussa Dembele and Dempsey in the 26th minute eventually led to a shot from the in-form American. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut it was too slow and Chelsea’s keeper covered the danger comfortably. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJust 60 seconds later, Kerim Frei exploded into the area. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe young midfielder wriggled past John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill with a neat twist then let rip with a low shot, which was heading goalwards until Cech launched himself and tipped the ball round his near post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith bodies firmly behind the ball and Fulham’s full-backs throwing themselves in the path of everything, Chelsea were reduced to a few lame, long-range efforts. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFernando Torres had an effort deflected over the bar, Salomon Kalou shot straight at Mark Schwarzer from 25 yards and Lampard fired off a wayward shot on 31 minutes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat almost cleared the Hammersmith End of the Cottage. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen fate, or the referee stepped in, just as the officials played a big part in Saturday’s hugely fortunate 2-1 win over Wigan which kept the Di Matteo bandwagon rolling along. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn 45 minutes, ref Mark Clattenburg gave a penalty to Chelsea which left Fulham raging even as everyone trooped off at half-time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nKalou darted into the box only to be met by Danny Murphy. The Fulham skipper got the ball but also showed studs to the Chelsea forward who tumbled over. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLampard was more precise this time with his finishing, neatly placing a shot low and to the right of Schwarzer to claim his 150th Prem goal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMurphy hounded Clattenburg at half-time — arguing the case that if he had shown studs, why had he not been booked. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was a justifiable argument and later it was suggested the penalty was given for right-back Stephen Kelly’s foul on Kalou a split second earlier. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhatever it was for, it was hard cheese on Fulham who had led the way in open play. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nChelsea appeared to have their minds on their forthcoming semi-finals — when the chase for fourth place should also be a priority. They emerged far more energetic in the second half. Lampard went close with a left-foot curler and had a shout for a second penalty when shoved by Brede Hangeland. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFulham rose to the increased tempo, too. In particular, teenager Frei teased Chelsea, drawing a series of fouls. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe pressure mounted and, eventually, Fulham got their reward. Cech made a stunning save at a corner from Aaron Hughes’ header. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut 30 seconds later a second set-piece came in and Dempsey rose unchallenged to flick home his third goal in two games to knock the stuffing out of Chelsea. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN - KERIM FREI </b>(Fulham) </p>\n<p>\n<b>FULHAM: </b>Schwarzer 6, Kelly 6, Hangeland 7, Hughes 7, JA Riise 7, Duff 6, Murphy 6 (Etuhu 5), Diarra 7 (Orlando Sa 6), Frei 8 (Kacaniklic 5), Dembele 6, Dempsey 7.

While Spurs wait for the inevitable they are blowing up in spectacular style. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact, they could miss out on European football completely if they carry on the way they are, having won only one of their last eight Premier League games. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut this tale should not only be about Tottenham’s failure. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis was one of the most outstanding performances seen at White Hart Lane since Redknapp took over — and it came from a Norwich team which bossed the show. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nElliott Bennett’s cracking 66th-minute strike sealed a deserved victory for the East Anglians. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPaul Lambert’s men never stopped harassing Spurs from first whistle to last and would not allow their opponents to indulge in any of the champagne football which has become their trademark. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRedknapp admitted City striker Grant Holt, 30 — who is also being tipped for an England job — bullied his defence. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat will not do Holt’s chances of going to the Euros any harm if Harry takes over. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nInterestingly, every one of the players in Canaries’ starting line-up was English born. Only Russell Martin, who has been capped by Scotland, does not qualify to pull on a Three Lions jersey. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLambert described the Norwich display as the best in his three years at the club where he first assumed control when they were in League One. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe took over after City had been beaten 7-1 by the side he then managed, Colchester. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFrom such humble beginnings to winning at Spurs and doing it in such style speaks volumes for Lambert’s influence. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLambert, Newcastle’s Alan Pardew and Swansea chief Brendan Rodgers, are all candidates for Manager of the Year. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey have given the Premier League an extra dimension with their refreshing approach. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFrankly, Spurs were flat as your hat and they will have to raise their game considerably before they face Chelsea in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey were behind on 13 minutes when Younes Kaboul lost out to Anthony Pilkington and, although Kyle Walker tried to clear, the ball rebounded back off Ledley King. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt fell straight back to Pilkington, who converted comfortably. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nGareth Bale’s rasping cross almost brought Spurs an equaliser but Jermain Defoe just failed to connect as he slid in. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen came a big moment of controversy as Holt muscled his way into the box and was clearly dragged down by King. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nReferee Michael Oliver was unmoved by Norwich appeals and City lost their concentration, giving the ball away and letting Spurs get back on level terms. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPilkington allowed Walker to take the ball off his toe and Jake Livermore stepped in to release Defoe with a delightful pass. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nDefoe’s finish was quality as he dinked the ball over keeper John Ruddy and just inside the post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLambert slammed his water bottle into the ground and it must have bounced 30 yards down the touchline. Fourth official Phil Dowd was also left in no doubt of the visiting boss’ views about the incompetence of his colleague Mr Oliver. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFor all that, Norwich did not let their heads drop. If anything it made them more determined. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey did well to keep Spurs at bay, first when Martin threw himself at Bale’s shot and then as Ruddy saved brilliantly to deny Benoit Assou-Ekotto following a lovely one-two with half-time sub Emmanuel Adebayor — on for the ineffective Louis Saha. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nKeeper Ruddy, 25, is another who Redknapp might have noted with a view to the Euros. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNorwich had more justified appeals for a penalty as Adebayor seemed to flatten Aaron Wilbraham just inside the box, but referee Oliver again let play carry on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHad Bale scored when he cut inside and rattled a shot against the underside of the bar, who knows what Lambert would have done to fourth official Dowd. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNo matter how aggrieved Lambert felt, he need not have worried because Bennett, 23, then produced that wonder strike — his first goal for the club - to settle the match. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe midfelder collected the ball by the right touchline and let rip a 20-yard strike into the far corner which gave Brad Friedel no chance. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“We are staying up,” sang the travelling supporters. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey do themselves a dis-service.

A sweet Johan Cryuff turn started it off as he sensationally skipped and danced past four Bolton challenges. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe ball seemed magnetically stuck to his feet. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe went this way and that, before sweetly dinking it past on-rushing defender David Wheater and beyond keeper Adam Bogdan. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was a brilliant, wonderful goal that Leo Messi would have been proud of. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPerhaps, it was not as sensational as the Diego Maradona- like effort he scored at the start of the year against Blackburn in the FA Cup. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat was also a beauty. But make no mistake this was right behind it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBen Arfa has proved the most frustrating of players at times. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYet, something seems to have finally clicked in his head. The goods are being produced on a far more regular basis by a guy who is clearly blessed with bucketloads of world class ability. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoss Pardew should also take a bow for the way he has handled a player who has not been the easiest to manage. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt must be remembered what a massive win this was for Newcastle’s Euro push, leaving them right in the mix for a Champions League place. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBen Arfa’s goal settled frayed nerves before Papiss Cisse kept up his remarkable scoring run to seal the deal late on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith Toon flying so high there is an expectation of them ploughing through teams. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPardew’s men have not lost at home since December but the problem was, Bolton turned up on Tyneside organised, compact and ready to compete. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Trotters knew a performance on par with the pitiful home defeat to Fulham at the weekend could not be repeated. And their gameplan worked a treat until Ben Arfa struck. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe first half was, for want of a better word, awful. Chances were at a premium. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOwen Coyle’s strugglers were having their moments. Martin Petrov wriggled into the box just after the half-hour but his low shot was straight at keeper Tim Krul. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nToon’s Fabricio Coloccini, back after two games out with a hamstring strain, curled a shot straight at Bogdan. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYet, as the first half ticked towards the end, we were still waiting for a decent opening from either side. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith Coyle packing the midfield and using striker Kevin Davies as his lone battering ram, it was always going to be this way. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe challenge for Toon was to, somehow, unlock the door. Two minutes after the re-start, though, they should have been behind. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nChris Eagles evaded Coloccini’s tackle only to be denied by Krul’s legs from eight yards. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was the best chance of the game. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAt this point, the visitors looked most likely to break the deadlock. And Petrov sent a cross flashing dangerously across the box soon after. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnother chance went begging for Bolton when Mark Davies was free in the box but fluffed his lines. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNewcastle hauled off Ba for Shola Ameobi on 64 minutes. He was not happy about it as he brushed off Pardew’s attempted handshake. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Senegalese, who has now gone nine games without a goal, is not enjoying seeing his star stolen by international team-mate Cisse. But French schemer Ben Arfa could soon eclipse both of them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nToon were struggling to carve open Bolton and it needed something special. Well, boy oh boy, did Ben Arfa deliver with just 17 minutes left. His balance, poise and control were a joy to behold. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPardew’s crazed celebration said it all and when Cisse, looking suspiciously offside, bagged his 10th goal in his last nine games from Ameobi’s cross, the match was over. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNewcastle march on. Their Champions League dream is alive thanks to a fifth win on the bounce. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut this is a game which will always be remembered for one of the great Premier League goals. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMagnifique. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN - HATEM BEN ARFA </b>(Newcastle) </p>\n<p>\n<b>NEWCASTLE:</b> Krul 7, Simpson 6, Williamson 7, Coloccini 8, Santon 7, Ben Arfa 8 (R Taylor 5), Cabaye 6, Perch 6 (Ferguson 5), Gutierrez 6, Ba 6 (Shola Ameobi 5), Cisse 7.

His energy, effort and link-up play were first class and we were really pleased. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“He is a great character, trains well and certainly has the ability.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nGueye struck seven minutes after the break to set up Moyes for his first league win over O’Neill at the 10th attempt. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAs James McFadden’s corner was not properly cleared, South African Pienaar headed it square for fellow midfielder Leon Osman to strike. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd when his thunderbolt came back off Black Cats keeper Simon Mignolet, Gueye was in like a shot to drill the rebound home at the near post for his first Everton goal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSunderland, frankly, were a huge disappointment and from that minute on it only ever looked a case of how many for Everton, with McFadden, Marouane Fellaini and Denis Stracqualursi all going close. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNot that they were ever going to pay for blowing those openings, with the Black Cats’ one and only chance — and no more than a half chance at that — coming when a Kieran Richardson cross caused a brief moment of panic. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut any home nerves were swiftly calmed with two goals in 60 seconds — and both a carbon copy of each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFirst, the hugely impressive Pienaar took a Gueye pass and curled the neatest of side-footed efforts in off Mignolet’s far post to make it 2-0. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd then, as Gueye looped another pass to Osman, we got an even more clinical finish off the woodwork. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJust to rub salt into the wounds, Victor Anichebe made it four after stepping off the bench. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis volley struck Jack Colback on the chest to leave Mignolet with no chance — and O’Neill ruing a bad day at the office. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Sunderland boss admitted: “Everton were stronger and deserved to win. We looked a little tired and have lots to learn — we have lots of work to do.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe visitors were forced to makes changes before and during the game after Saturday’s battling home draw against Tottenham and O’Neill added: “We were missing Nicklas Bendtner but should have been able to get on with that. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“We have had to make changes a lot this year, with players playing out of position — but that’s no excuse because we were well beaten. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“A few seniors players, like Lee Cattermole and Phil Bardsley, were carrying injuries going into the game and early in the second half you could see they were struggling. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“But they’ve got good hearts and wanted to play. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“Sometimes the scoreline can be misleading but we’ve been beaten 4-0 and deservedly so.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt means Everton go to Wembley on the back of just two defeats in 16, while rivals Liverpool lurch from one disaster to another. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nEven so, Round tried a somewhat cumbersome attempt at kidology — which was fooling no one — by claiming Kenny Dalglish’s Reds are favourites. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRound claimed: “We have momentum but a derby is a one-off, a semi-final is a one-off and when you put them together there is an element of luck about it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I still think Liverpool are the favourites. They have so many good players and it is such a good club with history and tradition.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHistory and tradition maybe, Steve, but it is hard to remember the last time either of those two hit a winning goal — and Liverpool cannot buy one at the moment. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSomehow, the replica FA Cup being paraded around the corporate boxes before kick-off at Goodison may soon be replaced by the real thing. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN - MAGAYE GUEYE </b>(Everton) </p>\n<p>\n<b>EVERTON: </b>Howard 6, Hibbert 6, Jagielka 7, Heitinga 6, Neville 7 (Coleman 6), Gueye 8, Fellaini 8 (Anichebe 6), Osman 7, Pienaar 7, McFadden 4 (Drenthe 6), Stracqualursi 6.

Look at that tackle on Scott Parker. Look at the challenge on Alex Song.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLook at the way he’s lunged into the tackle on Bacary Sagna, when all he needed to do was shadow him.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere is absolutely nothing about Balotelli that tells me he can win City the title for many, many years — if they kept hold of him.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut I simply don’t know if he has it about him to learn or to change.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOr to want to, for that matter.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd at the moment you just <b>KNOW</b> he will always do something to derail you.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>WHAT damage does someone like that have on everyone else?</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYou only need to look across the city to how they do things at United to see the answer to that.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWayne Rooney’s had his problems at times, but they all came through that because of the manager and how he handled things. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey still sing Eric Cantona’s name on the terraces and, once again, you have to take your hat off to Fergie for such brilliant man-management in getting all he did from the Frenchman.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRooney clearly learned his lesson, maybe United learned a few as well, and look what it’s going to bring them — a 20th league title.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nUnited must be laughing their socks off. No need for Fergie to try any of his mind games this season, because City have done it for him.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>IS Balotelli just being used as a convenient scapegoat?</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI do think there’s some of that, yes. But others have to be in the spotlight too.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCity bought him in the first place, they’ve stuck with him when plenty wouldn’t, so the blame has to be shared. And what none of this should do is mask the fact the team and the manager have both under-achieved, when you look at the money they’ve spent and the dreams they had.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYou can have all the cash in the world but if you haven’t got unity, it won’t count for anything.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd that seems to have been a problem throughout.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nDon’t forget the Carlos Tevez saga — which, in a way, highlights the problem Mario has become, simply through the fact no one is really talking about the Argentinian any more. I think some of the other senior players could play a part as well and try and pull Balotelli into line.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen again, I’m not convinced they could.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>WHAT should City do with him?</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPersonally I’d get rid of him, but I don’t think it’s as simple as that.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt’s OK saying ‘Let’s sell him,’ but who in their right mind would want to spend big, big money on undoubted potential, but proven trouble?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCity are going to have to take a massive hit on the £20million they paid for him. Just like they will on Carlos Tevez and Emmanuel Adebayor as well.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe just always seems so surly, sulky and angry.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe never seems to be enjoying himself, never seems to get pleasure from it, when he’s living the dream.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf City want to shed that noisy neighbours tag, they must leave players like Balotelli behind.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf not, they’ll not win that title for many, many years.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOne bad apple can affect the whole fruit bowl.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd believe me, he will cost them far more than he will ever give.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>SHOULD Mancini stay in charge for next season?</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI would stick with Mancini as manager, certainly for the opening months of next season at least.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf City is, as they constantly tell us, a long-term project, then you need stability in the manager’s office.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf they start building a team around someone like Yaya Toure, who has been a big success, then you never know.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSo at least give Mancini a chance to right the wrongs of this season — and one of the biggest wrongs of all is Balotelli and his attitude.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4247448/Mario-Balotelli-says-sorry-to-Roberto-Mancini.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Balotelli says sorry"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4247191/James-Milner-says-you-cannot-buy-the-Premier-League-title.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Milner’s on the money"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4245884/Arsene-Wenger-hails-Arsenal-as-Mikel-Artetas-goal-beats-Man-City.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Art and craft"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4246033/Roberto-Mancini-warns-Mario-Balotelli-Youll-be-finished-in-two-years.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"You’ll be finished in two years"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4245855/Thumbs-down-for-Citys-Italian-gladiators.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Thumbs down for City's Italian gladiators"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4245994/Mario-Balotelli-to-be-sold-by-Man-City-after-horror-tackle.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Off with his red"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4245684/Arsenal-1-0-Man-City-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Arsenal 1 Manchester City 0"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01487/52_manc_1487039a.jpg","caption":"BLOOPER MARIO ...

He concentrated on the ball, kept his hands at his side and Pennant got in front of him and used his experience to get the foul. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I’m aggrieved at that but they’re a dangerous team and they work it well.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMcLeish must have feared his young side, with seven Academy graduates on show, would eventually buckle at a Stoke set-piece. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThey have now conceded a frightening 21 goals from set-pieces this season and again it proved their undoing. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMcLeish’s misery was compounded by injuries to Stephen Warnock, who will have X-rays on an injured ankle and Chris Herd, who was taken to hospital complaining of feeling sick after taking a knock on the head. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStoke boss Tony Pulis was delighted with his team’s comeback. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe insisted: “We lack lot things but the one thing you can never criticise us for is a lack of effort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“After getting to 41 points against Wolves on Saturday there could have been that feeling of: ‘We’re there, we can just put our sandals on now and wait for our holidays when we can fly out of England.’\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“Sometimes the players — especially from me — don’t get the credit they deserve. We’re not ones for blowing smoke up our own backsides.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPerhaps we should have expected a point apiece as Villa are the undisputed draw kings of the Premier League. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis was their <b>FOURTEENTH</b> draw of the season but the one thing they couldn’t draw was a bumper Bank Holiday crowd as the 30,100 attendance was Villa’s lowest home gate in the league this season. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere was an end of season feel to the proceedings early on as both teams played cat-and-mouse with each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWarnock was booked after eight minutes when he chopped down Ryan Shotton at the second attempt near the right touchline. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut it was 10 more minutes before either team managed a shot on target. Even then, James Collins’ back-post header failed to trouble Asmir Begovic. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAt the other end Jon Walters set up Kenwyne Jones with a cute backheel on the edge of the box but the £8million Trinidadian blasted his shot harmlessly into the side netting. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe game desperately needed a shot in the arm. And kid striker Andi Weimann delivered in style as Villa took the lead after 32 minutes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe home side worked a throw-in on the left to the hitman who turned sharply and played a crisp one-two with Stephen Ireland. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nDespite a packed Potters defence in front of him the 20-year-old curled an exquisite right-foot shot high into the top corner beyond Begovic’s despairing dive. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was the former Rapid Vienna youngster’s second goal in his last five Villa outings, one month on from the dramatic injury-time winner which earned three vital points against Fulham. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe youngster has answered McLeish’s SOS for a goal-scorer to stand in for long-term crock Darren Bent. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAs Stoke wobbled Barry Bannan produced an inviting cutback which Jon Walters sliced dangerously close to his own goal to Begovic’s discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCollins then slashed an angled shot over after Bannan’s corner had been knocked down to him. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStand-in left-back Eric Lichaj earned Villa’s second booking for pulling down Rory Delap as he attempted to break free with Stoke trying to step up the pace. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nKeeper Shay Given then clawed away a wicked Shotton cross at full-stretch. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd Huth should have done better than head wide from six yards after he got on the end of Matthew Etherington’s inswinging corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStoke came even closer to an equaliser just on half-time when Walters’ glancing header scraped just over and landed on the roof of the net. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nVilla almost added to their lead after 57 minutes when Warnock’s flick-on was knocked on by Weimann to Ireland whose first-time pass sent Gabby Agbonlahor clear. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut the Villa skipper’s shot drifted wide of the far post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWarnock’s awkward landing saw him replaced by Gary Gardner while Pulis sent on Jermaine Pennant and Peter Crouch for Jones and Etherington. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt paid off as Pennant delivered the pinpoint free-kick which led to Stoke’s equaliser. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe winger whipped in a wicked centre and, from six yards, Huth climbed above Collins to power his close-range header high into the roof of the net. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN - ANDREAS WEIMANN </b>(Villa) </p>\n<p>\n<b>ASTON VILLA: </b>Given 6, Hutton 6, Collins 6, Baker 6, Lichaj 6, Bannan 6 (N’Zogbia 5), Ireland 7, Herd 7 (Heskey 5), Warnock 6 (Gardner 5), Weimann 8, Agbonlahor 6.

We’ve not had the best luck this season — we’ve had injuries to key players such as Vidic and Fletcher.\n</p>\n<p>\n“So a lot of credit has to go to the lads who have stepped in.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the early weeks of the campaign, it looked as though it could be a season of transition for Alex Ferguson’s champions.\n</p>\n<p>\nGiggs added: “There was also the experience we’ve lost. Scholesy for half the season, Edwin van der Sar, John O’Shea, Wes Brown.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then the challenge we faced in bringing in a new goalkeeper.\n</p>\n<p>\n“David de Gea came in for a lot of criticism early on but he’s worked hard and he’s showing terrific form at a key time.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then there’s all the new talent we’ve blooded so winning it would be a massive achievement.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe return of fellow golden oldie Scholes has been the catalyst for an amazing run of form by the champions.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince the 37-year-old midfielder came out of retirement in January, United have taken 34 points from a possible 36 to leave rivals Manchester City floundering.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Giggs said: “Scholesy coming back was a massive bonus for us at the time, having him on the pitch and around the place in training. He’s still the best trainer — you can’t get the ball off him. He does things other players can’t do.”\n</p>\n<p>\nGiggs has also been instrumental for United again — with his last-gasp winner at Norwich in February looking like one of the defining moments of the season.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe recalled: “You could see what it meant to us in the celebrations. It was pure emotion, pure relief.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It was massively important and it definitely gave everyone in the squad, as well as the fans, a lift.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You need those moments in a season if you are going to go on and win the league. Moments like that provide belief and boost confidence — just look at what Federico Macheda’s goal against Villa did for us a few years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Who knows? That game at Norwich may turn out to be one of those days we look back on as being pivotal.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this kind of form, United seem highly unlikely to take their eye off the ball and let their eight point lead slip.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Giggs insists his team-mates will not take anything for granted between now and the end of the season on May 13.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat run in starts against Wigan tomorrow night. And Giggs added: “You concentrate on doing your thing and looking after your own form personally and as a team. That is what we’ve done.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We are experienced enough to know that there are still plenty of points to be gained and lost.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Until it is mathematically impossible for us to be caught, we won’t be counting our chickens. We never do.”\n</p>\n<p>\n“The key word is momentum. We’ve chased down teams before and been chased down ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n“What you’re looking for is a bit of form at the right time and then feed off positive results and go on a roll.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I think we’re doing that at the moment.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4246007/Paul-Scholes-is-a-Man-Utd-great-says-Alex-Ferguson.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"And after all... you’re my wonder Paul"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4245678/Manchester-United-2-0-QPR-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Manchester Utd 2 QPR 0"}}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01487/giggs_1487187a.jpg","caption":"LEGENDS ...
