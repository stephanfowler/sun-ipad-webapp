And the following day he met party girl Jennifer again, though they did not have sex on that occasion. </p>\n<p>\nTheir relationship was unlikely given Balotelli taunted her about her threesome with Rooney when he spotted her in a restaurant last year. Shocked diners heard him chant “Rooney, Rooney” at her as she walked past tables. </p>\n<p>\nBalotelli finally called time on the fling after revealing he had a regular girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\nA friend of Jennifer said: “It wasn’t just a one-off. Jenny saw Mario five or so times and they had sex twice. </p>\n<p>\n“The first time was after a night out in Manchester and he invited her back to a party at his mansion. A fair bit of champagne was flowing and things moved on from there. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“Jenny had no idea he had a girlfriend. He was acting like a single man. He knew she was the girl who had the threesome with Rooney. But that didn’t put him off at all. He asked her all about it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pal added: “Jenny was stunned Mario was interested in her. The last time they met in the restaurant he had been really nasty to her. But Mario was all smiles and charming. He turned it on and Jenny was flattered. </p>\n<p>\n“Mario is the biggest star in football and he wanted to be with her. Jenny has been burned by her involvement with footballers before but she fell for it. </p>\n<p>\n“He was caring, loving, sensual and made her feel special. But she hasn’t seen him since her birthday last month. One night he told her about Raffaella and that was the end of it.” </p>\n<p>\nBalotelli’s agent Mino Raiola yesterday admitted the player had a “brief involvement” with Jennifer. He called Balotelli “young and impulsive” and claimed he was a target for girls who “chase” footballers. </p>\n<p>\nMr Raiola added: “Mario prefers to admit what has happened, has refused any means to try to keep the matter silent and will deal with any consequences his actions bring in the way of public attention.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRooney had his hotel threesome while his wife Coleen was pregnant. And for a time, it left their marriage on a knife edge. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nr.moriarty@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Wayne Rooney romp ...

Sara Payne has been helping victims of paedophiles since her daughter was killed","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01484/SNF0512A--_1484391a.jpg","section":"news","headline":"Sara in plea for blitz on paedos","teaser":"MUM of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne says the problem is spiralling out of control","byline":"By ANTONELLA LAZZERI","timestamp":"Thu, 05 Apr 2012 01:07:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nTHE mum of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne is sickened at how Britain’s paedophile problem is spiralling out of control. </p>\n<p>\nThousands of sick perverts are going unpunished across the country, according to figures revealed by the NSPCC yesterday. </p>\n<p>\nAnd campaigner Sara Payne — whose eight-year-old daughter was killed in 2000 by a known paedophile — is horrified at the shocking statistics. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “It has been a really tough couple of years for me, but I will never give up. And this report just goes to show why. </p>\n<p>\n“Britain is overrun by paedophiles and their legally-aided human rights solicitors. It is high time we did something meaningful about the way they get away with it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“It is our children who will pay the price for these failures.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Sun yesterday revealed that the NSPCC had obtained figures showing that there were 23,097 child sex offences in England and Wales last year — or one child being abused every 20 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nBut only ten per cent of offences reported led to a person being convicted and sentenced. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSara, who became the country’s first Victims’ Champion — an independent voice for the victims of crime — in 2009, said she was “sickened” by the NSPCC report. </p>\n<p>\nThe 43-year-old — who campaigned to have Sarah’s Law introduced, which allows worried parents to discover whether people in contact with their kids have a criminal record — said: “This week is the first anniversary of the national launch of Sarah’s Law. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“It was set up to help parents protect their children from known paedophiles. </p>\n<p>\n“The latest figures show over 200 children have been protected. I feel an enormous sense of pride in what is happening in my daughter’s name. </p>\n<p>\n“Things like the latest shocking NSPCC report drive me on. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“Not enough is being done for children in peril. They are not given enough support to bring the evil people who do these things to justice. The system completely lets them down.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n“To get paedophile victims to come forward, stop calling indecent images of children ‘child porn’. It’s offensive. </p>\n<p>\n“For better conviction rates, give victims a legally-aided solicitor. They need one to help them through the justice system and to fight on their behalf when it lets them down. </p>\n<p>\n“Defendants get one from the moment they are arrested. Victims need one too. </p>\n<p>\n“For better justice and public protection do the only thing that actually works — put paedophiles in jail for longer. Sentences should reflect the real harm done. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>“Much, much more needs to be done to help the victims recover.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Sarah was murdered, Sara also lost her brother, her mother, then her father. Her marriage broke down and, in 2009, she suffered a devastating stroke which left her partially paralysed. </p>\n<p>\nAfter such difficult challenges, you may expect her to be the last person to be feeling positive. But Sara — who was awarded the MBE in 2008 for her child protection work — has bounced back and teamed up with fellow campaigner and victim’s advocate Shy Keenan. </p>\n<p>\nShy, 48, was sexually abused from the age of four and sold to sex fiends by her evil stepfather for just £15. Her abusers were finally jailed in 2002 after a TV exposé. </p>\n<p>\nThese two strong women in 2004 formed The Phoenix Chief Advocates to help victims of paedophiles. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the last decade they have campaigned tirelessly together. And in 2008 both Sara and Shy were awarded the Woman Of The Year gong for their work with victims. The pair have also written a bestselling book, Where Angels Fear. </p>\n<p>\nNow the two women are going into battle once again. They are launching a new website to give victims of paedophiles a place where they can get support and advice safely online. </p>\n<p>\n<i>They want to show victims of abuse there is a life worth living.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Their new free online service, thephoenixpost.com</a>, is aimed at helping both victims of abuse and child protectors. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSara said: “It is about learning to stand up for yourself but it is also about showing the rest of the world how absolutely amazing all the victims are.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe site has its own YouTube TV channel, an online radio station and a vibrant social network. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Shy and Sara need £60,000 in funding to complete the project. </p>\n<p>\nSara said: “We started building thephoenixpost.com in January using only the free online services available. If we are to make this all it can be, we need to raise sponsorship. </p>\n<p>\n“Our experience has shown that often victims feel they have no one to turn to. This website is a new chapter in mine and Shy’s lives. </p>\n<p>\n“We feel it can do so much good for those who need help. But we really need money to get it running properly and we are calling on Sun readers to help us. They have been fantastic to us in the past and we know they will realise how important thephoenixpost.com is.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShy added: “As I well know, child abuse victims often feel stigmatised. As you grow up, you feel it is not something you can tell people. It isn’t something you feel you could ever confide to friends or employers — people just treat you differently when they know. We are hoping to make The Phoenix Post the place that people can go to for the information they want and the support they need to help challenge the misconceptions of victims of paedophile crimes. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“Victims can and do survive, and they thrive so much better when we help them.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nOver the past ten years Shy and Sara have helped countless victims, including Paul, who wrote to thank them for their help. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “My first contact with The Phoenix Chief Advocates was in October 2004. I was one of William Goad’s victims. He received a life sentence for decades of sexual abuse against young boys. </p>\n<p>\n“Shy and Sara acted as advocates for the men who gave evidence against him. Many of us had deeply entrenched mental health issues, some of us used drugs to mask the pain. Our lives were shattered by the legacy he left us to carry. There was no support available in the aftermath of the trial. The Phoenix Chiefs tried in vain to find an organisation that could help. </p>\n<p>\n“All the lads trusted Shy and Sara, which was a very rare thing as many of us had issues surrounding trust. They never lied to us. </p>\n<p>\n“The Phoenix Chiefs advised not to let the anger overwhelm us and to use our Phoenix fire to stand up for ourselves. They informed us of our right to appeal against Goad’s minimum tariff of six years before he could apply for parole. They supported us through the process.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPaul also told how Shy encouraged him to set up a self-help group for the victims of Goad, who may have abused up to 3,500 boys. </p>\n<p>\nThis has grown into Operation Emotion which, along with regular meetings, offers victims the help of counsellors and an art therapist. Help is also available to women and child victims of sex crimes. </p>\n<p>\nPaul said: “I am immensely proud of Operation Emotion’s achievements over the years. But if I never had the Phoenix Chiefs to encourage me, to believe in myself and to educate me, this would probably never have happened. </p>\n<p>\n“You can’t imagine how lonely it is being a child victim of sex crimes. You grow up in silence thinking you’re the only one. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“So when you can share and find common ground with others, that’s priceless. The Phoenix Chiefs taught me that.”</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nHow you can help </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br> <b>Visit thephoenixpost.com</a>, click on ‘How to help us’ and use the secure PayPal link to leave a much-needed donation.

I told them about the burning sensation and they said I was probably suffering from heartburn and gave me a glass of milk. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only when I collapsed that they took me to A&E. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctors discovered I was bleeding internally — I had no blood in my veins — and sent me for urgent tests. I couldn’t understand what was happening to me. I was 26 with no previous medical problems. </p>\n<p>\nBut I could feel myself slipping in and out of consciousness. Much of that night is a blur but I later found out doctors had discovered three tumours on my liver, one of which had burst causing massive internal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\nThankfully, the tumours were benign but I later found out that if I hadn’t been admitted to hospital when I was, I could have died from blood loss. </p>\n<p>\nI had several blood transfusions and an emergency operation that night to remove the burst tumour. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, my parents made the 125-mile journey from Aberdeen while I was in surgery. I was in a critical condition and they’ve since told me they were terrified I wouldn’t make it. </p>\n<p>\nI remember waking up in the hospital and being very confused. </p>\n<p>\nI’d been in a coma for two days and I’d been placed on life support while my condition stabilised. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctors said the operation had been a success and the burst tumour, which was six inches long, had been removed — as had a third of my liver. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctors explained that a person can survive on just 25 per cent of their liver while it regenerates. </p>\n<p>\nMy liver was so damaged that it was too dangerous to remove the smaller tumours, which were around two inches long, so I had to wait for them to shrink. I’m amazed I couldn’t feel the tumours but it’s fairly common not to experience any symptoms until they burst and leave you in agony. </p>\n<p>\nBut the biggest shock was to come, when the doctors explained that the most likely cause of the tumours (or to use the medical term, hepatic adenomas) was my contraceptive Pill. </p>\n<p>\nI’d been taking a popular brand of the combined Pill for 11 years with no side effects so it was difficult getting my head round the idea my Pill might be to blame. </p>\n<p>\nIt turned out the hormones in the Pill, either oestrogen or progesterone, had caused the tumours to develop, a rare reaction which occurs in less than one in a million women. </p>\n<p>\nThe odds increase the longer you’ve been taking the Pill but it’s still incredibly rare. </p>\n<p>\nI was obviously one of the unlucky ones. I wasn’t able to take legal action against the manufacturer of my Pill, as it said in the small print this could be a rare reaction, but if I’d known I’d never have taken them. </p>\n<p>\nI now have to steer clear of hormones which means I’ll always have to rely on condoms for contraception as not only can I not take the Pill but I’m unable to use other forms of contraception which contain hormones, such as the coil or the implant. </p>\n<p>\nIt also means I might have issues if I ever get pregnant, as pregnancy hormones (which are mimicked by the Pill) are known to have caused the same condition. </p>\n<p>\nI’m young and single at the moment, so it doesn’t affect me yet, but I hate to think about it. </p>\n<p>\nA year on, I’ve made a full recovery and, now that I’m not taking the Pill, the remaining tumours have shrunk. </p>\n<p>\nI still have to have regular check-ups every six months and an MRI scan once a year but as long I stay away from hormones I’ll be ok. </p>\n<p>\nWhat I do have is an eight-inch scar across my stomach. It’s a constant reminder of what happened to me. </p>\n<p>\nLike many women, I thought the Pill was a “wonder drug”, I thought the worst side effects were a bit of bloating, but I was wrong. </p>\n<p>\nIt’s taken a brush with death to make me realise that, for me, it’s just not worth the risk.” <br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Gabrielle Downey, consultant gynaecologist at BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nOESTROGEN can cause benign and cancerous tumours but this is very rare and, despite looking after hundreds of women a year who are on the Pill, I’ve only seen two liver tumours. </p>\n<p>\nSome women will develop jaundice or decreased liver function, but again these are very unusual. </p>\n<p>\nTumours like Suzi’s are formed when the gland cells develop into cystic structures. </p>\n<p>\nWhen the blood supply bleeds in, the lining gets thinner and they suddenly burst like a balloon, leading to haemorrhaging. You won’t notice anything unless a tumour causes an obstruction. The condition is also idiosyncratic, which means you don’t know until it happens. </p>\n<p>\nBut the contraceptive Pill itself is largely very safe. Taking a combined Pill protects you against some cancers such as ovarian cancer. </p>\n<p>\nThere’s a slightly increased risk of cervical cancer, probably because most women on the Pill aren’t using condoms which protect against infection. </p>\n<p>\nOne of the main risks associated with the Pill is of clotting or deep vein thrombosis – it’s four in 100,000 for women not taking the Pill and this doubles for those who are taking it. The risk increases if you’re sitting for long periods of time, such as on a flight, so if you’re travelling I’d recommend taking one aspirin the day you fly and one the day after. </p>\n<p>\nThese risks also increase if you are overweight or a smoker. </p>\n<p>\nAlways discuss with your doctor if you have concerns about your contraceptive Pill. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Rare reaction ...

She was way better than her stunt double. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s not afraid to get bruised or cut. All the stuff her stunt double would normally do, she was doing herself. I taught her how to handle the weapons. When she had a gun in her hand she couldn’t stop smiling. She loved it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Rihanna herself offered the ultimate praise to her trigger-happy mentor. She said: “My character’s name is Raikes. She’s a weapons officer, she’s not afraid of anything. She loves weapons, she knows them — not only her weapons, but every other weapon on the ship. </p>\n<p>\n“We had this bad ass chick on set, her name is Jackie, she was also in the Navy. I was playing what she does in real life. She was all tattooed up and I just looked at her and I was like, ‘You are Raikes’. </p>\n<p>\n“I watched her and really tried to get in her character. She’s fearless and she’s one of the boys and it’s really fun to explore that.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>The Sun tracked down Jackie to her first workplace since completing a four-year stint in the Navy — at a machine gun range in Las Vegas where she has continued to be surrounded by her beloved guns. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBetween firing Uzis at an Osama Bin Laden target, Jackie lifted the lid on her month with Rihanna in Hawaii, where the film was shot. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “I can’t believe she said I was a bad ass — she was a bad ass too. She was shooting a mini gun — an electric machine gun — and I was helping her. </p>\n<p>\n“When it was time to shoot I told her not to be nervous and to have fun with it. When she finished she was grinning from ear to ear and said, ‘I see why you love this stuff’. </p>\n<p>\n“I showed her how to hold the gun so she’d look a little more professional. And there is one scene where she was dragging one of the guys out and I helped her out with how to pick him up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“There was another part when she was playing soccer. I was teaching her that too. She said she loved my tattoos.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJackie revealed how she was spotted by director Peter playing in the military tournament. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “He wanted to take a picture of my T-shirt. It was a picture of a guy screaming into the crowd at a concert and it says, ‘Bring the hate’. It’s from a hardcore punk band called The Hoods. </p>\n<p>\n“I went back to the ship and later I got an email from Mr Berg, saying, ‘I’m the weirdo who took pictures of your shirt.’\n</p>\n<p>\n“He said, ‘Do you want to work with me on this movie I’m making with Rihanna? If not, it’s cool. You’re still a bad ass. Pete’. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m kind of a workaholic so I don’t watch TV. All I knew about Rihanna was that she was a pop star. I’d never listened to her music — it’s not my kind of thing. I was on deployment and I said I couldn’t help — there was no way, because I was on active duty. </p>\n<p>\n“But he wrote back and he had friends on my ship. A few days later the captain came and asked me if I knew Peter Berg or anything about working on a movie with him. I couldn’t believe it. I was like, ‘Oh man, it’s for real’.”\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce on set in Hawaii, Jackie became more than Rihanna’s naval mentor — the Barbados beauty’s entire part was adapted to be based on the real-life sailor. </p>\n<p>\nSingle girl Jackie recalled: “Peter liked the way I was a tomboy and took part in all this male-dominated stuff. He made her character more like me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“When Rihanna played soccer she was really aggressive, like I am — pushing rival players out of the way. And for the soccer scene they even put her in the Hoods T-shirt that the director first saw me in.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJackie told Rihanna about her four years in the Navy as a gunner’s mate. She said: “I was a supervisor and was really mean, very demanding. I’m a perfectionist and I wanted my team to be the same.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe now works at Machine Guns Vegas, a firing range where she is one of six sexy safety officers who show the venue’s visitors how to fire some of the world’s most dangerous guns. </p>\n<p>\nRihanna’s own attitude to weapons has come under fire in the past after she wore fashion accessories featuring images of guns. </p>\n<p>\nFor her role in Battleship — which opens on April 11 — she even had a temporary tattoo of a pistol on her thigh. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jackie defended the controversial right to own guns in America. She also backed gun ranges such as the one where she works. </p>\n<p>\nMGV has been slammed by anti-gun campaigners for luring British tourists with their aggressive marketing promising dangerous weapons and attractive women. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jackie said: “A lot of Brits get excited around the guns, especially because we have a lot of hot girls that work here. </p>\n<p>\n“I don’t think I’ve seen a single person walk out of the range not smiling. It should be your right to buy a weapon — but it should come with great responsibility. </p>\n<p>\n“As long as you are safe and following the rules then no one is going to get hurt. It’s when you get complacent and start ignoring the rules that things go wrong. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“It’s like anything.

Lots of rather serious-looking men walking around dressed in silly shoes and socks and the sort of collared T-shirts your aunty buys everyone for Christmas. </p>\n<p>\nNot your sort of thing? </p>\n<p>\nWell don’t dismiss it completely, because what we will undoubtedly suffer in the fashion stakes, we will gain in the WAGs department. </p>\n<p>\nBecause the world’s leading golfers offer us a rather unique group of partners to look at, dissect and admire. </p>\n<p>\nHovering delicately on the sidelines at The Masters are a group of WAGs who look alarmingly skin coloured. </p>\n<p>\nThat’s right! You read that correctly — the shock news in Augusta is not whether Tiger Woods beats Britain’s leading golfer, Luke Donald, but that the WAGs are <b>NOT</b> the colour of cheesy wotsits. </p>\n<p>\nUnlike their footballing counterparts, the golf WAGs (GWAGs) are not vibrant orange, bikini wearing, sunglasses-addicted shopaholics. </p>\n<p>\nAnd as they assemble at one of the most beautiful events in sport, there will be some seriously talented sportswomen in the mix. </p>\n<p>\nTake Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy. </p>\n<p>\nHe’s not just dating a sportswoman, he’s dating the sportswoman to end all sportswomen — Caroline Wozniacki, the uber gorgeous and glamorous Danish tennis player right at the top of her game. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTogether they make the super sports partnership known as Wozilroy. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s great that she understands how I feel when I play,” says McIlroy, using words that have never knowingly been spoken by an international footballer. “She understands what I need to achieve and supports me all the way.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt’s alarming, to say the least, and you may wish to sit down as you read the rest of this. </p>\n<p>\nWe’ve become used to WAGs who pride themselves on not understanding the offside rule before staggering off on 9in heels, in tiny lime green hotpants, in search of Bacardi and stupidly expensive champagne. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But this is golf — they do things differently here. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd McIlroy is certainly not alone in his penchant for a sports-loving partner. </p>\n<p>\nAmerican Matt Kuchar’s wife Sybi is an avid tennis player. In fact, the duo have entered tennis tournaments together. </p>\n<p>\nThere’s no record of how well they do in their doubles efforts but Kuchar said: “I love the fact that she’s sporty. Life’s more fun with someone who ‘gets you’ and understands what you’re about. I like that we want the same things from life.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd what is particularly heart-warming is that the support and appreciation is not a one-way street. McIlroy has been seen supporting his girlfriend in tennis tournaments around the world, even going on to court and having a go at the sport himself <i>(the verdict on his tennis? He should stick to golf)</i>. </p>\n<p>\nSergio Garcia is another tennis enthusiast. He is WAG-free, but dated former world No1 tennis player Martina Hingis, supporting her tennis as much as she supported his golf. “We help each other,” he said. “That’s what a partnership is.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSadly, someone who won’t be there today is Nick Dougherty, denying us the sight of his golf-mad television presenter wife Diana, who says she lives for golf — just like Victoria Beckham lives for football... not. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAmerican Bubba Watson will be there though, ably supported by wife, Angie — a world-class basketball player whose career was cut short by injury. </p>\n<p>\nAngie is 6ft 4in and a mean golfer. “You wouldn’t argue with her on a golf course,” says Bubba. Nor anywhere else if she’s 6ft 4in tall, I imagine. </p>\n<p>\nFor golf enthusiasts, one of the biggest stories at the Augusta National club this year will be how the world’s most famous golfer — Tiger Woods — performs, and how he plays against McIlroy. The more pressing question, for WAG watchers, will be whether Woods is “Wagged up” for the occasion. </p>\n<p>\nHe’s been linked with Alyse Lahti Johnson since his marriage disappeared in an explosion of newspaper headlines a few years ago. </p>\n<p>\nHe says he’s wary of bringing his new girlfriend into the spotlight and subjecting her to public scrutiny, so the first Major tournament of the season might not be the best place to bring her. </p>\n<p>\nBut then again — whenever he’s seen with her, there’ll be vast public interest, so why not in the beautiful surroundings of Augusta? Another WAG to look out for is former international gymnast Kate Rose, married to Justin Rose. </p>\n<p>\nShe persuaded her husband to work through some of her old gymnastics moves when he had a bad back and managed to alleviate all his pain. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m a sportswoman, I understood instinctively what was needed,” she said. Sadly, there are no pictures of him doing splits on the beam in a leotard. </p>\n<p>\n“Going out with a former sportswoman has its advantages,” said Justin. So it seems, judging by the number of leading golfers who do. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nBeauties giving game glamour </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Left:</b> Stunning birdie Kate Rose is married to England ace Justin.

For the older generation items such as the washing machine really did make a huge difference to their lives. </p>\n<p>\n“For the younger generation, products and designs such as the bra often enhance what they’ve already got.”\n</p>\n<p>\nChristine added: “The Pill is also important because it gave women the freedom to choose when to have children and how many to have. </p>\n<p>\n“It gave women a confidence we’d never had before.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBarmaid Clare Hughes, from Hamble, Hants, said: “I agree with the findings, bras are one of the best inventions. </p>\n<p>\n“In the past they were practical, now they’re more fashionable. </p>\n<p>\n“When I’m wearing a nice bra it gives me a boost and makes my clothes look nicer. I’d never buy a cheap one”. </p>\n<p>\nThe 33-year-old added: “The washing machine is a revolutionary invention too. </p>\n<p>\n“I don’t know how women coped without them.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmy Jenkins, of Clearblue Plus, said: “It’s interesting to see that good design can have such a positive impact on women’s day-to-day lives.”\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nTop 10 inventions <br></br>\n</h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>1 </b>The contraceptive pill </p>\n<p>\n<b>2</b> The bra </p>\n<p>\n<b>3</b> The washing machine </p>\n<p>\n<b>4</b> Tampons </p>\n<p>\n<b>5 </b>Pregnancy tests </p>\n<p>\n<b>6</b> Disposable nappies </p>\n<p>\n<b>7</b> Mascara </p>\n<p>\n<b>8</b> Jeans </p>\n<p>\n<b>9 </b>Fresh prepared meals </p>\n<p>\n<b>10</b> Contact lenses </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Oestrogenius ...

People with prostate cancer obviously aren’t youngsters and probably worked all their lives as well. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI thought when I started work many years ago that you paid into the system. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI never thought I’d ever see a situation where there was treatment that would be good for me that I couldn’t have.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nBob Bonthrone, 75 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>RETIRED finance manager Bob, married to Margaret, 77, learned he had prostate cancer in 2003. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Bob, from Stirlingshire, Scotland, has tried all other available treatments and was devastated when he was turned down for Abiraterone. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>It would cost the NHS more than £35,000 for a year’s supply. </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I don’t believe you can put a price on life. I’m astonished that the drug has been turned down and Margaret is devastated. After the announcement, the look on her face said it all. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI’m going through more chemotherapy at the moment but what do I have to look forward to after that? I can’t see why a very effective drug that was developed in the UK can’t be used to help the people of the UK. It doesn’t seem excessively expensive. It has helped some men live for another four years. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy wife and I had so much to look forward to. We were planning on exploring the world. This was going to be our time to enjoy life. It was a shock when I was told that it had actually spread to my pelvis and lymph nodes. But I was determined to get through it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI started hormone therapy treatment which helped me to get my life back a bit. But by the end of 2008, the pain had returned. The therapy was no longer working and the cancer had spread to other parts of my body. </p>\n<p>\nI had chemotherapy and I took part in a clinical trial of Cabazitaxel, which helped slow the progress of the cancer. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMargaret and I celebrated our golden wedding anniversary in June 2009 with our two children and four grandchildren. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was a really special party. We had a collection for charity and thanked the NHS for all the excellent treatment I’d had. But now the NHS won’t fund Abiraterone. We really need this drug. It doesn’t seem very expensive when you compare it with the money being paid out to help women who were fitted with PIP breast implants and now need them taken out. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe NHS even pay for people to have tattoos removed. Why do people with prostate cancer come last on the list?”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b><br></br>By OWEN SHARP, CEO of The Prostate Cancer Charity</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABIRATERONE allows men dying of prostate cancer to live a longer and better life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis pill, developed by British scientists, is one of the biggest breakthroughs in the treatment of the disease in years. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt is appalling to think the men who need it most risk being told they can’t have it due to the cost. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe NHS may be bogged down with financial woes but the fact remains that this drug can increase the amount of time a man with prostate cancer has left to live by an average of about four months. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAbiraterone also reduces pain with very few side effects, giving men the best possible opportunity to enjoy their last few months. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSadly, while NICE and the drugs company are quibbling about cost, men are dying. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAn extra four months of life could give a man the time to walk his daughter down the aisle, see the birth of a grandchild or just spend special time with friends and family. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAt least a third of the 10,000 men who will die from prostate cancer this year would have more time if this drug was available to them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nUndoubtedly NICE has some hard decisions to make – but isn’t it time that we all put the patients first? </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"One smalls step ...

She has now been with Dave Norman, 28, a tiler, for 18 months and says she wouldn’t be happy in any relationship where she is not allowed to see her ex. They are all from Bristol. Lucy says:</b> </p>\n<p>\n“I met Dom in September 2008. We were both students and I fell for him because he was so easy to talk to. </p>\n<p>\nWe became great friends first, then evolved into boyfriend and girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\nWe moved in together after a year and all was going well until our mutual friend blurted out she had slept with Dom. </p>\n<p>\nI was utterly crushed and my trust of Dom evaporated. </p>\n<p>\nDespite my anger at him breaking us up, Dom and I would bump into each other at university, we had the same mutual friends and I found it impossible to ignore him. </p>\n<p>\nGradually we became friends again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe shared so much together in such an exciting period of our lives and that bond couldn’t be broken. </p>\n<p>\nWe talk about everything together and he’s a great listener. </p>\n<p>\nBut I’d never trust him as a boyfriend again. </p>\n<p>\nI met Dave a year after splitting from Dom and we hit it off. </p>\n<p>\nDave knows all about what happened between me and Dom. At first he couldn’t understand why I’d want to be friends with him. </p>\n<p>\nBut he soon came to understand how supportive Dom had been as a friend — and still is. </p>\n<p>\nSo far it’s working out nicely. </p>\n<p>\nThe boys get on fine when we meet up together but I’m not sure if they would be friends in their own right. </p>\n<p>\nDom and I meet up for coffees or early-evening drinks at least once a week. </p>\n<p>\nI don’t discuss relationship problems with him though, I have girlfriends for that. </p>\n<p>\nI feel lucky that I have a boyfriend who understands. If he didn’t, things could get complicated.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Boyfriend Dave says: </b>“I’m cool with Lucy’s friendship with Dom. </p>\n<p>\n“Dom and I are completely different — I wouldn’t go out drinking with him. </p>\n<p>\n“But he’s funny and I have to respect him because Lucy does.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ex Dom says: </b>“To throw away the bond Lucy and I formed would be impossible. </p>\n<p>\n“I know I screwed up but it was completely out of character and I’m very lucky to still have Lucy as a friend. </p>\n<p>\n“I’ve got friends who can’t be friends with their exes so I see myself as fortunate to have Lucy in my life still. </p>\n<p>\n“I really think we’ll be in touch for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>NO, says Suzanne Parker, 36 </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>\n<b>SUZANNE, who runs a menswear shop in Ormskirk, Lancs, was given an ultimatum: Stay friends with her ex and lose her boyfriend.

I was hurt and shocked by his reaction. I told him he couldn’t control me and my friendships. </p>\n<p>\nBut he remained adamant it was Martin or him. </p>\n<p>\nI was torn. </p>\n<p>\nI didn’t want to sacrifice a friendship over somebody’s jealousy, but I’d really fallen for Adam and didn’t want to throw away what we had. </p>\n<p>\nFor the next month I carried on phoning Martin and each time Adam found out he went ballistic. We had the most awful rows. </p>\n<p>\nEventually Adam moved out. </p>\n<p>\nI really missed him and phoned to ask him to come home, but he told me that he only would if I stopped talking to my ex, Martin. </p>\n<p>\nI didn’t want to choose. </p>\n<p>\nI was terribly upset that it ended the way it did, but maybe this proves it wasn’t meant to be between us.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Security worker Adam Smith, 32, says: </b>“I didn’t like the idea of ex-boyfriends being in the background — it felt like an intrusion. </p>\n<p>\n“Suzanne wouldn’t have it though and it was stressing me out so I left. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s over now and it’s all because she wanted to stay friends with her ex.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Martin Hollenby, 33, a woodworker, says:</b> “It’s sad what happened, but I don’t see why Suzie and I couldn’t be friends. </p>\n<p>\n“There was nothing going on between us.

But Lily is certainly more youthful and current. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun, she says: “Someone told me they were listening to the radio and they were playing classic hits. At the end the DJ came on and said, ‘For all of you who don’t know, that was Phil Collins — Lily Collins’s dad’. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I thought that was the weirdest thing, just so bizarre. Even my dad has said to me, ‘You know, I am known as your dad now’.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n“But he is extremely proud and couldn’t be happier. He came to the premiere the other day and we were just like a huge family. It was so lovely to have Mum and Dad there. </p>\n<p>\n“It is a weird shift. I am doing what I am now because I am doing it — I never wanted to give anybody the ability to say I am doing something because of family.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUnderstandably, Lily is worried people will think having a famous father opened doors for her in the movie industry, giving her an unfair advantage. But there are plenty of sons and daughters of rock stars who have tried and failed to make it in Hollywood. </p>\n<p>\nPhil, 61, who was an actor before he became a rock star with Genesis, has commented about how difficult Lily’s family background has made it for her. He once said: “She’s always got this thing hanging around her neck — she’s Phil Collins’s daughter.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLily thinks Dad was just defending her and says: “He is probably just referencing what everyone assumes — that having the last name gives me an opportunity and protecting me from that.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhether being Phil’s daughter has helped or hindered, Lily certainly didn’t get her stunning looks from Dad. For those remarkable eyes she has mum Jill Tavelman to thank. </p>\n<p>\nLily says: “I have seen that more and more. I am seeing characteristics, things that I do that are very her. And I look at photos sometimes and see her smile and her laugh. More and more people are saying that now — and I love it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJill was Phil’s second wife. They married in 1984 and divorced 12 years later. After the break-up, Lily, then seven, went to live with her mother in Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nThe split was said to be acrimonious, with Phil paying out £17million and finishing the relationship by fax. But now it seems they are friendly again. </p>\n<p>\nLily, whose birthday was on March 18, says: “I celebrated my 23rd with my mum and dad, who were both here in LA the day after the premiere. We had a very relaxed, quiet day together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough she mainly grew up in the States, Surrey-born Lily has fond memories of an English childhood spent in the company of some of the UK’s biggest stars — including Elton John, who used to babysit her. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “He is definitely a close family friend. I consider myself very European and more British at heart. </p>\n<p>\n“I am not your beachy Californian girl. I enjoy the cold. Whenever I come back to England I automatically relax and feel at home.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLily reckons spending her early years in England helped to prepare her for the Snow White role. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I grew up in England in the countryside in basically farmland and forests. </p>\n<p>\n“I used to run around pretending. I was read fairytales before bedtime and I was totally the young girl who loved fairytale princesses. </p>\n<p>\n“The idea of playing one never crossed my mind and when it happened, at first I thought it was a mistake. But it was an absolute honour and I was so excited to do it that the importance of playing this iconic role didn’t truly hit home until I finished shooting, so I didn’t get to be nervous about it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: “To play a character that is the fairest of them all is even hard for me to say — it is the most bizarre concept to me. </p>\n<p>\n“In our story Snow White never once looks in the mirror, so she is unaware of the beauty everyone is talking about. She doesn’t know what effect it has on people.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Lily too is confused by the effect she is having on people, with fan sites dedicated to her already springing up. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “It still shocks me that people are interested in me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“But I can still go about everyday life, go to the market and that kind of thing, without being followed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLily’s first acting role came at the tender age of <b>TWO</b> on BBC television comedy drama Growing Pains. </p>\n<p>\nBefore her adult acting career she worked as a journalist for American youth channel Nickleodeon and for British teen magazines such as Elle Girl. She admits it was a way to get experience in front of the camera and a job to do as she waited for her big chance in Hollywood. </p>\n<p>\nThe break came when she played the daughter of Sandra Bullock’s character in the Oscar-nominated 2009 film The Blind Side. After that success she decided to concentrate on acting. </p>\n<p>\nTalking about her time as a reporter, she says: “I was always pursuing acting at the same time. I was just auditioning but being told no and so I kept practising. At the same time I wanted to be doing something else. Then I was finally told yes on The Blind Side and there came a point when I had to decide whether the audience could believe me as the character when I was also on television as me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDad Phil started acting young, having gone to drama school at 14 and appearing as the Artful Dodger in a London production of Oliver! </p>\n<p>\nLily says: “I have always loved dressing up. I was also supported by my family. Me and my dad obviously share a love of acting.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>And they are far from being the only star dad-and-daughter acting team — as our picture gallery, below left, shows.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis new version of Snow White portrays the princess as a strong young woman who is as brave as her prince. </p>\n<p>\nLily says: “I wanted to play her as a young girl that other young girls could relate to. </p>\n<p>\n“I got to do all these things I have never done before, like fencing and running round in ball gowns and corsets in forests.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFor Lily, there is a similarity between herself and this modern princess. She is not the type of girl who simply lives off her parent’s fame but wants to make her own way in the world. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “She’s a feisty, passionate young woman. I’d definitely say that when I set my mind on something, I really go for it.”\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>g.rollings@the-sun.co.uk</b></a>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Thrill Collins ... lovely Lily is carving out a promising Hollywood career","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/LILY-MAIN-_1483709a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNF04SPD4-532a_1483712a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNF04SPD5--5321_1483711a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNF04SPD6-5323_1483710a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNF04SPD2---5321_1483713a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"Julia Roberts is the fairest of them all","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/3858919/Julia-Roberts-is-the-fairest-of-them-all.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Zac Efron woos Lily Collins in LA","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4133774/Zac-Efron-girlfriend-Phil-Collins-daughter-Lily-goes-on-date-with-actor.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Ageing is Grimm for Julia Roberts","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/3939457/Ageing-is-Grimm-for-Julia-Roberts.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Rockers’ mods","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4055495/Music-worlds-beautiful-offspring.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7d6efaac2473db2f00002d"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Agony ...

Twice Arshad, then 24, was asked by firefighters if anyone else was in the vehicle. Twice he said no. Arshad was sentenced to six years for causing death by careless driving while over the alcohol limit and while uninsured. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>From prison he sent two portraits of Emily to her mum Patricia, yet he refused to see her to explain what happened. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Here, Patricia, 51, talks to NIKKI WATKINS about her agony at being denied the right to ask him why he left her daughter to die.</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFOR Patricia, every day has been a living hell since losing her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “Being told Emily had died was too much to comprehend. Emily was caring, full of life and my best friend. To lose her so violently is unimaginable. Losing a child in such an awful way changes you. I will never again be the person I was.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPatricia’s agony has been heightened by Arshad’s seemingly callous behaviour towards her family. The hospital nurse, said: “Arshad sending the portrait was disgusting. He didn’t ask the prison authorities, who would have asked me if I wanted to receive anything. </p>\n<p>\n“He passed it to a mate to deliver and took that choice away from me. Later, I heard he had applied for early release and I knew I had to ask him questions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>“He refused to see me. But he had no qualms about sending me a portrait of my daughter framed by matchsticks after she burned to death.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nPatricia last saw college student Emily, who was studying to be an accountant, when she waved her off to her part-time job on November 1, 2008. </p>\n<p>\nThe mum — who lives in Dunstable, Beds, with lorry driver husband Tom, 49, and student son Jordan, 19 — says: “Emily had a supermarket job to help fund her studies. She headed out after work with friends. Near her curfew she sent a text to her brother Jordan, then 16, telling him she would be home soon. </p>\n<p>\n“Although we were a close family we hadn’t talked much about Arshad, her boyfriend of six months. I saw his car when he dropped her off but that was it. Every time I brought him up Emily would get embarrassed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nConfident her daughter was on her way home that terrible night, Patricia went to bed. She says: “At 5am the phone rang. Seeing my daughter’s bedroom was empty I started to panic. When Emily’s name came up on the phone screen I relaxed but it wasn’t her voice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“A man told me he was Arshad’s brother and that there had been an accident and Emily was missing. He asked if she was with me. A police officer came on the line and said he would call back when there was more news. </p>\n<p>\n“I tried to comfort myself with the thought that if Emily was seriously injured, the hospital would have been in touch. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“An hour later I opened the front door to the officer and heard the words, ‘I’m sorry’. I just knew and broke down.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe officer explained there had been a crash in the early hours. Emily had died. </p>\n<p>\nPatricia would learn later that Emily’s phone had been retrieved by Arshad as he escaped from the burning wreck. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nReeling in shock, Patricia asked to see her daughter’s body. She says: “It was then they told me I couldn’t identify her body. The car had caught fire and there was none. </p>\n<p>\n“Emily had never hurt anyone, why had this happened to us? She was so innocent, she didn’t deserve to die like this. Clinging to the bannister for support, I climbed upstairs to wake Jordan. The agony on his face will stay with me for ever. It was the worst moment of my life.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family, who are Catholics, were devastated not to be able to give Emily a traditional funeral service. Her coffin contained a body bag with just a few charred remains. </p>\n<p>\nPatricia says: “After the funeral, attended by more than 1,000 of her friends, my grief worsened. Overnight I went from being a tough, working mother to lying on the sofa just about able to breathe. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I was haunted by images of her trapped, screaming for help.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShortly after the funeral, Patricia was told Arshad had been arrested but she was too consumed with grief to ask why. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWeeks later she bumped into him while visiting Emily’s grave. Patricia says: “We cried together, I hugged him and he kept saying he couldn’t remember anything.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, in May 2009, Arshad appeared at Luton Crown Court and admitted causing death by careless driving while over the drink drive limit and causing death by driving while uninsured. </p>\n<p>\nThe court heard he and Emily had been for a night out. Driving her home he lost control of the car, crashed into a tree and skidded into a field where the car caught fire. Patricia says: “What came next left me and my family stunned. </p>\n<p>\n“The court heard Arshad freed himself from the car but left Emily trapped inside. When witnesses called for emergency services, he didn’t even tell them she was in the car. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“He was asked by a paramedic and a firefighter if there was anyone in the car. To both he said no. </p>\n<p>\n“Firemen later realised Emily was in the car but by then it was too late. She had been injured during the accident but that hadn’t killed her. She had burned to death.”\n</p>\n<p>\nArshad maintained he could not remember what happened. He was sentenced to six years and banned from driving for eight. Patricia says: “I was disgusted one human could allow that to happen to another. </p>\n<p>\n“He’d had time to get Emily’s mobile phone but claimed he was in too much of a state of shock to remember she was in the car. I was left with no doubt that had he told someone she was in there, she might still be alive. </p>\n<p>\n“Emily’s death was utterly degrading. The anger and grief made me have suicidal thoughts.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Then, when Patricia thought things couldn’t get any worse, the story took another sick twist in March 2010.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nPatricia says: “Jordan had answered the door and was handed a parcel from Arshad. I gasped in shock. It was a sketch and a photo of Emily decorated with a clock. Both were framed with matchsticks. </p>\n<p>\n“To make frames out of matchsticks when he had let my daughter burn to death seemed hugely insensitive. I couldn’t look at them but I couldn’t just throw them in the bin because they were pictures of Emily. I had to put them in the loft. It was terrible. </p>\n<p>\n“Had he not considered asking me through the proper channels if I wanted to receive his gifts? </p>\n<p>\n<i>“It may be possible that he had not connected matchsticks with leaving his girlfriend to burn to death but perhaps that is being too kind.”</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast year Patricia was told Arshad had applied for early release. She says: “I knew that to be able to move forward I needed to see him face to face. I asked if I could visit him in jail but he refused to see me. </p>\n<p>\n“He is such a coward. I hope he will change his mind before he is released, which I fear could be as early as this year. I’ve read books on grief, looking for advice, and one day I plan to write my own book to help others grieving in horrific circumstances. </p>\n<p>\n“But in the meantime I hope publishing the pictures of the wreckage in which my daughter died will help save another life by stopping others from getting in a car with a drunk driver. </p>\n<p>\n“Emily would have liked that.”\n</p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>Patricia is donating her fee for this article to Sisters Of St Clare Convent in Luton.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Agony ...

Luckily I had just hoovered so I was able to put it back and finish cooking it.

The claimant said: “An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my vehicle and then vanished.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother motorist was so busy trying to swat a fly inside their car that they hit a telegraph pole. </p>\n<p>\nAnd in another accident a dog jumped into a stationary car on a steep hill, dislodging the handbrake.

I know it’s a controversial thing to get your kids involved in, but I think people read too much into it. </p>\n<p>\n“Their confidence has shot through the roof since they’ve started competing. It’s wonderful watching my kids doing so well. </p>\n<p>\n“There’s such a buzz about the UK scene — it’s fresh and exciting. It’s so rewarding being right at the forefront of it and I’ve never heard of as big a family as mine getting involved.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne’s obsession was sparked by seeing footage of American pageants and has escalated so much in the past 12 months that normal family life at their home in Lincoln has been put on hold. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “The glitz and glamour come at a high price. You’re talking at least £500 to £600 per child per competition. There’s the entry fee plus travel expenses, costumes and grooming on top. </p>\n<p>\n“The dresses alone cost £300 to £400, and you can’t wear them more than once. </p>\n<p>\n“The shoes cost up to £60 a pair. </p>\n<p>\n“Then there’s all the beauty, the hair, nails and tan.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEvenings are spent searching YouTube for clips of the biggest and best pageant stars for inspiration. </p>\n<p>\nMost nights after school the kids practise their choreography for the talent round and try out their hair and make-up. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “It’s the nature of the scene — to stay at the top, you’ve got to keep going bigger.”\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandma Joyce, 49, a former pub landlady, is a dab hand with a needle and has made countless “one-off” outfits for the troupe. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “It’s so important to have good costumes. My mum is brilliant. She’s really talented at making fabulous costumes, so thankfully we don’t have to buy them all.”\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery weekend, James, 29 — who is stepdad to the two eldest kids — looks after baby Niyah, while Leanne, Joyce, Tia, Courtney and Ellie check out shops nationwide to find fabrics and accessories. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “Our outgoings are sky-high. James and I have cut back so much. We’ve gone from taking two holidays a year to one and when we do go away we stay in the UK. </p>\n<p>\n“We don’t eat out much any more and I buy my clothes from budget stores such as Primark and Asda so I can plough money back in to the kids’ pageant wardrobe.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe result of all their effort is a mantelpiece full of awards. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “The kids are all naturals, especially Tia, who won the Tiny Miss North crown in her first ever competition. All my kids have the pageant bug — even my three-year-old son.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis year the family are going even further, as Tia prepares to become the first British competitor in the Dream Girls USA pageant in St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “In Tia’s last competition, she danced to Copacabana by Barry Manilow. </p>\n<p>\n“Some people think the song is inappropriate for an eight-year-old but she doesn’t understand the words. It’s just a good beat to perform to.” </p>\n<p>\nRecently Leanne and Joyce have found it hard to find the sort of bold, ostentatious outfits that they say are needed to stand out. </p>\n<p>\nSo they plan to launch their own online pageant boutique. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “Mum made the showgirl costume for the Copacabana dance and it went down a storm. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s really hard to find unique ‘wow-wear’ here and it’s expensive to ship it from the US. </p>\n<p>\n“This is an ideal opportunity to turn something we love into a business venture. There’s the market for it and it means that we’ll stay right at the forefront of pageant fashion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe US pageant scene has been growing for decades and has received a lot of attention in the UK. </p>\n<p>\nIt was notorious US cable TV series Toddlers & Tiaras that first got full-time mum Leanne hooked. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “We would watch it as a family and I’d be blown away by the glamour. Tia loved it too and was the natural leader. </p>\n<p>\n“I think the other kids may have seen how much time I spent with Tia and felt a bit jealous. With six kids, there’s always rivalry.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly 15-year-old Josh has opted to stay out of the spotlight, though he helps by babysitting during pageant season, from March to October. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne is behind all of her kids when it comes to their pageant careers, but she insists she is realistic. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “We want to let them all dip their toe in and try it but I know it’s not for everyone.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAll the same, she wouldn’t want to see the kids quit on a whim — especially Tia, who has had a flush of wins. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “We’d never force her to do anything she didn’t want. But we’d be reluctant to let her just walk away. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s so good and we’ve invested so much. </p>\n<p>\n“Although it’s not all about the winning, it’s a lot of money to spend if you don’t succeed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne dismisses the objections that are often levelled at pageants, insisting the outlandish outfits and make-up are harmless dressing up. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: “Kids wear less during the summer holidays on the streets in Blackpool. </p>\n<p>\n“Strangers aren’t going to walk off the street and see my kids in a swimsuit, because all the events are ticketed. </p>\n<p>\n“And not every competition is full glitz. They’ve all done great in natural pageants too.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Woodalls intend to keep following their pageant dream for as long as they can. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “I am so excited waiting for pageant season to get into full swing. </p>\n<p>\n“We’ll all be spending loads of time together doing what we love most.”\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By Dr LINDA PAPADOPOULOS, </b>Psychologist </p>\n<p>\nTHE notion of little girls enjoying dressing up is nothing new and there is nothing wrong with them role-playing. </p>\n<p>\nWhat is concerning is that in competitions such as these, they are encouraged to experiment with themes they may not be ready to deal with. </p>\n<p>\nThese girls are being judged on their appearance. They are aware that to succeed they not only need to act a certain way but to look a certain way. </p>\n<p>\nThis is an unhealthy and potentially dangerous message. </p>\n<p>\nWe also need to consider the impact of wearing clothes that are designed to highlight sexual characteristics they do not yet possess. </p>\n<p>\nJudging girls on how they look devalues them and teaches them to base their self-worth on being appealing to others.

Then the pet owners give their verdicts. </p>\n<h1>\nAries<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>March 21 - April 20 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLONG-HAIRED chihuahua Bo-Duppy is five years old and an Aries. His owner, teaching assistant Amy Barratt-Singh, 25, from Birmingham, is a Scorpio. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “This confident and brave canine aims to protect and guard his family. From a young age you have been able to see early signs of his assertive, leadership potential. Sometimes this can come across to others as aggressive in style. </p>\n<p>\n“He is energetic and at times may well believe that he’s in charge. </p>\n<p>\n“There may be a power struggle between the signs of owner Amy and Bo-Duppy.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmy says: “Bo-Duppy is certainly confident and brave. He is protective to the extreme and when we are in the street he will not let a stranger come anywhere near me. </p>\n<p>\n“He definitely shows leadership potential. He rules the roost in my house.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nTaurus<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>April 21 - May 21 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLABRADOR Tumble, two, is a Taurus. He is owned by five-year-old Ben Watkins, from Tamworth, Staffs, who is a Libra. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “His pup tends to have a calm attitude. He adores meal times but it has to be the leanest, finest and tastiest food available. </p>\n<p>\n“Watch his weight, you don’t want his beautiful appearance spoilt. </p>\n<p>\n“A Libra and Taurus relationship should work very well as both signs are ruled by the planet of love.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBen says: “Tumble is very greedy, so we do have to watch that he doesn’t eat too much dog food, otherwise he will get fat. </p>\n<p>\n“He can get a bit excitable but normally he is quite calm and lets me lie and play on him. Really he is my best friend in the whole world.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nGemini<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>May 22 - June 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDAVE is nine months old, a miniature schnauzer and is a Gemini. He lives with Taurus nail technician Zoe Pocock, 36, in Borough, South London. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “This canine loves accompanying you everywhere and finding out what everyone’s been up to. </p>\n<p>\n“He can move like lightning, is extremely bright and adores learning new tricks. His quick mind can’t bear to be bored, so don’t leave him alone for long if you value your home. The only problem between owner and pet will be Dave does not need to eat as much as Zoe thinks he does.”\n</p>\n<p>\nZoe says: “Dave sleeps in his own bed and loves cuddles with his mum. He loves biting and stealing people’s slippers and shoes.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nCancer<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>June 22 - July 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBORDER terrier Dotty, eight, is a Cancer. Dental hygienist owner Alison Seymour, 47, is an Aquarius and lives in Winchester, Hants. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “Dotty, the Cancerian canine, probably tends to be a home-bird. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is sensitive, caring – and an excellent addition to the family. </p>\n<p>\n“Soft and gentle on the inside but she can present a rather crusty outer shell to the world. An Aquarius owner will love observing the personality of a Cancerian pet – they will get on well.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison says: “This sums Dotty up. She is very home-loving and is always a bit unsure when we’re away on holiday.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLeo<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>July 23 - August 23 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nGERMAN shepherd Sky is two and a Leo. She lives in Shenfield, Essex, with mum-of-four Shelley Hutchins, 39, who was born on the cusp of Gemini and Taurus. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “This canine is loyal with a loving heart. She needs to shine and be treated like the queen she is. </p>\n<p>\n“Grooming procedures will give her the feeling of being adored. </p>\n<p>\n“Never ever scold, her loving heart simply couldn’t bear it. </p>\n<p>\n“Things between owner and pet should work well as long as Sky gets lavished with praise.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShelley says: “This is very true, Sky is loving, loyal and trusting but sometimes thinks her way is the right way and doesn’t listen.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nVirgo<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>August 24 - September 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBRITISH Blue cat Martha, two, is a Virgo. Her owner, Sun beauty writer Lauren Naylor, 31, lives in Wapping, East London, and is a Leo. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “Do make sure Martha’s bed and bowls are spotless as she’s a stickler for cleanliness. She can be a bit of a fussy eater too. </p>\n<p>\n“She thrives on predictability and routine. This is why Virgo dogs really are ideal candidates for training as a helper for the disabled. </p>\n<p>\n“A Virgo pet and Leo owner work well together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLauren says: “This is very accurate. My dad, David, is disabled and she loves to sleep near him in his wheelchair or keep a watchful eye over him from the stairs.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLibra<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>September 23 - October 23 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCROSS-BREED Sophie, six, is a Libra. Owner Alexandra Newbury, 30, is a service adviser from Tamworth, Staffs and is a Capricorn. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “The Libra canine thrives in the company of a significant other and your relationship will be very special. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s well-mannered, so you can take her anywhere. </p>\n<p>\n“Balance and fairness are important to her, and she’ll expect the same high standards as you when it comes to dining and sleeping in a comfy bed. </p>\n<p>\n“Owner and pet will work well together as long as they spend a lot of time together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlexandra says: “That is actually freaky as it describes her so well. She expects to sleep on my bed and always wants what I’m eating for tea. She is well mannered, gentle and calm. </p>\n<p>\n“You can take her anywhere. Our picture was taken in the pub where she charmed everyone.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nScorpio<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>October 24 - November 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLABRADOR Barney, three, is a Scorpio. He lives with Cancerian office worker Maggie Morgan, 42, in Hamble, Hants. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “The Scorpio canine tends to be suspicious by nature and terribly nosy which makes him an excellent choice as an airport sniffer dog. Your relationship is likely to be intense, as he may not be happy to share you. </p>\n<p>\n“He sometimes likes to hide things so you may one day stumble upon hidden treasures that perhaps you thought were lost. </p>\n<p>\n“In the stars, owner and pet are a good mix because both appreciate closeness.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMaggie says: “On every walk, Barney has his nose to the ground, sniffing out who has been out and about on his patch. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m sure he’d be an excellent sniffer dog if he’d been properly trained. </p>\n<p>\n“Only he knows where he keeps his stash of my socks and gloves.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nSagittarius<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>November 23 - December 21 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMOGGY Forbes, four, is a Sagittarius. He is owned by Sun Woman acting deputy editor Dulcie Pearce, 30, a Virgo from West London. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “Forbes needs freedom to explore and create new experiences. </p>\n<p>\n“He has a real thirst for adventure and would excel at expeditions. </p>\n<p>\n“If he does get bored during the day, his sleeping pattern at night may become disturbed. </p>\n<p>\n“Owner and pet may experience a little friction if the adventurous pet makes too much mess for his super-clean Virgo owner.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDulcie says: “Forbes is a true Sagittarius. His sleep patterns differ on a nightly basis and he will often be awake all night if he is bored in the day. </p>\n<p>\n“He also likes nothing more than to go on an adventure – usually to stay at my parents’ house when I go on holiday.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nCapricorn<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>December 22 - January 20 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBLACK and white puss Freddie, six, is a Capricorn and lives with Libran teacher James Burrows, 32, in Colchester, Essex. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “The Capricorn pet takes life very seriously. He seems wise beyond his years. </p>\n<p>\n“He’ll enjoy showing you just how hard he can work and plod on until he gets it right. </p>\n<p>\n“This is a good combination of pet and owner as Freddie will feel very settled.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJames says: “Freddie is a very clever cat and loves to show this off. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s forever catching birds and mice, and loves to bring them to me and show me what he has achieved.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAquarius<b><br></br></b> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>January 21 - February 18 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCROSS-BREED pooch Ralph, two, is an Aquarius – just like writer owner Sally Windsor, 32, of Crawley, Sussex. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “An Aquarian canine is special and highly intelligent. He’s a one-off, blessed with an optimistic outlook. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s very interested in others and always makes them feel welcome. </p>\n<p>\n“His favourite activity is to run with a pack of canine friends. </p>\n<p>\n“Horoscope-wise owner and pet are a good combination.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSally says: “Ralph is always trying to make new friends in the park, so he’s a typical Aquarius. </p>\n<p>\n“He doesn’t like sticking to the rules – a bit like me – so the two of us are always getting into trouble together.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>Pisces<br></br> </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>February 19 - March 20 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nJACK Russell Porky, three, is a Pisces. Owner Alison Webster, 49, is a photographer from Kent and is a Gemini. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “Awake or sleeping the Pisces animal just adores being near you. </p>\n<p>\n“When she sleeps she may need some encouragement to rise from her slumbers, but once she is out she’ll enjoy herself with you by his side. She offers unconditional love. </p>\n<p>\n“The star signs of owner and pet work, if the owner takes the pet everywhere.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison says: “Porky loves being around people as she’s very affectionate and gets jealous if I give others dogs too much attention. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s very lazy – forever dozing when the rest of the house is up and about.”\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Expert ...

Doing as little as four minutes – or one “HIT” – can be better for you than an hour’s slog. </p>\n<p>\nThe four-minute, high-intensity training session can increase your aerobic and anaerobic capacity and speed up the metabolism, helping you burn more fat and make you look 200 per cent leaner than a traditional 60-minute aerobic workout. </p>\n<p>\nKnown as the closest thing we have to a fitness miracle, the HIT workout is loved by researchers and fitness pros alike for its fat-torching abilities and simplicity. </p>\n<p>\nCeleb fans include Jessica Biel and Cameron Diaz. </p>\n<p>\nHIT workouts are not easy, but are appealing to time-starved mums, working women and anyone juggling a hectic life. </p>\n<p>\nSun fitness expert Nicki Waterman says: “My advice is to combine your plan with 30 minutes of aerobic exercise like fast walking, jogging, swimming, cycling or dancing, for example, to get the maximum effect. </p>\n<p>\n“To do a HIT, simply pick an exercise and set a timer for 20 seconds on and ten seconds rest. </p>\n<p>\n“Do the exercise as hard as you possibly can for 20 seconds and then rest for ten, repeating eight to 20 times in total. And remember, you have to work to 100 per cent maximum intensity. By the end of the four minutes you should feel like you’ve done a full workout and have nothing else to give.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out my favourites to get you started for one week. </p>\n<p>\nBut please check with your doctor before starting this exercise programme. And always warm up and cool down for at least five minutes before and after each HIT session. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MONDAY:</b> <b>Skipping</b> </p>\n<p>\nCARDIO and coordination all in one. Take a skipping rope and jump as fast as you can, using whichever foot pattern you like. </p>\n<p>\nOptions include both feet together, high knees, the “boxer shuffle” with heels in front, alternating feet, and butt-kickers. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Make sure your rope is long enough before you start – nothing ruins a good HIT workout like getting whipped across your calves. </p>\n<p>\nTo check for proper length, stand in the centre of your rope and pull the handles straight up. They should come at least as high as your armpits. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TUESDAY:</b> <b>Jumping Lunges</b> </p>\n<p>\nYou already know and love (to hate?) lunges for their butt-blasting ability. Add a jump in between alternating legs to up the difficulty and cardio factor. </p>\n<p>\nStart by stepping your right foot forward into a deep lunge, until your leg is parallel with the ground. Then jump, bringing your back (left) foot forward and landing in a lunge. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> You can step through each lunge if jumping gets too hard. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDNESDAY:</b> <b>Box Jumps</b> </p>\n<p>\nFind a weight bench, or a step that hits somewhere between your shins and your knees. </p>\n<p>\nStand in front of it and jump on top of the bench/step with both feet together. </p>\n<p>\nJump back to the floor, again with both feet together. Try not to rest when you land and jump right back up again. </p>\n<p>\nIf this is too difficult, you can do step-ups onto the box instead. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THURSDAY:</b> <b>Mountain Climbers</b> </p>\n<p>\nMake a triangle with your hands and feet on the floor with your butt up in the air. Bring one leg towards your chest. Keeping hands on the ground, jump to switch your legs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Just quickly touch each toe down so you’re not resting by putting whole foot down. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>FRIDAY:</b> <b>Hindu Squats</b> </p>\n<p>\nThese are similar to a traditional squat but instead of stopping when your thighs are parallel to the ground, you continue down, dropping your butt towards your heels until your fingertips brush the ground. </p>\n<p>\nGoing through the full range of motion gets your heart rate up faster and engages more muscles. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Don’t be afraid – contrary to popular belief, researchers now say that for healthy people, squatting to the ground won’t hurt your knees. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SATURDAY: Bicycle Sprints</b> </p>\n<p>\nBikes are perfect for engaging your whole lower body and really getting your heart rate up for those 20 seconds. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> It’s a little easier to time and to rest on a stationary bike – you can just take your feet off the pedals for ten seconds rather than trying to start and stop/coast on the road. </p>\n<p>\nThe HIT diet plan </p>\n<p>\n<b>SUN nutritionist Amanda Ursell says:</b> “If your aim is to lose weight, then you need to combine your workout with a style of eating that provides energy to exercise, yet cuts empty calories that are keeping your body mass index high. </p>\n<p>\n“Timing of your meals and snacks is especially important because your body needs fuel to cope with the HIT workout before you start and, once you have finished, to allow your muscles to recover and be ready for the next hard session. </p>\n<p>\n“Here’s how to eat to lose weight but keep your body healthy and able to cope with the HIT plan over the coming week.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Before you train:</b> Whether you train before breakfast, before lunch or at the end of the day before dinner, have something like a handful of raisins, a banana or even a small smoothie an hour to 30 minutes before you start. </p>\n<p>\n<b>During training:</b> Drink “to thirst”. This simply means have a drink when you feel the need and stop once you no longer feel thirsty. </p>\n<p>\n<b>After training:</b> Have your meal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner within half an hour of finishing. If you can’t manage this, have another small snack like some dried fruit or a cereal bar. </p>\n<p>\n<b>YOUR DAILY DIET</b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Breakfast:</b> This is not the week to skip breakfast, however rushed your daily schedule. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are training early, have breakfast once you have finished. If not, make time to have it before you leave the house. </p>\n<p>\nHave a breakfast of porridge made with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk with some dried fruit such as chopped apricots; a wholegrain cereal such as Oatibix or Weetabix or a fruit salad which includes a banana with some zero per cent fat Total Greek yoghurt and a handful of sunflower seeds. </p>\n<p>\nAlternatively, have two poached or boiled eggs with two pieces of toast and a glass of orange or apple juice. </p>\n<p>\nHave a glass of water and your usual cup of tea or coffee using skimmed milk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-morning:</b> Have a handful of nuts such as almonds, cashews, pistachios or Brazil nuts with an apple, orange or a pear and a glass of water. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lunch:</b> Build your lunch around an average-sized portion of carbohydrate foods that give you a steady supply of energy. These include pitta breads, tortilla wraps, bread, pasta, noodles, or a baked potato. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich food such as tuna, chicken, turkey, lean slices of roast beef, hard-boiled eggs, prawns, cottage or ricotta cheese, pulses such as baked beans, peas or lentils, tofu or Quorn products. </p>\n<p>\nHave some veg with these such as tomato and cucumber in a sandwich, lettuce and spring onions in a wrap or pitta or salad with a baked potato and baked beans. Always have some water with your lunch. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-afternoon:</b> A couple of oat cakes with some cottage or ricotta cheese and berries; a slice of peanut butter on toast; an apple with a small matchbox-size piece of reduced-fat Cheddar or a handful of mixed nuts and raisins. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dinner:</b> As with lunchtime, dinner needs to be a mix of an average-size serving of carbohydrate-based foods such as new boiled potatoes, pasta, rice or noodles. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich foods such as lean red meat – lean mince, a lean pork chop or lean roast lamb; Turkey, chicken or ham; grilled, baked or canned fish; tofu, Quorn mince or “chicken” pieces, pulses such as baked beans. </p>\n<p>\nAlso add some vegetables. Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, green beans, sweetcorn, tomatoes, onions – whichever you enjoy and find easy to prepare. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Fan ...

She was strict, but wanted a daughter who could look after herself. </p>\n<p>\nI was not the easiest of girls to bring up. From very young I seemed to know what I wanted to do in life — singing, dancing, acting. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant my mum had to drive for miles to take me to various classes. She was always encouraging about self-improvement. </p>\n<p>\nShe took me to auditions in Los Angeles, which was on the other side of the country from where we lived in Florida. </p>\n<p>\nI was born in Oak Ridge, a small town in Tennessee, but was brought up mostly in St Petersburg, Florida, after my mother remarried. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she and Dad were together, they did not have much money. But I was happy as a kid. </p>\n<p>\nIt made me realise you don’t have to be rich to be happy. My dad used to hunt ducks and my mum would put them in the pot. We lived modestly. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum says I was born really ballsy. She’s put up with it very well. </p>\n<p>\nI attended a Pentecostal church and then a Christian school. I had to obey strict rules at school and at home. I was grounded a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI got a diploma from a correspondence programme. It was the deal I made with my mum. I had to have a real diploma before she would allow me to drop out of Christian school and move to Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some struggles along the way, which my mum has seen me through. I am also not the easiest of people to be friends with. </p>\n<p>\nI think it is my fault. I work away from home and have learned to be on my own. </p>\n<p>\nI don’t socialise much on a film set and don’t have to become best friends with the people I work with. </p>\n<p>\nThere is a saying in Hollywood that what happens on a film set stays on a film set. But if I’d ever dated a co-star, it would have been downright depressing. Most actors would not appeal to most women, if they actually met them. </p>\n<p>\nI met Brian when I was 18. I was too young to remember his show, Beverly Hills 90210, so I didn’t know who he was. But I knew I was instantly in love. </p>\n<p>\nThere is no secret to being a sex symbol. I play the game, that’s all. </p>\n<p>\nIf people want to think of me as wild and crazy, that’s up to them. The fact is, I’ve only had two serious boyfriends in my life — and I married one. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI have the same hang-ups as any other girl. Am I too fat? Too thin? Do I wear the right clothes? You think about it so much, it can hurt how you live. </p>\n<p>\nSo am I insecure? God, yes. Show me a woman who says she’s totally secure about everything in her life and I will show you a pain in the ass. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some bad moments along the way, during which calls to my mum have meant a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI lived in New York, doing TV comedy Hope & Faith, and it was cold and miserable. </p>\n<p>\nI was either at work or home in a little apartment, on my own. I let whole days slip by, doing nothing. </p>\n<p>\nI am confident in how I project myself but not in terms of how I look. It all came to a head when I was making 2008 film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People in London. </p>\n<p>\nThere was one scene in which I danced around in lingerie. I suddenly felt like I couldn’t do the scene and asked if I could wear a skirt. </p>\n<p>\nThe director, quite rightly, said it would look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nBut I was not happy. It ended up with the producer serving me a beer before the scene. I was tired from working non-stop on several films, was suffering from jet lag on the trip to England and started to worry about my ability. </p>\n<p>\nThat’s where Mum comes in. I called her a few times from London and she was able to calm me down and encourage me. </p>\n<p>\nI am still her little girl, whatever way you want to look at it. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"'Mum says I was born ballsy' ... actress Megan Fox","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02FOXX_1482370a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02MEG2-_1482371a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"Is Megan Fox expecting a baby?","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4225465/Is-Megan-Fox-expecting-a-baby.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"The Dictator will rule screens this Spring","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4225048/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-stars-in-new-trailer-to-The-Dictator.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Megan Fox serves up a tasty treat in new advert","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4192011/Megan-Fox-serves-up-a-tasty-treat-in-new-advert.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Megan's the face of an Angel in latest shoot","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4164565/Megan-Fox-is-the-face-of-an-Angel-in-latest-shoot.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"My tattoos are a Meg-a mistake","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4160020/Megan-Fox-tattoo-Star-is-having-her-Marilyn-Monroe-inking-lasered-off.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":{"#":"Megan Fox is back in her bikini"},"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4145794/Megan-Fox-looks-hot-in-her-bikini-in-Kona-Hawaii.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7d6efdac2473db2f000067"},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Fashion tribe ... be bold with bright shades","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30WOM6--_1480589a.jpg","section":"woman","headline":"Mex 'n' match","teaser":"AS fashion goes Aztec with graphic prints and bold colours, we show you how to get the look on High Street","byline":"By SASKIA QUIRKE","timestamp":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nTRIBAL fashion is taking over this season, with the bold look top of the trends. </p>\n<p>\nStyle warriors will love the hot colour combinations and mixed-up graphic print clashes inspired by old Mexico. </p>\n<p>\nMust-have labels Burberry Prorsum and Peter Pilotto showcased the look on their catwalks and now savvy stores such as Asos and Topshop are cashing in on it. </p>\n<p>\nAccessories are key – think raffia, beading and ethnic prints, with brands such as Evans going all-out with colourful woven bracelets and necklaces. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Here <b>SASKIA QUIRKE</b> takes a closer look at the trend that’s straight out of Mexico’s Aztec past and on to the High Street. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MAIN IMAGE LEFT:</b> Dress, £20, very.co.uk</a>; lime skirt, £35, and wedges, £75, both Topshop; earrings, £12, Freedom at Topshop </p>\n<p>\n<b>MAIN IMAGE CENTRE:</b> Coat, £99.99, Zara; tribal dress, £13, Primark; earrings, £12, Freedom at Topshop </p>\n<p>\n<b>MAIN IMAGE RIGHT:</b> Jumper, £28, Littlewoods; leopard print top (worn underneath), £20, River Island; shorts, £28, Topshop; shoes, £80, Aldo; ring, £20, Freedom at Topshop </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>LEFT:</b> Jacket, £150, Topshop Boutique; vest, £5, Primark; trousers, £40, Topshop </p>\n<p>\n<b>RIGHT:</b> Black top, £80, Topshop; neon print skirt, £40, Topshop </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Fashion tribe ... be bold with bright shades","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30WOM6--_1480589a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30WOM1--_1480590a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"How to dress like Alesha Dixon","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4223537/Top-stylist-on-Alesha-Dixons-make-over.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":{"#":"What your clothes say about YOU"},"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4221210/What-sense-of-style-says-about-YOU.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Which push-up is bust?","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4218830/Which-push-up-bra-is-best.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"I see your trew colours","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4217083/Star-style-steal-I-see-your-trew-colours.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Go bananas for a tasty new trend","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4232005/Go-bananas-for-a-tasty-new-trend.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7d6efdac2473db2f000068"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Quirky ...

But those illusions were quickly shattered by a Benfica team who clearly believed this tie was very much alive. </p>\n<p>\nThe Portuguese giants arrived at Stamford Bridge determined to snatch an early away goal to cancel out Chelsea’s first-leg advantage. </p>\n<p>\nAnd they might have claimed it but for Lampard’s crucial block to keep out Axel Witsel’s shot from the edge of the area. </p>\n<p>\nEven though Benfica had been handicapped by the absence of a single fit centre-half, Chelsea were finding it difficult to break out of their own half to test their visitors’ defensive problems. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately for Benfica, when Chelsea did get at stand-in stopper Javi Garcia, the Spaniard’s limitations were ruthlessly exposed. </p>\n<p>\nTerry’s long ball was allowed to bounce in the box and, as Ashley Cole moved in to make his challenge, he was barged over by Garcia. </p>\n<p>\nSlovenian ref Damir Skomina pointed immediately to the spot and though goalkeeper Artur got a strong hand to Lampard’s 21st-minute penalty, it was not enough to keep the ball out of his net. </p>\n<p>\nChelsea now had the breathing space they required yet were still not out of the woods as Terry was forced to clear off his line from Oscar Cardozo. </p>\n<p>\nThey were hardly helped by their inability to keep the ball and a dangerous habit of conceding free-kicks in their half, shortcomings which will need to be addressed before Barcelona come calling in two weeks’ time. </p>\n<p>\nBut any thoughts of a Benfica comeback were torpedoed with the dismissal of right-back Maxi Pereira five minutes before half-time. </p>\n<p>\nThe Uruguayan defender had already been booked for disputing Chelsea’s penalty when he caught John Obi Mikel with a careless lunge which was met with a second yellow card from ref Skomina. </p>\n<p>\nYet still Benfica refused to accept their fate as Cardozo tested the reflexes of Petr Cech shortly after the break. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nChelsea’s numerical advantage, though, was beginning to take its toll and Salomon Kalou almost added to his first-leg goal when his shot struck the far post. </p>\n<p>\nFernando Torres had a low effort deflected wide by Garcia and then failed to hit the target with a volley after Artur could only parry Juan Mata’s fierce shot. </p>\n<p>\nKalou was next to be denied by the Benfica keeper and he then fired narrowly wide after swivelling on to Cole’s inviting low cross into the danger area. </p>\n<p>\nDi Matteo was becoming increasingly frustrated by his team’s failure to put this tie beyond doubt. </p>\n<p>\nAnd his concerns were confirmed in the 85th minute when Benfica grabbed the goal that left Chelsea clinging on for dear life. </p>\n<p>\nCech had already defied gravity to claw away a goal-bound header from substitute Yannick Djalo. </p>\n<p>\nBut David Luiz lost Garcia at the resultant corner, leaving the Spaniard unchallenged to glance home a header. Suddenly Chelsea were just one goal away from blowing it and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. </p>\n<p>\nBut with Benfica throwing everyone forward for one last hurrah, substitute Meireles nicked the ball off the head of Witsel and raced half the length of the pitch before unleashing an unstoppable shot beyond keeper Artur. </p>\n<p>\nGame over, Benfica.

But so many have come together and are supporting the two lads.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Basically they are saying ‘We are all in it together’ — and that’s every football team, not just here but around the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We have seen Barcelona players wearing Fabrice T-shirts and Chelsea players wearing ‘Get well Stan’ tops.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I must admit it’s all brought a lump to my throat.”\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly after talking at length about the plight of his fellow pros will Bent address his own 10-week fight for fitness after damaging ankle ligaments at Wigan on February 25.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe striker admitted: “It’s frustrating big-time. It’s the first serious injury of my career and the timing could not be worse. We are coming to crunch time in the season and Villa are fighting for survival.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Of course I want to be out there helping but it doesn’t look like I’ll play again this season.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That means I’ll probably be missing the Euros too, so it’s a big blow.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The time-frame for the injury takes me to May 16 by which time the ankle will be fully healed and my rehab completed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is 10 days before England’s first Euro warm-up game, in Oslo against Norway. And Bent wants to be there.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: “I’d just say to the new England manager, whoever it is, give me a chance.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Then it will be down to whether he does take a chance on me, at least in one of the warm-ups.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut what if the new Three Lions boss is Harry Redknapp?\n</p>\n<p>\nThe manager who infamously said “his missus” could have scored a chance Bent missed for Spurs against Portsmouth in 2009. That cruel barb has dogged the striker ever since — but Bent is a forgiving soul.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “If Harry gets the job then good on him.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Hopefully if I can get back from injury in time he will pick me.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I know people still talk about what he said even now. But I’m not annoyed about it any more.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ve lost count of how many goals I’ve scored since then — I think I scored two against Bolton the very next week.\n</p>\n<p>\n“That’s Harry and he can say what he wants, and managers do make off-the-cuff remarks. But that is one everyone remembers.\n</p>\n<p>\n“You have to take it and move on. It doesn’t bother me now although it bothered me probably more than it should have done at the time. My attitude now is if you score enough goals, that’s the best answer to any criticism.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Bent has a back-up plan if the Euros do come too soon for him.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: “If Euro 2012 doesn’t happen for me I’m definitely up for playing in the Olympic Games.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s a massive event and it doesn’t come to your home town but once in a lifetime. It would be ridiculous to give up the opportunity.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDon’t dismiss the notion. Bent is working hard to be ready, revealing: “These days I am getting around a lot better — I’ve even had the boot off a couple of times.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m doing lots of swimming and I’m getting pretty quick. So if I don’t make the GB football team maybe I can make the swimming team and take on Michael Phelps.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I bet ’Arry’s missus couldn’t do that.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Darren Bent appears in EA SPORTS FIFA Street which is out NOW on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

A side that, in beating Milan 24 hours before Chelsea scraped past Benfica, had reached a fifth successive semi-final, a figure matched only by the Real Madrid of Di Stefano and Puskas in the Fifties. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter that — well, is there an after that? Should there be, by some miracle, it hardly gets much easier. </p>\n<p>\nEither Jose Mourinho’s La Liga leaders Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, Franck Ribery and Chelsea old boy Arjen Robben in their own Allianz Arena. </p>\n<p>\nPick the bones out of that. </p>\n<p>\nCruising at one point last night, Chelsea fell apart once John Terry went off on the hour. Suddenly tentative and unsure, they were run off their feet as Benfica poured down the flanks and into the box. </p>\n<p>\nAnd this by a team reduced to 10 men after 40 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nAnd with a makeshift defence after first-choice central defenders Luisao and Jardel were left nursing injuries back home in Lisbon. </p>\n<p>\nAnd with most of the questions being posed by substitutes Yannick Djalo, Nelson Oliveira and Rodrigo. </p>\n<p>\nIf 10 men — including three subs — can reduce Chelsea to such a state of panic what sort of damage can 11 from Barcelona inflict? Especially down the flanks where Alves must be already licking his lips at the prospect of getting at the Chelsea back four. </p>\n<p>\nAnother of Chelsea’s problems in the final 30 minutes was a glaring inability to control either the ball or the game in midfield. </p>\n<p>\nIf they don’t get it right from the start against Barca, the Xavi-Iniesta-Messi axis will have Frank Lampard and Co chasing shadows. </p>\n<p>\nChelsea also cannot afford to squander the sort of chances that fell to Salomon Kalou (twice) and Fernando Torres after the break. </p>\n<p>\nWith the buffer of a 20th-minute Lampard penalty, Chelsea should have been strolling. But, with Terry off, they were exposed and had it not been for Petr Cech and some poor finishing of their own, Benfica would have equalised long before they did. </p>\n<p>\nWhen they did get the goal they deserved it was due to poor defending by David Luiz and substitute Gary Cahill — both lost by Javi Garcia as he rose to head home. Benfica then might even have won it through Oliveira. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd, yet, where there’s life there’s hope. Certainly, Chelsea deserve a lot of credit for their unlikely revival under Di Matteo, a run that has seen just one defeat in nine games. </p>\n<p>\nEngland’s lone European standard-bearers could hardly have done more at Stamford Bridge in the Champions League. All five games won including the heroic 4-1 dismantling of Napoli after the Italians had established a two-goal lead from the first leg. </p>\n<p>\nAnd yet. And yet. Despite that home form, you worry what might happen in a fortnight’s time when Barcelona come calling. But Barca coach Pep Guardiola will not underestimate Chelsea. On Tuesday he said: “Chelsea may have had problems but their great players are coming good at the right time. It is a team with enormous experience.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd, yes, that experience showed last night as they withstood both early pressure and Benfica intimidation to take the sting out of their opponents. </p>\n<p>\nNerves seemed to have been settled in the 21st minute when Garcia, one of the replacement centre-halves, bundled Ashley Cole over in the box and Lampard drilled his spot-kick under Artur. Then Maxi Pereira, already booked for moaning about the penalty, was sent off after receiving a second yellow for a foul on Jon Obi Mikel just before half-time. </p>\n<p>\nThough Branislav Ivanovic had had to clear off the line, the tie appeared to be swinging Chelsea’s way. </p>\n<p>\nBut those misses by Kalou and Torres gave Benfica the reprieve they needed in which to mount that furious late assault. Chelsea were all over the place. Yes, Meireles scored a miraculous injury-time winner but Chelsea were far from convincing. </p>\n<p>\nAnd now it’s Barcelona. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"BRING ON BARCA ...

But I’d say no.</p>\n<p>“I’m still a fan of his but he doesn’t have that momentum any more. And I know what that’s like. It’s tough to keep working your way back, reinventing your swing and getting over all your injuries.</p>\n<p>“He’ll probably win another two Majors but I don’t think he’ll break Jack’s record.”</p>\n<p>McIlroy was also quick to shoot down the theory this Masters is a two-horse race.</p>\n<p>He said: “You have to remember, there’s 80-plus players in this field. It’s not just about two guys or three guys or whatever.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to be getting all this praise and everything, but you have to take it with a pinch of salt.</p>\n<p>“I’m nowhere near the level Tiger reached. I definitely don’t have the achievements he has, or anything like the amount of success that he’s had over the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully I can one day even get close to that point. But for now I’m just happy to be here and hopefully have a good chance of winning.</p>\n<p>“Mentally, I feel like if I get myself in a winning position again, I’ll be able to approach it a lot better. I felt like I didn’t approach it well at all last year.</p>\n<p>“It was out of character for me, and I now realise I just needed to try and be myself a little bit more.</p>\n<p>“For me, it was trying to be too focused, too perfect. Now I feel like myself, I need to be more relaxed.</p>\n<p>“I sort of naturally have a bounce in my step. Last year I was staring at the ground trying to shut everything out, and I looked hunched and insular.

We just came up against someone playing out of his skin.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Lee’s hitting the ball lovely at the moment so you’ve got to give him a big chance. If fate decided to lend a helping hand that would be nice.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m not particularly superstitious and neither is Lee. But that could change if he slips on the Green Jacket on Sunday.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFoster, 46, is one of the most respected caddies in the game and has carried the bags of some of the greats — including Seve Ballesteros, Darren Clarke and Sergio Garcia.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he even caddied for Tiger Woods at a Presidents Cup when Steve Williams was injured.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: “I’ve caddied for a couple of Major winners in Seve and Darren, but not when they won their Majors.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It’s been a long wait. I’ve been caddying for 30 years now and it’s about time I saw my man win one of the big ones. I’d be thrilled if Lee did it here. He’s been knocking on the door for so long that it’s got to open for him soon.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWestwood, who had Ant ’n Dec as his caddies for yesterday’s par-3 competition, finished on 13-under two years ago — a total that would have won the previous eight Masters.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe shot sub-par rounds all four days but came up against an inspired Mickelson, who hit back-to-back 67s over the weekend to beat him by three shots.\n</p>\n<p>\nWesty, 38, said: “I look back on that as a positive as it proved I can play this course well and break par when the heat’s really on.\n</p>\n<p>\n“It was just a case of Phil playing unbelievable golf. I’ve been close in so many Majors now. I’m sure my time will come.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WESTWOOD'S KILLER HOLES\n</b></p>\n<p>\nHERE’S the hole truth — LEE WESTWOOD gives you the exclusive lowdown on the holes that could make or break his bid to go one better than his 2010 second-place finish at Augusta.<b>\n</b></p>\n<p>\n<b>HOLE 7\n</b></p>\n<p>\nTHIS is such a difficult fairway to hit. Fifteen years ago there was a safe way to play this hole — hit a three-iron off the tee and then a wedge. But it has been lengthened so much there’s no alternative but to use a driver. I hit driver and wedge in practice. Let’s hope I can do that in competition.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>HOLE 11\n</b></p>\n<p>\nTHE start of Amen Corner is a very long hole now. It plays its full 505 yards, particularly when the fairways are soft and there’s no run on the ball. The approach is tough because of the water on the left of the green. It only takes a slight pull to be wet. This is a take-the-par-and-run sort of hole.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>HOLE 14\n</b></p>\n<p>\nIT’S a tricky drive that you just have to sling up there as far as you can. If you get it on the fairway it’s a birdie chance – but if you miss in the wrong spot you’re knackered. I’m talking three yards difference between it being fine and impossible.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"BAG MEN ...
