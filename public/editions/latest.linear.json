Drivers were spotted lining up in Waterlooville, Hants; Slough, Berks and Heathrow Airport. </p>\n<p>\nThe PM's official spokeswoman said: \"It is important that people look at their contingency plans, particularly businesses. Because should there be a dispute  which we want to avoid  then disruption would be inevitable.\" Asked whether her words were irresponsible, she said: \"Currently there are no problems with fuel supplies\". </p>\n<p>\nLabour branded the Government's advice to fill up \"the height of irresponsibility\" if it leads to a rush on reserves and petrol stations run dry. But it emerged last night the risky warning was a tactic to heap pressure on Unite. </p>\n<p>\nMinisters were told that if every motorist in the country fills up their tank, garages will be restocked in time to thwart any strike action. </p>\n<p>\nThe Unite union's 2,000 fuel tanker drivers voted to walk out indefinitely with just seven days' notice in a row about terms and conditions and safety standards. The strike could come as early as Easter. </p>\n<p>\nThe looming stoppage was top of the agenda yesterday at a meeting of the National Security Council. </p>\n<p>\nThe Sun has been campaigning to freeze duty on petrol. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nt.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n999 man 'ignored' </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFIVE desperate calls were made to striking 999 workers before an ambulance was sent to help a dying pensioner, it was revealed yesterday. </p>\n<p>\nThe 83-year-old man died from a heart attack as he was finally being taken to a London hospital during November's public sector pensions walkout. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Build up ...

But yesterday he clashed with Labour MP John Mann during a Treasury Committee hearing on his annual economic blueprint.\n</p>\n<p>\nPressed on whether the \"pasty tax\" was fair, Mr Osborne said: \"If it's cold when you buy it, it will not be VAT-able.\" Mr Mann also asked: \"When was the last time you bought a pasty in Greggs?\" The Chancellor replied: \"I can't remember.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Labour MP told The Sun later: \"It just shows how out of touch Osborne is.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It's obvious he has never been in Greggs so he'll have no idea on the impact this measure will have. Let them eat cold pasties  how heartless. It sounds just like Marie Antoinette.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Sun has launched a \"Who VAT All the Pies\" campaign to demand the Chancellor U-turn before the tax starts on October 1. Hot takeaway food from bakery shops is a staple of ordinary Brits.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne tried to justify his VAT move by saying he was simply imposing a law passed in 1984 decreeing tax should be paid on such grub.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"Since then there has been a lot of legal action to try to get round that. If you buy your pasty in a fish and chip shop, it almost certainly has VAT on it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the Chancellor was hit by a Coalition revolt as three West Country Lib Dem MPs signed a Commons motion calling for the \"humble Cornish pasty\" to be exempt. Greggs were left crestfallen after meeting Treasury minister David Gauke, who insisted there would be no U-turn.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe chain's chief Ken McMeikan said: \"He is insensitive to how hard life is without putting up the price of food.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMr McMeikan produced a letter from ex-Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who appeared to contradict Mr Osborne's assertion by declaring in 1984 that VAT should <b>NOT</b> apply to freshly-baked savouries.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe boss said: \"The point is that these are freshly-baked products that are cooling down, not remaining heated. They just don't get it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Osborne did offer one ray of hope for taxpayers by telling MPs he was bringing in a new form of Treasury accounting.

I just cried and cried. </p>\n<p>\n\"It makes me worry that one day my little boy might see it and be ashamed of me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I feel so sorry for Tulisa. Doesn't the person leaking it realise doing things like this causes heartache and despair?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Debbie was 19 she met a man called Andy who was ten years older than her. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"He was very confident and very sure of himself. He didn't really have any inhibitions whereas I did, so I kind of looked up to him. </p>\n<p>\n\"We had a sexual relationship. It was good but he was quite experimental in the bedroom. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'd let him take naked pictures and films as I just saw it as something that turned him on. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He filmed me about half a dozen times that I knew of and about two or three times where I was unaware the camera was on. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was all on a hand-held camera. Sometimes he held it, other times he mounted it on a tripod. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sex played quite a big part but he took me out for meals and we went drinking. We were a normal couple, apart from there was a bit more sex than usual. </p>\n<p>\n\"Over time he became a little bit too overbearing and dominant. </p>\n<p>\n\"He wanted me to do things I wasn't comfortable doing and go to places I didn't want to go, like swingers clubs. That's when I called it a day. </p>\n<p>\n\"We were together for about five months. I chatted with him on the phone after the split and then after a few weeks I heard nothing from him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA few months later Debbie checked her emails and there was one from a man trying to book an escort. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I sent him an email telling him he had the wrong address and never to email me again. </p>\n<p>\n\"He was adamant it was the right address and replied saying, 'Is this Raquel?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He gave me the name of an agency that he'd booked \"Raquel\" through. </p>\n<p>\n\"I found the website and under the name Raquel were photos and videos my ex had taken  of me. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's hard to describe that moment  it was like a shot of ice had run through my body. </p>\n<p>\n\"I went into shock and began to cry. It was horrible knowing my most intimate moments, shared with my then boyfriend, were on the internet for everyone to see. </p>\n<p>\n\"People only had to go on the internet to see them and it made me feel sick. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There was nobody I felt I could tell at the time. I was only a teenager and felt really embarrassed. I told a couple of my closest girlfriends who I could trust about this but only years later. </p>\n<p>\n\"I kept it a secret for the rest of the time because I felt ashamed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt so vulnerable and paranoid. I didn't know if friends or boys I knew had seen it. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've since realised I had nothing to be ashamed of. He should be the one hanging his head in shame for doing what he did.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDebbie got in touch with a solicitor but there was nothing he could do. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"He told me he was powerless to help because the tapes and photographs are the ex's personal property and if he wants to put them on the internet, he can. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was devastated. When I phoned Andy I couldn't get through, and on the three occasions I went round to his house there was no answer. </p>\n<p>\n\"I pushed a note through his letterbox begging him to take the pictures and videos down but I got no reply. Eventually, he moved  but I don't know where. </p>\n<p>\n\"In the end I had to accept there was nothing I could do and I got on with my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"I presumed they'd eventually get lost in the internet or the site would be taken down. Over time I forgot about them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTwo years later when Debbie met Dave, she thought the horror was behind her. After six years together, she gave birth to their son and life was complete. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a year ago Debbie's nightmare came back to haunt her. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Dave came home in a foul mood. He'd been out with his pals having a few drinks and told me everyone had been talking about me. I joked that I hoped it was all good but he wasn't laughing. </p>\n<p>\n\"He picked up our iPad and found the escort site. I recognised it instantly and my heart jumped. My pictures were underneath the name of an escort. </p>\n<p>\n\"He looked me in the eye and asked, 'So you've been escorting on the side?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I sobbed that I hadn't but before I could carry on he said, 'One of the lads down the pub found this. They were all ogling your pictures.

It's incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n\"<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I'd try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n\"For breakfast, I'd have four slices of toast. For lunch I'd make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n\"Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I'd never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n\"Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: \"I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn't dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n\"So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges  you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n\"Worth more than &#163;3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class  purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n\"So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I'd done. It was the motivation I needed to carry on,\" she says. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Comparing myself month by month stunned me. My face was thinner and I could notice the difference in my waistline and arms.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I began looking forward to each month when the time came to take a picture and compare myself to the previous one.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola also joined a gym and began working out twice a week. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"After the first year I'd lost five stone  down from 24st to 19st. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My meals changed completely to consist of a piece of toast for breakfast, a sandwich with two pieces of brown bread for lunch, fruit for a snack and meat with vegetables for dinner. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking at myself filled me with pride and the compliments I was receiving from friends and family were incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was determined this wasn't going to just be a fad diet phase  this was a new lifestyle for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the next three years she lost a further six stone, dropping to 13st 2lb. </p>\n<p>\nNicola says: \"Every woman wants to look their best in a photo. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I was ever tempted to have a take-away binge at the end of the month, I'd think about having my picture taken and it would put me off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd for shoe-mad Nicola there was only one way to mark her sensational new figure. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In January this year I splashed out on a beautiful pair of &#163;380 cream Jimmy Choo shoes to celebrate.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4210484/Ive-tried-61-different-diets-since-I-was-13.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Why we're all tee totally happy"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4201637/My-8-year-takeaway-binge-cost-25kand-my-unborn-babys-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My 8-year takeaway binge cost £25k...and my unborn baby's life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I'm proud to be UK average size 16.

Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

Try <b>Origins Never A Dull Moment</b> skin-brightening polisher with fruit extracts to help reveal a healthy glow, &#163;24 <i>(Origins)</i>. </p>\n<p>\nPut your feet up and slather on <b>Elemis Papaya Enzyme Peel</b>, &#163;28.60 <i>(Elemis counters)</i>.

You can layer under make-up or wear stand-alone. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are going out and want to appear more made up, try adding highlighter along the cheekbones, down the bridge of the nose and on the forehead  this gives a shimmering dewiness. </p>\n<p>\nYou can also place highlighter on the brow bone and under the arch of the brow to make your eyes appear brighter. </p>\n<p>\n<b>L'Oreal Lumi Magique Concealer</b>, &#163;8.49, <i>(Boots)</i> will help to brighten the eyes if you dab a small amount in the darkest areas, ie, underneath, and <b>Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer</b> in Chestnut, &#163;17, is great for darker skins.

I don't remember her ever saying, \"Wouldn't you be pretty if you did this or that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe never focused on anything beyond wanting me to be presentable  just well-groomed.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe wanted me to take care of myself and be healthy. </p>\n<p>\nShe did ask one or two questions when I became a cheerleader at high school because I would be teasing my hair and wearing lipstick and eyeliner. </p>\n<p>\nI have an affiliation with a lot of countries. My mum was from Norway, my dad from Switzerland and my grandmother was Finnish, I have an Italian uncle, my first love was from South Africa and I was born in Texas.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am definitely a Texan girl. It is a culture you really love in a Latin sort of way. You taste it and hear it and the climate is hot  Texas hot.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI felt lucky that my parents were European  different  and opened the doors to let me see America is not the centre of the universe. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant that, with Bridget Jones, I could go to London and enjoy all things English that make the country so wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the making of the first film, I was even whistling songs by the Spice Girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my mum was a realist about bringing up a teenage girl in America and kept a sense of humour. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me that there are consequences for the things you say and do. She wanted me to grow up to be a good person. She and Dad liked simple and quiet. We had a very quiet house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mum didn't talk about her childhood growing up in Norway during the Second World War. Her sisters talked but all had difficulty in putting into words what they had seen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey told about women giving birth in tunnels because there was no safe haven in any other structure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd about being lost from family members and not being sure if they were alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it was different for me, from my friends, growing up in a house where your mother was grateful just to have peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was one thing which was never acceptable, though.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I said: \"I don't know how to do that\", she would say: \"Learn.\" </p>\n<p>\nShe encouraged me to get a college education (Renee has an English degree) as something to fall back on if acting didn't work out.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved to Los Angeles on December 6, 1993, to be exact.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy attitude was that I was going to see where it took me.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been working in Texas from the age of 21, and been in a couple of films. But I had pretty well exhausted my learning opportunities. </p>\n<p>\nSo I took a grungy little one-bed apartment and was scared to death of the future. It was a leap of faith, I guess. </p>\n<p>\nI had some friends in LA who I had met on films but inside and emotionally, I felt alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make a living, I worked in a bar called The Three Cubs on a street called Vine, behind the Mobil gas station.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was an incredible place for a girl like me, who had lived in relatively safe places all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were crack deals being done on the street corners  so I would come back from the bar late at night then not be able to get out of my car to my apartment until the deals were completed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked at the bar for two years. That was why Mum's guidance was so important and I stayed happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you can take care of yourself and see your friends, that is all that matters. </p>\n<p>\nThe main difference that the film Jerry Maguire made in my life was I could pay my rent and didn't have to waitress any more. It gave me freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew from the start that if I failed in acting, I always had my degree and could try a million things. I was not a \"look at me\" kind of girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had gravitated toward acting because I had a vivid imagination and daydreamed a lot. </p>\n<p>\nBut I did not daydream about being on a film set, winning an Oscar or having people know my name.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for the fact my mum never worried that I would compromise myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was always telling me, 'You don't sit down enough'  but she learned to trust my instincts.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/3927676/Jerry-Maguire-actors-grown-up-to-be-a-big-star.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jerry Maguire actor's grown up to be a big star"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01473/Renee_Zellweger--5_1473337a.jpg","caption":"Different perspective ...

That set me on the road of starvation for a few years.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow the singer, whose 22-date comeback tour with Steps</a> starts on April 2, refuses to bow to that sort of pressure. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I have spent so many years starving myself to be skinny. You can damage yourself by doing that  and I probably have in some ways. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think it's really sad that there is so much emphasis on a woman's size, certainly in the music industry. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not really fair, and it doesn't make your average woman feel that great about herself. It makes you feel low. </p>\n<p>\n\"You are being told by magazines that you shouldn't look like that, you should be skinny  and that's just not the way it is. </p>\n<p>\n\"Being a size 16 doesn't mean you don't look good. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You are brainwashed into thinking you can't wear nice clothes because you are a little bigger and you have to wear baggy stuff to hide whatever's going on underneath  and it's rubbish. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a size 14 to 16 and I have a waist</a>, I have boobs and I have a bum. I can accentuate those assets and still wear a nice dress and feel good about myself. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is important to remember that a size 16 is the average size of a woman in the UK. It is odd how these women are made to feel like they are not the norm but they are.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the height of her fame with Steps Claire starved herself to a size eight before becoming a size 20 when the band split </a>in 2001. Her weight has fluctuated ever since. </p>\n<p>\nShe said of the latest criticism: \"The stories circulating about me struggling with dance moves are complete rubbish. </p>\n<p>\n\"I don't know where that has come from. Maybe someone has thought, 'Oh, she's bigger than the others so she must be struggling'. It's not an issue. It is just one of those things. People have just got to be nasty sometimes. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am putting in as much work and effort as everybody else. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is tough  it's a two-hour show, dancing for pretty much the whole thing. Just because I am a bigger size, I am no less fit than anybody else. It's cr*p. </p>\n<p>\n\"You can run every day and be fit and then be put in the situation that we are all in and you are using muscles you didn't even know you had. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not as simple as someone being fit and someone not being fit  or someone being a size 16 and someone being a size 8. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's all going well. I don't know if it's because I'm a bit older now but I seem to be much more focused and picking up choreography better than I ever did. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not a trained dancer so that was always something I struggled with. Now we are just making sure it all looks perfect. I am in the middle of rehearsals at the moment, so it is a bit manic but really good.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClaire admits the interest in her size is something she has got used to. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The obsession with my size gets on my nerves a lot less now than it used to. I am happy with the way I am.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClaire lives in Middlesex with her hubby Reece, 43, an electrician and their children, Charlie, four, and two-year-old Daisy. </p>\n<p>\nShe added: \"My husband loves me, my kids love me and nobody I am working with thinks it's an issue. If I look out into that audience when I'm up on stage with Steps, at least there will be women out there just like me who will feel a bit better about themselves because I am not a size 8. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am not trying to make a stand about my figure  but I've been a size 8 and I was miserable. I probably could have gone down to that size again  but what's the point if you are not going to be that for ever? </p>\n<p>\n\"I don't want to be yo-yoing any more  and if that means I'll just be a bit bigger, that's just the way it's got to be. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not like I am starting out now. Steps wouldn't be the same if I wasn't in it, so they can't say to me now, 'You have to lose weight otherwise you can't be in the group'. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is no way anyone could tell me I'm too big or I have to lose weight now  because they can't do the tour without me. </p>\n<p>\n\"As a group, we always said if one of us didn't want to do it, then it wouldn't happen. They are certainly not going to kick me out for being a size 16.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nClaire is also hosting Lorraine's Cake Club, a search on Sun columnist Lorraine Kelly's ITV show to find Britain's best cake. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the singer reckons most online comments and tweets about her are supportive. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I would say that 95 per cent of people are saying, 'I think she looks great'. </p>\n<p>\n\"From doing the TV show Slave To Food last year about the kind of trouble I have had to deal with about my weight, I was surprised by the response I got. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had people saying, 'Thank you, you are so brave for doing that show. I can now look at a person on telly and say that she is just like me'. </p>\n<p>\n\"Many women have said to me, 'Hearing you talk about this stuff is like looking in the mirror.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There aren't many of us out there who will be honest and say, 'I struggle with my weight'. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I don't really want to struggle any more, so this is me  and if you don't like it, tough.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>n.watkins@the-sun.co.uk </a></b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Claire's changing body </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"></h2>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>1999 </b> size 8, 8st 7Ib<b> </b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2005  </b>size 16, 13st </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2008  </b>size 18, 15st </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2008  </b>size 10, 10st 7Ib </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2009  </b>size 18, 15st </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>2011 </b> size 14-16, 12st </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Curvy ...

I treat her as often as I can and when Mother's Day comes around I try and do something a little extra special. </p>\n<p>\n\"This coming Mother's Day I know that my two boys will wake me up with breakfast in bed, it's usually burnt toast and a luke warm cup of tea, and it will be the best breakfast I'll have all year! </p>\n<p>\n\"I know we'll have a lovely family day but for many mothers around the world they won't be comforted by those certainties, they have no idea how their day will begin or how it will end. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll be thinking of these mums this Mothers Day who'll be fighting to save their child's life, desperately trying to find enough food so that their child can survive Mother's Day, and then the next day and every day after that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sure you've seen in the news, as I have, that more than a million children across both East and West Africa are at risk of dying over the coming months if they do not receive more help soon. </p>\n<p>\n\"UNICEF, the world's leading children's organisation, is already there with local partners to try and help children and their families before its too late, but they urgently need more funds to be able to do this. </p>\n<p>\n\"As a mum, all you want to do is protect and provide for your family, I can't begin to feel how desperate, frustrated and anxious these mums must be all the time without any food to feed their children. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have travelled to East Africa and I found the sight of malnourished children heartbreaking. I talked to some of these kids and was shocked to hear how little they ate on a daily basis. </p>\n<p>\n\"I find it almost impossible to imagine that with a supermarket on every corner and all the food I could want, that around the world every hour, 300 children are still dying from hunger. </p>\n<p>\n\"Just think, by the time you've read this paper, had a cup of tea and phoned your mum, another 300 children will have died, just because they don't have enough to eat. </p>\n<p>\n\"This Mother's Day, it's not about feeling guilty for what you've got, or feeling like you can't be spoilt. Of course you can. It's just about taking a moment to remember these mums and their children who won't be celebrating this year, and do your bit to help them. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm doing my bit by supporting UNICEF's Mother's Day campaign and you can too. </p>\n<p>\n\"UNICEF is calling on everyone to buy a Nutritional Inspired Gift, which are life saving food supplies delivered directly to the mums and the children that need it most, like those in West Africa. </p>\n<p>\n\"My favourite is a special high protein paste  Plumpy Nut - which can take a child from the brink of death to healthy in a matter of weeks. You can help save a life for just &#163;12, that's pretty amazing and that's exactly what I'll be buying my mum this Mother's Day. </p>\n<p>\nThis Mother's Day help a mum save their child's life and buy a nutritional UNICEF Inspired gift from www.unicef.org.uk/inspired.</a> \"\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"A Mother's Day wish ...

I know the people who come in regularly and we'll go for a coffee together. I wake up feeling really excited about seeing everyone in the shop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThis urge to give her time for a good cause isn't part of a publicity stunt and it isn't a one-off appearance for the sake of our cameras. </p>\n<p>\nAnd she wasn't the one to reveal her job to the world either. </p>\n<p>\nIt was picked up on by a local paper and her volunteering then became national news. Her reasons for helping out are genuine. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'm about to turn 41, I've had a really good innings and I just want to do stuff for other people. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's karma. I've had lots of fun in my life and I've got lots of nice things and some people need help, so why not give a bit back? More people should be doing it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe store in London's Primrose Hill is one of Mary Portas's five UK Living And Giving charity outlets, which raise cash for Save The Children. </p>\n<p>\nThey look nothing like a stereotypical charity shop. Instead they are beautifully decorated, community-focused boutiques filled with sumptuous goodies, some of which have been donated by fashion designers and businesses. </p>\n<p>\nAnd former pin-up girl Gail has been doing regular shifts since she spotted a sign in the shop window asking for volunteers. Gail, mum to Honey, nine, says: \"I do a lot of voiceovers for Nickelodeon, I do Sky News and The Wright Stuff on TV and I'm writing a book. But I've got no structure to my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"I said to the shop manager that I can't guarantee I'll be available at certain times but here's my number. If I can help in any way, I'd love to come in. </p>\n<p>\n\"Every week, the manager texts us to say how much the shop raised. It makes you feel really good. </p>\n<p>\n\"I would recommend it to anyone and I think more people in the limelight should be doing it. </p>\n<p>\n\"I know what the schedules are like in TV. You get made up, you do a couple of hours filming, then you've got time to work in your local charity shop for a while.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's from this upmarket corner of London that Gail is slowly rebuilding her life after one of the worst years she has ever had. </p>\n<p>\nLast April she was sectioned for almost a month after sending a despairing text to her then boyfriend, Jonny Davies, who feared for her welfare. She says: \"I think that was the lowest point. My ex-husband Dan (<i>Hipgrave  guitarist with the band Toploader</i>) came over and said it was the worst he had seen me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I don't worry that it will happen again, I hope I've come through it. I still cry a lot. I'm up and down.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGail  who famously had a snap of her naked body projected on to the the Houses of Parliament in 1999  has suffered from depression since she was a teenager. She has also battled anorexia. </p>\n<p>\nShe developed stress-related alopecia in 2005, which causes her hair to fall out. And in the last few years she has lost her mum, two grandparents and, most recently, her beloved dog Missy. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I haven't had the best few years, as everyone knows. I just want to feel better about myself and do things for other people. When I was low, I was very low and I would quite happily not get up each day. That's a real waste of time when you could be helping other people instead of feeling sorry for yourself. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not the easiest thing in the world to get out and do it but it's just nice being around other people, knowing you're all doing something for others.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGail, who says she may consider another stint in rehab to help further with her depression, explains that her daughter and ex-hubby  have been her towers of strength during these difficult times. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Honey has been brilliant and so has her dad. Dan has totally supported me through everything. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"It's quite odd, as when you're divorced you should want to kill each other, but he's been brilliant.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nNow Gail has caught the volunteering bug she hopes to devote as much time as possible to charity work. </p>\n<p>\nIn between working on documentaries and writing a book about her experiences of being sectioned, Gail wants to help out at London Zoo, something Honey is feeling very jealous about. Gail is also training to compete in a triathlon to raise cash for The Children's Trust in Tadworth, Surrey. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'm jogging for two hours a day. My problem is swimming. Honey is a much better swimmer than me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor a woman who has been through so much, it's good to hear she still has her sense of humour. And she uses this in her occasional stand-up comedy gigs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I do it about my insane life,\" she says. \"When you've got a problem and you talk about it in a funny way, people laugh nervously. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's so nerve-racking. I've been sick before going on stage but once you get the first laugh it's all right. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I got loads of abuse when I first started losing my hair because I kept making jokes about it.

And remember, everyone's eyes are different, so you just have to go with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCheryl, who gained fame as one fifth of Girls Aloud, is often seen looking effortlessly glamorous at showbiz bashes. </p>\n<p>\nBut the star has said that she sometimes looks back at some of her old beauty looks from her days in the band and can't believe that she pulled them off. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes I think a certain look was actually ahead of its time, like the black and white eyes in the Sexy! No No No video. On the day, it was wacky. But now you look at Lady Gaga or different big make-up looks and it seems really normal. I like to make a bit of a statement.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd treading the red carpet is still \"terrifying\" to the seasoned star. </p>\n<p>\n\"We once had this nightmare where my dress ripped here, somebody was sewing here, my nail had just chipped so somebody was painting them. Then I walked out, tripped in the middle of the corridor, grabbed the security guy and tore all my nail polish off. I had burgundy nail polish all down my white dress. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"So I said 'Wait until I figure out how I am going to manoeuvre this handbag so that my nails are covered.' </p>\n<p>\n\"So, that's how I walked down the carpet. It was absolute pandemonium. Anyone who says that they love red carpets is lying. Getting dressed up is the best part. And champagne after the event  that's even better.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the full interview visit the Stylist</a> website. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Cole position ...

And then the application of the killer touch. </p>\n<p>\nYes, they had a couple of close calls but for their overall display and the manner in which they went about the task at hand, they more than deserved that. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the centre of it all was a defence that has had more than its share of criticism this season  and a defence, at that, minus the redoubtable Branislav Ivanovic. </p>\n<p>\nDavid Luiz, one of the most criticised of all, was peerless on his return to the Stadium of Light while, alongside him, skipper John Terry was back to his most solid and reliable best. </p>\n<p>\nAshley Cole never wavered and you couldn't even fault the once high-risk Paulo Ferreira, making only his third start of the season. </p>\n<p>\nAnd so it all comes thick and fast for Chelsea. </p>\n<p>\nA trip to Villa Park, one of their least favourite grounds, on Saturday. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the thought at the back of everyone's minds that, with the spectre of Barcelona looming, the only certain way of qualifying for next season's Champions League is to somehow close the five-point gap separating them from Tottenham and fourth place. </p>\n<p>\nBut, for the moment, Chelsea fans are toasting a team with one foot in this season's semi-final. </p>\n<p>\nThrow in another last-four date  with Spurs in the FA Cup  and it's all looking a lot more encouraging than it once did. </p>\n<p>\nChelsea had gone into the game as the last standard-bearers of English football. </p>\n<p>\nIt has been as poor a season in Europe as it could have been for those teams who had dominated the Champions League for almost a decade. </p>\n<p>\nBut Chelsea are still there, flying the flag and defending the battered reputation of our top clubs after one of their grittiest displays this term. </p>\n<p>\nIt was all far removed from the 4-0 thrashing Arsenal suffered at the San Siro. </p>\n<p>\nAll far removed from the 3-1 beating Chelsea themselves were handed in Naples. </p>\n<p>\nAnd certainly a world away from the 2-0 defeat that could have been four or five that Manchester United collapsed to in Bilbao. </p>\n<p>\nThat Blues interim boss Roberto Di Matteo left Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, Michael Essien and Daniel Sturridge on the bench was the clearest indication that he wanted to make sure there was still a tie for Chelsea to contest back at Stamford Bridge. </p>\n<p>\nHe didn't want all the trauma of having to overturn the sort of two-goal lead Napoli had taken to West London last time out. </p>\n<p>\nSo he fielded a team with players to cover, drop back in defence and stymie a Benfica team that had scored in every home game this season  and that meant younger legs in front of the back four. </p>\n<p>\nYes, Luiz had to clear off the line early in the second half. </p>\n<p>\nAt the same time, Juan Mata almost put Chelsea ahead on the hour with a shot that came back off a post. </p>\n<p>\nAnd then, as the Blues back four started to creak, Jardel should have buried a header that keeper Petr Cech somehow scrambled away. Kalou, though, made no mistake with the game's defining moment. </p>\n<p>\nNo, Benfica were not the toughest draw. And they certainly didn't live up to any of the advance publicity. </p>\n<p>\nYes, it was nice to watch, all pretty enough in its own way. But, unlike their eagle, the hosts didn't have the fear factor. </p>\n<p>\nLampard says Chelsea are not as good as they used to be  and last night they didn't necessarily have to be. </p>\n<p>\nBut they did more than enough. And so the journey continues. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"UP BEFORE THE BEAK ...

The Ivorian barely figured for Chelsea when Andre Villas-Boas was in charge.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut since Di Matteo took command earlier this month he has come right back into the reckoning.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 26-year-old is out of contract in the summer and is tipped for a possible move to Arsenal.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut his issue at Stamford Bridge has never been about money, it is about getting regular games.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis strike will certainly have helped his argument, although it is unlikely Di Matteo will be in charge to have a say about his future.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFor now, though, the pair are enjoying themselves and Di Matteo hoisted Kalou into the air at the final whistle in celebration.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Champions League is treating the interim boss very well. He has a 100 per cent record from two games.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Italian masterminded the extraordinary turnaround against Napoli in the previous round and now this in the first leg of the quarter-final.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet before kick-off, we wondered if he had signed his own death warrant the way Villas-Boas did when he axed the old guard for the last-16 first-leg game in Naples and lost 3-1.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFrank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Michael Essien were all dumped on the bench last night.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet there was a shock recall for another oldie, 33-year-old Paulo Ferreira, who was picked at right-back having not featured at all since the New Year's eve defeat against Aston Villa. Ferreira coped well  in what was only his third start of the season  against the much-hyped Argie Nicolas Gaitan.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was part of a very well oiled Chelsea defensive machine of which David Luiz was the star.\n</p>\n<p>\nLuiz was back at the club where he made his name and marked his performance with a crucial chest block on the line from Paraguayan striker Oscar Cardozo's volley just after half-time.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe also showed incredible coolness in the first half to control a ball on his knee right in front of keeper Petr Cech before volleying it away.\n</p>\n<p>\nDi Matteo has made the point that Chelsea are much tighter defensively these days and the manager must take credit for that. They were immense in keeping out Spurs last Saturday and once more were right on it in Lisbon.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was not until late in the first half that Chelsea offered any real threat going forward when Torres, preferred to Drogba, worked himself some space in the penalty area only to curl his shot a yard over the bar.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen Torres picked out Kalou, who laid a ball back for Raul Meireles and he caught it flush from 30 yards, forcing a smart save from Artur going full length to his left.\n</p>\n<p>\nWith the scores level at half-time, the visitors could be well satisfied with their efforts. Being greedy, an away goal was the ideal for Di Matteo's men to make it a perfect night's work.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut first they survived when Luiz made his block and the referee ignored the home fans' screams for a penalty as they claimed their former hero handled.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen Torres crossed from the left and Kalou was in space to meet the header but he put it over when he should have done better.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was another escape for Chelsea as Maxi Pereira's volleyed cross hit skipper John Terry's arm at close range.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe crowd were again baying for a penalty and their tempers would have gone up another notch had Juan Mata (right) scored when he latched on to Cech's long kick. The Spaniard went round the keeper but hit the outside of the post with the angle narrowing.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlex Witsel's shot landed on the roof of the net after deflecting off Terry and Cech beat out a header from Jardel.\n</p>\n<p>\nLampard came on to replace Meireles in a stadium where he scored three goals for England at Euro 2004 and another in the penalty shootout when they lost to Portugal in the quarter-finals.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe will have fancied his chances of adding to his tally on this ground but it was left to the unsung Kalou to do the damage.\n</p>\n<p>\nRamires, like Luiz a former Benfica star, fed Torres down the right and the striker bustled his way into the area.\n</p>\n<p>\nTorres took a quick look up before playing a delightful ball across the six-yard box where Kalou converted.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt has been such a strange season for Chelsea yet they are still fighting in two cup competitions, with their FA Cup semi-final now confirmed as being against Tottenham.\n</p>\n<p>\nWho knows how this will all end.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN  DAVID LUIZ (CHELSEA) </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>CHELSEA: </b>Cech 7, Ferreira 7, Luiz 8, Terry 7, Cole 7, Ramires 6, Meireles 7, Mata 6, Mike 7, Kalou 7, Torres 7.

Sunderland were blown away, putting in the kind of display which got Steve Bruce the sack. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMarouane Fellaini and Tim Cahill were outstanding and Moyes said: \"If we hadn't won tonight there would have been something wrong. </p>\n<p>\n\"We got here a little bit late and I hear it's quite regular up here. That bolstered us, gave us a wee edge. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Quite a few things didn't go right and we should have maybe won by a few more goals. But it was a great win. </p>\n<p>\n\"Liverpool will be favourites. They've beaten us twice this season so they'll go in as favourites. We'll go down there and play  sometimes it suits us being an underdog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn truth, it was more than comfortable for Everton who could have won by at least five. </p>\n<p>\nDisappointed Black Cats boss Martin O'Neill admitted: \"The expectations were high having done so well to get here. But you have to perform, pass and control under pressure and we didn't do it well enough. </p>\n<p>\n\"If you cannot do the simple things then you have no chance.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThese two looked evenly matched in the first game 10 days ago.But at the end of 90 pulsating minutes, they were miles apart. </p>\n<p>\nSunderland's best player was keeper Simon Mignolet  enough said. </p>\n<p>\nThe Belgian kept out the rampaging Cahill and Jelavic but the Croatian would not be denied on 24 minutes. Fellaini fed Magaye Gueye down the left and Jelavic took advantage of some horrific marking from the hapless Sotirios Kyrgiakos to ram home the low cross. </p>\n<p>\nCue complete and utter bedlam in among the 6,000 in the away end. </p>\n<p>\nFor the home side, Bendtner almost got hold of a James McClean cross on the half-hour before Sebastian Larsson curled a free-kick just wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut within 90 seconds of the restart Leon Osman nearly sealed it with a brilliant volley which whistled just wide. </p>\n<p>\nO'Neill hauled off Kyrgiakos for Vaughan. But just four minutes after coming on the Welshman slotted into his own net after Mignolet had half-stopped a Jelavic shot that did not seem to be going in. </p>\n<p>\nVaughan somehow managed to take one touch with his left foot before sliding home with his right. </p>\n<p>\nStephane Sessegnon smacked the bar two minutes later, but Tim Howard still had not made a save. </p>\n<p>\nJelavic continued to cause panic in the shaky Sunderland backline and only the Croatian will know how he failed to make it three on 61 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nTempers frayed late on  with ref Lee Probert booking three players  when handbags were thrown after Phil Neville appeared to catch McClean with an elbow. </p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately for O'Neill, it was the only time his side showed any real fight and urgency. Liverpool ought to beware their neighbours. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SUNDERLAND 0 EVERTON 2 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN  MAROUANE FELLAINI (EVERTON) </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SUNDERLAND: </b>Mignolet 7, Bardsley 6, Kyrgiakos (Vaughan 5) 5, Turner 5, Bridge (Campbell 6) 5, Larsson 6, Cattermole 5, Gardner 5, McClean 5, Sessegnon 5, Bendtner 5.

The memory of another Bolton player being taken off here in far more serious circumstances just 10 days ago earned him a ripple of applause from around the ground  but he certainly did not deserve it. </p>\n<p>\nBale was again the danger on 36 minutes ripping a snorter just wide. Next Scott Parker burst towards the six-yard box only to see his close-range effort kept out, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThen came the 41st minute, the time when Muamba suffered his cardiac arrest here in the first game. </p>\n<p>\nThis time it produced a Bale drive that curled just too much and flew past the post as Bolton fans began a chorus of \"Fabrice Muamba\" to mark the moment. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTottenham were just as relentless after the break. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRafael van der Vaart rattled the bar with a terrific free kick, then Adebayor, broke through the middle for a one-on-one but his low shot bounced off Bogdan's knee. This was getting silly. </p>\n<p>\nAnd when Bogdan denied Adebayor for the umpteenth time, Spurs' boss Harry Redknapp was up on his feet shaking his head in disbelief. </p>\n<p>\nHe would have been hanging his head if Ivan Klasnic had put Bolton ahead on a rare attack soon afterwards. </p>\n<p>\nSo Redknapp sent on sub Jermain Defoe and what happened? A goal-bound left-footer was saved by Bogdan! </p>\n<p>\nWhen the keeper pushed over Bale's header, Spurs die-hards must have been fearing a replay. But Nelsen and Bale finally changed all of that to leave the Lane rocking and heading for Wembley. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN  ADAM BOGDAN (BOLTON) </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TOTTENHAM: </b>Cudicini 7, Walker 7, Assou- Ekotto 6, King 6, Nelsen 7, Modric 7, Livermore 6, Parker 8 (Defoe 6), Bale 8, van der Vaart 8 (Rose 6), Adebayor 8 (Saha 6).

Now they went the other way with a reckless mixture of heaves and sweeps.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll this after seven of the squad arrived early in Sri Lanka  five days before the rest  in order to acclimatise and practise against spin.\n</p>\n<p>\nStrauss and Stuart Broad picked the wrong balls to sweep, Matt Prior and Samit Patel were leg before on the back foot when they should have gone forward.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Kevin Pietersen was bowled reaching for a drive from his first ball after lunch.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for Jonathan Trott, he perished to one of the most bizarre  and frankly comical  Test dismissals imaginable.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe missed a full toss from Herath and was stumped by Prasanna Jayawardene. But that was only the half of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nTrott's helmeted head collided with the Sri Lankan keeper's gloves and he collapsed as though felled by a Klitschko right hand. He wandered off, a little groggy and a lot embarrassed.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lower-order shamed the specialist batsmen as the final four wickets added 101  after the first six put on 92. Broad was second-highest scorer, Swann fourth, James Anderson fifth and, praise be, Monty Panesar the sixth best.\n</p>\n<p>\nIan Bell made 52  one more than in the entire series against Pakistan  before falling to a fine delivery from Herath which pitched on middle stump and hit off.\n</p>\n<p>\nHerath bowled well but he is essentially a spinner in the style that England have seen hundreds of times down the years in county cricket. The pitch offered some assistance but to be bowled out in a session and a half was nothing short of scandalous.\n</p>\n<p>\nBell said: \"It was good to spend some time in the middle, get some rhythm and change a pair of gloves for the first time this winter!\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But our score is not going to lie. To make fewer than 200 is not good, especially with nothing in the pitch to scare batsmen.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It's not a lack of effort as we are all trying to get better at playing spin. We're working hard, trying to get into good positions to use our feet. But it's a long-term goal and won't happen overnight.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"What's very disappointing is not to back up our bowlers again who have been outstanding for the fourth Test running this winter. We have let them down by not giving them more time to rest in this heat.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"With the DRS, we're more aware that we have to play with our bat rather than the pad. You have to hit more, you can't kick anything.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThings started badly for England when the opening over of day two by Anderson went for 16 runs  eight off the bat of No 10 Chanaka Welegedera and eight leg-byes.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnderson's slower ball did for Welegedera and he collected his fifth wicket of the innings when Jayawardene was last man out for a superb 180 out of Sri Lanka's 318.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlastair Cook fell for nought to an inswinger from Welegedera and then England hit self-destruct.\n</p>\n<p>\nMind you, Sri Lanka also made a poor fist of it in their second innings. Broad speared one through Tillakaratne Dilshan's defences and then Swann took the next four.\n</p>\n<p>\nLarihu Thirimanne was bowled by a beauty, Mahela was held at slip, Kumar Sangakkara edged to gully and Thilan Samaraweera had a brain storm and gave Swann the charge and was stumped.\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"FLOORED ...
