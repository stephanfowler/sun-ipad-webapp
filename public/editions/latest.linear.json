All she has ever wanted was to rebuild their relationship and now it looks like her prayers have been answered.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Ghanaian immigrants Rose, 46, and hubby Thomas were advised to hand Mario to foster parents when he was two.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey were living in a cramped flat in Brescia, Italy, and he was recovering from operations on his intestines. </p>\n<p>\nThey said the richer Balotelli family who took him in then turned him against them. </p>\n<p>\nThe player dubbed Super Mario by fans went on to star for Inter Milan before being bought by City for &#163;23million. </p>\n<p>\nHe reacted angrily when Rose and Thomas first said they want to be reunited with him, claiming they were just after his money. </p>\n<p>\nBut Rose, who barely speaks English, showed her determination for a reconciliation by moving with her 13-year-old daughter Angel. </p>\n<p>\nHer other son, 18-year-old Enoch, is a promising footballer in England after trials with Stoke and Sunderland while daughter Abigail, 23, runs a fashion store near Milan. </p>\n<p>\nAbigail told The Sun: \"My mum will be closer to Mario and Enoch but I will stay here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Giuseppe Toninelli, owner of the metal works where Thomas has worked for 15 years, said: \"He has left. He was going to Ghana before joining the family in Manchester. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think they are all trying to patch up their differences.\" </p>\n<p>\nA neighbour in Wythenshawe said: \"Rose is doing this herself to show it is not about money. </p>\n<p>\n\"This is the house she can afford.

But firms claim the PM has made matters worse by piling on extra red tape. </p>\n<p>\nA Sun investigation has found thousands of the complex rules. Many bog down staff with forms or simply make it too costly to hire new staff. The barmy rules include: </p>\n<p>\n<b>SHOPS</b> wanting to sell ant-killer or toilet descaler must apply for a &#163;35 poisons licence. </p>\n<p>\n<b>A BOOZE</b> licence is needed to sell chocolate liqueurs  and they cannot be displayed next to lingerie because it would link alcohol to sex. </p>\n<p>\n<b>STORE</b> chiefs wanting to open a new warehouse face an 18-month battle  while rivals in Germany get up and running in just four months. </p>\n<p>\nChancellor George Osborne insists red tape reform has saved business &#163;3.3billion and has vowed to shake-up planning laws to \"get Britain building\". </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Institute of Directors head Simon Walker said: \"The more red tape there is, the harder it is to grow the economy. </p>\n<p>\n\"We've seen only minor changes when we need a revolutionary reduction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>A survey of 1,200 small and medium-sized firms by the British Chambers of Commerce found most feel choked by regulations.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe BCC estimates that the right to request flexible working hours will cost &#163;4.8million a year. </p>\n<p>\nThe EU's working time directive, which forces firms to give workers extra time off if they fall ill on holiday, will hit small firms hard  with an annual &#163;102.9million cost. </p>\n<p>\nAnd shared parental leave, which gives both parents the right to take a chunk of time off work, will cost firms an estimated &#163;20.5million a year. BCC director general John Longworth said: \"Many businesses are already worried about the risk involved in taking on new workers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Experts estimate that EU regulation alone has cost the UK economy</i> <b>&#163;124BILLION</b> since 1998. </p>\n<p>\nVincenzo Scarpetta, an analyst with think-tank Open Europe, said: \"EU red tape still imposes huge and unnecessary costs on UK businesses, in turn hurting jobs and growth. </p>\n<p>\n\"The EU and the UK need to do far more to deliver on promises to cut regulation. We simply can't afford not to.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBritain is also the third slowest country in Europe for signing work deals  taking 161 days on average. That delays contracts to private firms. </p>\n<p>\n<i>In his 2010 election manifesto, Mr Cameron promised to sweep away red tape burdens created by Labour.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA month before the election, he declared: \"It's time we brought business sense to Government and showed Britain is back open for business.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a split in the coalition has seen the EU-friendly Lib Dems constantly resisting moves to opt out of Brussels diktats. </p>\n<p>\nMeasures to protect small firms were finally unveiled in October, leaving Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable furious with other departments for dragging their feet. </p>\n<p>\n<b>TELL</b> us your red tape nightmares.

For example, we did not bother applying for grants for our apprenticeship scheme because it would have cost us more than the grants were worth. </p>\n<p>\n\"And recently a training provider refused to give us names and details of people they would put forward for our apprentice scheme because this would breach the Data Protection Act. </p>\n<p>\n\"Jobs are scarce in the current climate, but the Government is hindering firms like mine from creating vacancies due to all the paperwork we have to negotiate. </p>\n<p>\n\"We need less and better regulation and streamlined procedures designed for business first and government second.\" <br></br>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nNEWSAGENT </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h2>\nMavlin Patel has started his LA News shop in London <br></br>\n</h2>\n<p>\nMAVLIN, 26, took over a newsagents six months ago. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It is a penny by penny business at the best of times  and in the current climate it's even worse. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm finding it so hard to make any profit. Even worse than that, I have to spend some of that hard-earned cash on complying with red tape. </p>\n<p>\n\"And some of it is really silly stuff.

We are also getting to the stage where we are exporting it to the places where we were importing it from.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOne Brit said on an internet forum: \"If you've been to a Dutch space caf&#233; it looks like you could have been munching space cakes with THC <i>(the chemical compound in cannabis)</i> from an industrial unit just off the M1, or maybe a cash-strapped office worker from the burbs.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom inner-city council houses to trendy loft apartments and affluent town houses, UK cannabis cultivation is booming. </p>\n<p>\nSome  known as \"guerrilla growers\"  even secretly plant cannabis on other people's land. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1997 only 11 per cent of cannabis sold on UK streets was grown here. A decade later the figure had passed 60 per cent and now it is believed to be closer to 80 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nMuch of the trade is run by Vietnamese and Chinese gangs. Some place immigrants, called \"ghosts\", in houses as plant-sitters. But British gangsters are increasingly muscling in on the huge profits involved. </p>\n<p>\nA farm of 30 to 40 plants can make &#163;5,000 every eight weeks  the time it takes for a new cannabis plant to flower. </p>\n<p>\nNormally growers use multiple rooms so a second crop, propagated with cuttings from a \"mother plant\", can be grown while a first is harvested. Many concentrate on \"connoisseur\" brands such as White Widow, Blueberry or AK-47. </p>\n<p>\nNearly 7,000 cannabis factories, containing 750,000 plants, with an estimated yield valued at &#163;85million, were discovered by police in 2009-10, double the figure two years earlier. </p>\n<p>\nFormer police officer Allen Morgan, 43, an expert witness in court cases involving cannabis farms, said last night: \"It's an incredibly profitable business. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's potentially more profitable than cocaine dealing. There's no real outlay once you've bought the equipment. Growers usually bypass the electricity meters.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAllen said spin-off industries had sprouted up around the farms. He added: \"Multi-skilled traders have grown up around the business. There are specialist gardeners, lighting and electricity experts. There is a market in growing equipment and seeds.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Since the economic downturn there has been an increase in the use of disused warehouses for production.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd recession-hit professionals have been tempted by the cash profits from drug dealers to rent rooms for growing the plants. </p>\n<p>\nLandlords also unwittingly rent out properties to the gangs. In 2010 the four-bedroom home of one of Britain's most senior cops was turned into a factory for potent \"skunk\" cannabis. Rod Jarman, a deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, had rented out the &#163;400,000 house in Abridge, Essex, through an online letting agent. </p>\n<p>\nCriminals had run up a &#163;20,000 electricity bill for the powerful lighting used to grow the plants. </p>\n<p>\nMuch of Britain's cannabis crop is exported. In the past three years 100kg of it has been seized by Customs at British ports or airports  a figure experts say is a fraction of the trade. There were 220 seizures of \"outbound\" cannabis at British ports between 2008 and 2011. </p>\n<p>\nThe Droylsden farm contained 116 \"high-grade\" female plants worth around &#163;60,000. No one was home when cops burst in. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the premises weren't booby-trapped. Police say gangs are taking extreme measures to ward off rivals. On one occasion, a garden gate at a house had been wired to the mains. Anyone touching the handle could have been severely injured or killed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce inside the Droylsden home officers heard a radio playing Barry Manilow's Copacabana. One of the Tactical Aid Unit officers revealed: \"They often leave a radio on to make out to the neighbours that there's someone in.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Crooks had tried to mask the odour with air fresheners and by placing duct tape on windows.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had bypassed the electricity meter so as not to draw attention to the lights for the plants. One resident, retired James Redmond, 66, said: \"The guy next door told us he could smell the dope through the walls. It was overpowering.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the past week alone, police based in Ashton-under-Lyne station have raided four cannabis farms seizing drugs with a street value of up to &#163;500,000. </p>\n<p>\nPolice have uncovered 5,120 cannabis factories across the North West in three years. They contained more than 345,000 plants with an estimated value of &#163;140million. </p>\n<p>\nCops use helicopters with thermal imaging cameras to detect the \"glow\" from the heat lamps. </p>\n<p>\nCannabis is Britain's most commonly used illegal drug. One in six people aged 16 to 24 had tried it in 2010/11 and an estimated two million people smoke it. </p>\n<p>\nOne inner-city dope dealer in Salford bragged that he used kids as young as 14 to tend to plants at dope farms. The 28-year-old said: \"It was like a gang initiation for the kids. They were s*** scared. I'd use people who owed drug money.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyone running a farm can get up to 14 years in jail. The penalty for possession varies from an &#163;80 fine to five years' imprisonment. </p>\n<p>\nDetective Superintendent John Lyons, from Titan, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, said: \"Cannabis is not the harmless drug it is often perceived as. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"An increasing number of people growing cannabis are funding dangerous, organised criminal gangs.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"High life ...

He likened it to when The X Factor winner Joe McElderry was robbed of the Christmas number one spot after an internet campaign to make Rage Against The Machine win. </p>\n<p>\nSimon said: \"If someone beats or competes, it means you've got to work better. And in a funny way the viewers benefit.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>He added: \"I thought I'd make a difference because I was in the mood to do it.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Holden is the only judge who has done all six series and Simon insists her position was never in doubt. </p>\n<p>\nThe line-up is now Simon, Amanda, Alesha Dixon and comedian David Walliams. </p>\n<p>\nSimon said: \"I couldn't do it without my Amanda. Alesha I've been after her for a long time and David I've wanted on the show for two years.\" </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC has lavished &#163;22million on The Voice and Simon blasted them for refusing to admit they are in competition with his shows. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They wanted to have a pop at BGT because it's too popular and they don't like The X Factor being as popular as it is.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he backed X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos to return  despite her sex tape shame. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I'm a hundred million per cent behind her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the latest series begins it has emerged BGT sensation Jonathan Antoine, 17, was so badly bullied about his weight that he suffered a nervous breakdown in October. </p>\n<p>\nWhen the 20-stone teenager came on stage with friend Charlotte Jaconelli, 16, Simon could be heard whispering to guest judge Carmen Electra: \"Just when you thought it can't get any worse.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as the pair performed Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's The Prayer, Jonathan's incredible opera voice won a standing ovation. </p>\n<p>\nOn last night's show Simon asked Jonathan if he would consider ditching pal Charlotte  but Jonathan valiantly refused. </p>\n<p>\nA spokesperson for mental health charity Mind welcomed the news BGT was supporting Jonathan  who is being monitored by a psychiatrist. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile Sam Kelly, 19, of Norfolk, wowed the BGT panel playing guitar and singing Adele's version of Make You Feel My Love.

All she has ever wanted was to rebuild their relationship and now it looks like her prayers have been answered.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Ghanaian immigrants Rose, 46, and hubby Thomas were advised to hand Mario to foster parents when he was two.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey were living in a cramped flat in Brescia, Italy, and he was recovering from operations on his intestines. </p>\n<p>\nThey said the richer Balotelli family who took him in then turned him against them. </p>\n<p>\nThe player dubbed Super Mario by fans went on to star for Inter Milan before being bought by City for &#163;23million. </p>\n<p>\nHe reacted angrily when Rose and Thomas first said they want to be reunited with him, claiming they were just after his money. </p>\n<p>\nBut Rose, who barely speaks English, showed her determination for a reconciliation by moving with her 13-year-old daughter Angel. </p>\n<p>\nHer other son, 18-year-old Enoch, is a promising footballer in England after trials with Stoke and Sunderland while daughter Abigail, 23, runs a fashion store near Milan. </p>\n<p>\nAbigail told The Sun: \"My mum will be closer to Mario and Enoch but I will stay here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Giuseppe Toninelli, owner of the metal works where Thomas has worked for 15 years, said: \"He has left. He was going to Ghana before joining the family in Manchester. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think they are all trying to patch up their differences.\" </p>\n<p>\nA neighbour in Wythenshawe said: \"Rose is doing this herself to show it is not about money. </p>\n<p>\n\"This is the house she can afford.

All I want is to meet him once. Just to hear him say my name would be so cool.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nTom met Katherine, now 49, at a New York club in 1987. When Jonathan was born she took the singer to court to prove he was the dad. </p>\n<p>\nTom finally agreed to pay maintenance in 1998 when judge Judith Sheindlin  TV's Judge Judy  ordered him to take a paternity test. Even then he only publicly acknowledged Jonathan's existence in an interview in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nJonathan, who lives in America, was convinced his dad would come to see him as he grew up, and would sing his hits to his mum. He said: \"I'd lie in bed imagining doing normal stuff with him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I thought he'd walk through the door, sit down and explain to me where he'd been. When I asked her, 'Where is he?' she'd tell me, 'He's an entertainer. He's busy. He can't be here right now'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'd see him on TV and that made me feel better. I'd think, 'She's right.

The passengers were collapsing all over the deck and being sick but I wasn't. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then the captain made the announcement, 'Do not worry. There hasn't been a tragedy at sea since the Titanic went down in 1912'. </p>\n<p>\n\"It wasn't true, of course, or heartening for us passengers. But yet again, the spectre of the Titanic had been raised.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin, his brothers and their parents were almost killed at sea themselves when, in 1967 on the way back from Australia, their ship travelled through the Suez Canal. </p>\n<p>\nHe recalls: \"A civil war was going on in Aden and our boat was fired upon. We were all ordered off the deck and into our cabins. It was quite exciting at the time but we could have all been killed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat same year Robin narrowly missed losing his life again, when he and his then wife-to-be, Molly, were involved in the Hither Green rail disaster, in south London, in which 49 people died. He says: \"I felt on top of the world that morning as the Bee Gees had just had a big hit with Massachusetts. Looking back, Massachusetts probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"Until that record hit the Top Ten I would never have been able to afford a First Class train ticket. But on that occasion, because Massachusetts was doing so well, I did. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And like everyone else travelling First Class that day, both Molly and I had more chance of surviving the crash than those who weren't. </p>\n<p>\n\"But though we did survive, I saw harrowing things I've never forgotten. </p>\n<p>\n\"Headless bodies being dragged out of the train wreck, people screaming. </p>\n<p>\n\"Molly and I were rushed to hospital in Lewisham so we could be examined for injuries. I had broken glass from the train windows tangled in my hair. </p>\n<p>\n\"It took days to remove it but that was really the least of it. The shock and the horror was far, far worse. When we got to the hospital it looked like a war zone. All around us people were being carried in on stretchers and some of their injuries were horrific. Suddenly, it all became too much for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"The worst thing of all was that I was unable to help anyone, to mitigate their suffering, I couldn't cope with that. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I knew I had to get away from all the carnage so I checked out of the hospital and instead went to stay with the Bee Gees' manager, Robert Stigwood. </p>\n<p>\n<b>\"After that I suffered a delayed reaction. For days and days I couldn't stop crying. In the end the only thing which saved me was my music, composing with my brothers and singing again.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But although I did recover, I'll never really forget the horror of the Hither Green train crash and the tragedy of all those poor souls who died or were injured in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin makes it clear that he does not think living through the rail disaster qualifies him for understanding the Titanic tragedy more than others. However, he believes it is easier for him to walk in the shoes of the doomed Titanic passengers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs an avid collector of Titanic memorabilia, he has always been obsessed by the tragedy. </p>\n<p>\nHis collection includes a pen fashioned from pieces of the wreckage. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a present from second wife Dwina, who also gave one to RJ. </p>\n<p>\nAnd that led him to change tack from composing pop music and, with RJ  also a talented musician  embark on composing his first classical work. </p>\n<p>\nRobin adds: \"It has taken us two years to complete The Titanic Requiem. </p>\n<p>\n\"Two years of dedication, and I'm definitely very proud of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRJ is also proud of the composition, and equally proud of his father's courage in working day and night on it while undergoing chemotherapy to combat his cancer. </p>\n<p>\nRJ says: \"He kept going on against all odds. He has been every inch a professional and he deserves a medal for it. For him to come straight out of chemotherapy and into the studio is incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"We've always been close but working on a piece of music that is meant to last for hundreds of years brought us even closer. </p>\n<p>\n<b>\"We composed the requiem in order to honour the memory of those who died and to celebrate the age in which they lived.\"</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin adds: \"I never pushed RJ to become a musician, though. I wanted him to excel at whatever he wanted to do but I never pressured him. </p>\n<p>\n\"As he grew older it turned out that he had a flare for melody, and like me and my brothers, who never had music lessons, he flourished. Our collaboration has been wonderful. We have already started working on our next joint classical composition, The First World War Requiem. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But neither of us will be giving up pop music, either. RJ will be recording an album, Instant Love, and I will be working with Barry again, I'm looking forward to it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I just hope that The Titanic Requiem will be a fitting memorial for all those brave souls who died during the tragedy, so they will never be forgotten.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the most moving elements in the requiem is the song Don't Cry Alone, which Robin sings. It tells of a man who knows he is going to die begging his wife not to cry alone when he's gone. </p>\n<p>\nIt is a song that Dwina finds particularly emotional. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"When Robin first played me the song he was in the middle of chemotherapy. I cried when I heard it. It brought up all my fears that I might lose him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Robin jokes: \"I was afraid that I might lose me, too. Luckily, I was wrong... \"</i>\n</p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>The Titanic Requiem is released as an album tomorrow and will be performed in concert at Central Hall in London's Westminster on April 11.

All of a sudden I could see myself in a gorgeous white dress, walking down the aisle with all my friends and family looking on proudly. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In that moment I decided I had to get married and started planning straight away. I wanted to put my name on the wedding waiting list there and then.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin minutes of returning home, Rearna decided both her dad Des, 54, and brother Landon, 19, would walk her down the aisle to the song A Case Of You by James Blake. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It's such a beautiful song, when I heard it on the radio I instantly said 'That's it'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEver since her visit to the church ten months ago, Rearna is \"like a woman possessed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite her friends mocking her sudden obsession with her fantasy wedding, Rearna hasn't stopped giving them details of her big day. </p>\n<p>\nShe admitted: \"My friends laugh at me. They couldn't understand when I first told them I'd started to plan a wedding without a boyfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"Suddenly, bridal shops and wedding magazines became interesting. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking through them for ideas, my mind raced with thoughts of invites, flowers and, of course, the dress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna was in Uckfield, East Sussex, for a day when she saw an ivory dress on a mannequin in the window of Fross Wedding Collections. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I stopped in my tracks. I'd seen dresses I liked in the magazines but nothing compared to this. </p>\n<p>\n\"I knew straight away it was the dress I was going to get married in and booked an appointment for later that day to try it on. </p>\n<p>\n\"My friend Leah Butson  she's a student too  and I both had tears in our eyes as I twirled in front of the mirror with the circular train trailing behind me. It was the stuff of dreams.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nReturning home that night, unable to stop thinking about her dream dress, Rearna began to panic that the dress would sell out before she had the funds to buy it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I just know how upset I'll be if I finally saved up the money only to find out it's gone. The only way is to put down a deposit of &#163;150, so I'm going to have to save so I can be safe in the knowledge it's mine. </p><p>\n\"I go in to try it on at least once a month and because I've been doing it for the past seven months shop owner knows me by name. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've even considered taking out a loan to cover the &#163;1,100 to put my mind at rest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna now visits the church every month to visualise her big day and measure up to work out how many flowers she will need. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I sit and picture how it will look. I've planned to have the whole interior lit up with a thousand tea light candles and the pews to be draped with off-white silk. I love animals, so I've asked my best friend if her dogs can be involved. They're going to be dressed in little suits and dresses and will accompany the bridesmaids down the aisle. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My friend Kirsty Naunton makes amazing cakes so I instantly got her on the phone to discuss what I wanted. </p>\n<p>\n\"The chosen cake is three tiers with white icing and diamante-style decorations.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make sure her dream wedding will not become a distant fantasy, Rearna has made a pact with a close friend, 23-year-old Jonny Gregson, that if neither is married by the age of 30, they'll tie the knot. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Age 28 is my goal so I have a few years to find someone, finalise my plans and save the &#163;30,000 I need.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough she's missing a groom, Rearna couldn't wait to break the news to those who make up the rest of the bridal party. </p>\n<p>\nBest friends Olivia Jones, 21, Leah, 22, Kirsty Naunton, 22, and Lil Griffin, 21, will all be bridesmaids. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Although they think I'm mad, they're all excited. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have already taken them to the shop to show them the pink dresses they'll be wearing.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith the ceremony planned in fine detail, Rearna will be taking her guests to the nearby beach for the reception in a giant marquee. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Living in Brighton, I've decided to have a party on the beach. </p>\n<p>\n\"Watching the sun set with my family and friends and new husband will be so amazing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe single bride-to-be does not want to leave any part unplanned so Rearna has recently finalised her food menu. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"My grandma Daisy Ackord is Jamaican and she makes the best food I've ever tasted, so she's in charge of catering for my big day. I'm going to have a West Indian menu consisting of jerk chicken, specialty rice and peas, ackee and saltfish and special Jamaican cakes for dessert.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna and her gran have worked out the Caribbean feast will cost &#163;50 a head. And for the music, she will hire a jazz-funk band. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I come from a very musical family and we're all big jazz fans so I've been keeping an eye out for one that can cater for weddings.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery time someone mentions getting married, Rearna always tries to slip in a mention of St Bartholomew's. </p>\n<p>\nThe singleton even spoke to someone who had been married at the venue.

We saw his horrifically burned body and we cannot get that image out of our minds.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMedical student Mundill Mahil, 20, was jailed last month for six years for GBH with intent. Harvinder Shoker, also 20, got life for murder, while 20-year-old Darren Peters was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Amandip and her mum Tajinder have asked the Attorney General to review the sentence handed to Mahil and set up an e-petition, Justice For Gagandip. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking out for the first time, Amandip added: \"He would not have been murdered if Mundill Mahil hadn't lured him to her flat in Brighton in a carefully orchestrated honeytrap. </p>\n<p>\n\"Mahil will be released for good behaviour in three years. It's outrageous. Other cases involving money and fraud get much more punishment. Gagandip's life has been taken. I believe something more needs to be done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip's body was found in the burning car in Blackheath, south-east London, in February last year. </p>\n<p>\nHe had been violently attacked in Brighton before being driven back to the capital and murdered. </p>\n<p>\n<i>A post-mortem examination revealed he was still alive when the fire in the car was started.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the second tragedy for the family in just 18 months. In September 2009 Gagandip's father Charanjit was murdered in India. Eight people are on trial there accused of being involved. </p>\n<p>\nGagandip took over his dad's packaging firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"We were only just starting to come to terms with the first murder when Gagan was killed. It has knocked the life out of me and Mum.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard that Mahil, from Chatham, Kent, had been Gagandip's girlfriend. He was in love but they split up in August 2010 after she alleged he had sexually assaulted her. </p>\n<p>\nShoker, his friend of five years, also fell in love with Mahil and decided to take revenge on the businessman. </p>\n<p>\nIn February last year she lured Gagandip to her house in Brighton. </p>\n<p>\nShe knew that Shoker and Peters, both from London, would be lying in wait for him. </p>\n<p>\nHe was beaten unconscious and bundled into the boot of the car. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"I only met Mahil once, when Gagandip brought her to our home. She was very pretty and confident and seemed a nice person. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My brother and I were very close and were both living at home and saw each other every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"He became very close to her and said she was a friend he trusted and who he could talk to about anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Look at how she betrayed his trust. She tried to destroy my brother's character in court. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he was a kind, generous man who would have done anything to help anyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDetective Superintendent Damian Allain, who investigated the case, said after the conviction: \"Throughout the investigation and trial Mahil portrayed herself as a victim. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is clear to me, now endorsed by the jury's verdict, that her actions were calculating and that she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy with Shoker and Peters of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which resulted in his death.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family say Gagandip had the world at his feet. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"He ran the family's successful employment agency and packaging business. He also set up and headed Sikh TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"In addition, he was the founder of the British Sikh Student Federation. He had made friends and contacts all around the world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHis mother Tajinder, 45, was equally proud of his achievements. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"He had done so much. I didn't think a 21-year-old would be capable of so much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm amazed how much he achieved. Never a day goes by when we don't think about him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am devastated by my son's killing and struggling to cope. In my life there's only a dead end. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There's nothing left ahead. The whole story has finished here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe now runs the family business, which employs 300 people. But with the emotional turmoil of losing her son she found it almost impossible to carry on with it. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"When I first learned of Gagandip's death I was completely and utterly broken. </p>\n<p>\n\"I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on. I do not have the support of a husband because he also died not so long before Gagan. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I cannot describe on an average day my life since Gagandip's death because they have all blended into one. </p>\n<p>\n\"In the early stages I couldn't hold a conversation without breaking down in tears and there were occasions when the police had to call an ambulance for me after I collapsed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCherished pictures from the family photo album show what a loving son and brother Gagandip was. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a picture of him at his 21st birthday party with killer Shoker. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Shoker turned up uninvited to the party. </p>\n<p>\n\"We knew things weren't right between Gagandip and Shoker by that stage. The photo of them together is so ironic as they look like the best of friends  and for over five years they were. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sickened by the thought that the man who holds his hand lovingly over my brother's heart in the photo is the same person who later beat him so terribly then burned him alive. </p>\n<p>\n\"He spent so much time around at our house that he practically lived here. </p>\n<p>\n\"What he did is such a terrible betrayal of trust.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip was cremated and his ashes scattered in a river at the Kiratpur Sahib temple in the Punjab, India. </p>\n<p>\nLike her mother, Amandip broke down when she remembered the precious times they had together. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I found it hard to go into his bedroom without getting very upset.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, though, they remember him with the shrine in the garden and in his former bedroom in south east London. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Mum and I actually slept in his room as a way of trying to feel closer to him. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now we have turned his bedroom into a shrine, with a large photo of him on the bed and all his clothes and possessions are still in the room.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Gagandip's mum and sister are still clearly in pain over his loss  but their grief would be easier to bear if they felt justice had been done.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional reporting: MARK CHRISTY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3982615/Revenge-killing-of-TV-boss.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'Revenge killing' of TV boss"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3683937/Grieving-mum-in-battle-with-Turkish-cops.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Our son was drugged and murdered for £150 a few hours after this holiday snap... now we want justice"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF24hon5n---532_1476721a.jpg","caption":"Honeytrapper ...

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

Sometimes they literally just faint. But occasionally, they have a cardiac arrest.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs one of a few doctors there when I joined the Lords 17 years ago, I was appalled how poor were the arrangements for these sudden, terrifying emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe attendant staff had often been trained in mouth-to-mouth and cardiac resuscitation, but there was no defibrillator anywhere in Parliament. This piece of kit is a life-saver.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen its electrodes are applied across the chest, its sudden pulse of high voltage electricity can jolt the heart back into a normal rhythmic beat. It's a clever device because its detector only allows an electric shock if the collapsed patient has had a cardiac arrest or a fatal change of heart rhythm.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it is safe and exceptionally easy to use by any layman with minimal training.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet when I tried to persuade the authorities in Parliament to obtain one of these portable machines (they are not expensive) officials in both Houses refused. Their excuses were shameful.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne official argued that we could not have a defibrillator as it would cause a problem if a tourist collapsed in the gallery  should we be obliged to offer resuscitation to a member of the public? It was suggested there might be legal consequences if it were used or not used. Four years later, an elderly peer collapsed right after speaking. There were no doctors present in the chamber and he died.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly then, reluctantly, was a defibrillator installed, and since then at least two lives have been saved. Cardiac arrest is extremely common yet it can be correctable. Clearly, it would help if everybody were trained in external cardiac massage, for example in schools. This knowledge would save some lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a clever defibrillator is a different matter. It is astonishing that so many public buildings do not have them readily available.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Those first few seconds after a cardiac emergency are critical and we must be prepared.\n</i></p>\n<p>\n<b>To sign The Sun-backed British Heart Foundation petition, click here</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4209790/Show-your-support-and-join-our-campaign-for-CPR-in-schools.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4210386/Medics-had-to-zap-Fabrice-Muamba-15-times.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4212641/Fabrice-Muambas-family-give-thanks-to-fans-as-star-recovers.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba's family give thanks to fans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4207991/Fabrice-Muamba-was-dead-for-78-minutes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba was 'dead' for 78 minutes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4205926/Fabrice-Muamba-asks-Did-we-lose.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba asks: Did we lose?"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF2428FX-532_1476788a.jpg","caption":"Race against time ... medics treat Muamba on the pitch and, inset, Lord Robert Winston"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H02NFX_1475388a.jpg"}]},"isArticle":true},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Counting the calories ...

Girls assume she is a porn star. Then there's the back pain. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Lots of women want big boobs but it's actually a total nightmare. </p>\n<p>\n\"The only men I attract are the sleazy type. It's rare that a guy looks me in the face when talking to me. </p>\n<p>\n\"Guys will flat-out stare and try all the cheesy chat-up lines. And a lot of the time they want their picture taken with them. Not me  <i>them</i>.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"Sometimes it can be a bit scary. A few blokes will try to get really hands-on. When I'm out with my male friends they'll usually circle round me. They're my bodyguards.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't fare much better with other girls. She says: \"Women assume my boobs are fake  they look at me like I'm a porn star. It's older women who always comment on them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They'll tut and shake their heads as they walk past me in the street. I can hear them saying, 'They're so fake', and, 'Look at her flaunting them'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I try to smile through it. I know they're real but sometimes it can be hurtful. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've developed a way of walking so my boobs bounce up and down and people can see they're real. It looks like I'm walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\n\"Women can get quite jealous  that's probably why I have more male friends.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut meeting the right guy is difficult. Glasgow girl Stephanie says: \"I broke up with my ex in 2010. He couldn't handle all the attention I get and became insanely jealous. </p>\n<p>\n\"When we were out he'd get mad when other guys checked me out. I tried telling him it couldn't be helped  he knew what he was getting into.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie has seen a few men since the split but no one special has caught her eye. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They become too obsessed with my boobs, it's all they think about. It's hard to find a guy to see past them. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of blokes are just after me for the status of it, they see it as just another notch on the bedpost. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I want my boyfriend to see me for me, I'm more than just a pair of boobs. I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half  but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs  though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that  it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4127333/Model-with-38KKK-boobs-is-saved-by-airbags.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Model with 38KKK boobs is saved by airbags"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4192971/TOWIE-star-Lauren-Pope-I-just-wanted-my-ticking-timebomb-PIP-breast-implants-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I was terrified my PIP implants were a ticking timebomb.

I don't reflect on such things easily because I've never been an emotional person. I'm logic personified. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back over my life, I tried to work out how and where the desire for independence began to make itself felt. </p>\n<p>\nAmong my earliest memories was when I was three and my mum Rita and nan Nina left me at home one day with my grandfather, Gerald, while they went shopping. </p>\n<p>\nI remember my mum and dad, Terry, had this elegant drinks cabinet in the lounge. As a toddler I was fascinated by it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe door folded down and all these beautiful little glasses and different-coloured bottles glinted away in the backlight. </p>\n<p>\nI decided to get a chair, climb up and have a good look. Everything looked even better close up. </p>\n<p>\nThe dainty little glasses (for sherry), the perfect size for me, were so tempting that I started to fill them with the green, yellow and clear liquids I saw in the bottles  cr&#232;me de menthe, advocaat and vodka. </p>\n<p>\nTaking little sips and inviting my dolls to do the same, I was having a wonderful time  until my grandfather came into the room and asked what I was doing. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, as soon as he twigged, he told me to stop. Three-year-old me instantly replied: \"This is my house and I'll do as I want.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe left me to it. He was married to my grandmother, so perhaps he knew not to pick a losing fight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Not surprisingly, when my mum and nan got home I was rolling drunk and, by all accounts, not much more co-operative.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather got an earful, I was put to bed and the story passed into family lore. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs my nan used to tell me: \"You were such a little cow  and you know what? You weren't sick, not once. Not a drop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got that streak in you as a toddler, no one's ever going to be able to tell you what to do when you're fully grown. </p>\n<p>\n<i>It wasn't a one-off, either.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA few months later my mum took me to school for the very first time. </p>\n<p>\nPicking me up after my first day, she asked the teacher how I had got on. She had been worried, my mum admitted, because I was very shy. </p>\n<p>\n\"Which one is your daughter?\" the teacher asked. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady,\" said my mother. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady?\" was the incredulous response. \"Shy? She walked in, pulled a boy off his chair and said, 'That's my seat. Move.' I wouldn't be worried if I was you!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was advice my mother took to heart. In fact, that was probably the last time she worried about me. </p>\n<p>\nThere were other powerful influences in my childhood. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of my grandmothers were hard workers, strong women and very important in moulding me. </p>\n<p>\nI was very close to Nina, my mother's mother, in particular, who put an end to that alcoholic tea party when I was three. She was dynamite. She was Italian  from Naples  and incredibly feisty. She would have killed for her family  she wouldn't have thought twice about it. </p>\n<p>\nIf someone cut up my grandfather in traffic, she would get out of the car and punch them on the nose. </p>\n<p>\nI'm sure it won't come as any surprise when I say she was definitely the one in control of her house and marriage. </p>\n<p>\nShe was great with money  not because she had a lot but because she knew the price of everything and she was in charge. </p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather went out to work as a postman but she would take his wages and give him cash to spend. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThat was just the way it was. Grandma Nina really believed in me. Her attitude was: You can do it, so go out there and get on with it. </p>\n<p>\nEven if I get a bit feisty at home now, my husband will still say to me, \"Oh, Nina's here. Nina's coming out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>I was fiercely determined. If I wanted something and my parents wouldn't give it to me, I would find a way to get it for myself.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI was never given pocket money. My parents always offered to buy me what I wanted but I wanted to be in charge of my own money. </p>\n<p>\nI recall them once saying no to something  I can't remember what it was  but I haven't forgotten what I decided to do. I put up signs in my bedroom window  it was my bedroom so I could do what I liked, I reasoned  saying, \"Massages, manicures, come inside!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mother was shouting up: \"Who are all these weirdos coming to the door?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I bawled back: \"They're my customers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI was bloody-minded too. I once put up a Vote Labour poster in my bedroom just because my parents were Conservatives. </p>\n<p>\nMy dad roared: \"Take that down!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"It's my bedroom!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"What does the poster even mean?\" And I didn't know, of course. I just knew it would wind him up and cause a debate. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 14, I'd tell my mum I was going to stay the night with my best friend, Charlotte, who would tell her mum she was staying at my house. </p>\n<p>\nAfter that we would meet up with our clothes in carrier bags, get changed, take the Tube into central London then go out in Soho. </p>\n<p>\nWhen everything closed we'd walk around until the Tube re-started in the early morning and go back to our borough  Enfield in north London. </p>\n<p>\nThen we walked around until 10am before we went home. </p>\n<p>\nMum would say, \"Well, you look very tired.\" But she never knew. Years later, when I told her, she was shocked. But I was even more shocked by what she said to me. </p>\n<p>\nShe looked at my daughter Sophie and said: \"What goes around, comes around.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI went very cold and felt terrible about what I had done. </p>\n<p>\nBut at the time I couldn't have cared less. </p>\n<p>\nNothing was going to happen to me. I was in control, I was safe  or at least I thought I was. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But if I imagine my 15-year-old Sophie going out all night now, well...</i> </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nThe day I made a name for myself </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nMY school had lots of careers days and companies came in and talked to us, including advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the London radio station LBC. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLots of people were interested but whereas everybody thought maybe they'd write to them, I got all the right details before the people left. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe next day I was on the phone making appointments. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoth companies I was interested in offered me a job. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI chose Saatchi, leaving school on the Friday and starting work there the following Monday. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I was only 18, they put me on their graduate programme. I suppose they saw something in me. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I loved it, the programme was very rigid, so finally I got impatient and moved instead to LBC as a 19-year-old selling radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been given Asian Hour to sell, which was pretty tough  a 4am to 5am slot, the real graveyard shift. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been handed a list of companies that spent money on advertising but who didn't advertise on radio. One was Sport Newspapers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI got through to owner David Sullivan on the phone and he wasn't interested, saying \"radio didn't work\". </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI decided I would drop off some material at his office  persistence is everything  and once I was there I decided to wait to meet him in person. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI waited and waited and waited and in the end he agreed to see me because I had waited so long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI did a very quick pitch to him and he wasn't buying it at all, so I said: \"Look, if you take the advertising and sales don't go up, you don't have to pay for it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"That sounds good to me.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI didn't have the authority to do a deal like that, so it was a risk  but I remember thinking, \"Well, if it doesn't work out, what's the worst that can happen? They can fire me but I can always get another job. I'm only 19.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI still use that kind of thinking and I have done all my life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact, it's the foundation of my confidence and my ability to take risks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt worked out. Sales went up and, within months, Sullivan was spending more than &#163;2million a year on radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI was managing it all and earning more commission than all the other sales staff put together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen he offered me a job, which I accepted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat episode is often considered to have been a turning point in my professional life but, in truth, I think my life had been heading that way since I was a young child. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Adapted by BEN JACKSON</b> <b>Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, by Karren Brady, is published by HarperCollins on March 29, &#163;18.99.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4184143/Karren-Bradysbr-football-diary.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4191942/The-Apprentice-unveiled-16-new-wannabes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Apprentice unveiled"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2614813/Karren-Brady-Im-hired.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Karren: I'm hired"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3877834/Apprentice-teens-top-the-adults.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Apprentice teens 'top the adults'"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf23bran1--532_1476008a.jpg","caption":"Driven ...

As far back as 1877 a statue of Venus de Milo was the subject of a court case when a gardener was caught trying to have sex with \"her\". </p>\n<p>\nMore recently, American Edward Smith has expressed his love for his VW Beetle, Vanilla, though he admits having \"relationships\" with many vehicles. </p>\n<p>\nHis most intense sexual experience was \"making love\" to a helicopter from the Eighties TV series Airwolf  but his major love is cars. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEdward said: \"I go a little bit beyond appreciating the beauty of a car, to the point of what I feel is an expression of love. </p>\n<p>\n\"I write poetry about cars, I sing to them and talk to them like a girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not sick. Cars are just my preference.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe told earlier this month how Leeds shop assistant Amanda Whittaker, 27, has fallen for the Statue of Liberty, or \"Libby\" as she knows her. At school she loved a drum kit. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1979, Eija-Riitta Ekl&#246;f from Sweden \"married\" the Berlin Wall. Eija, who changed her surname to Berliner-Mauer, coined the term Objectum Sexual (OS) for her unconventional orientation. </p>\n<p>\nMrs Berliner-Mauer says her \"long-distance\" relationship survived the \"tragedy\" of the wall being pulled down in 1989  but she has fallen for a red fence. Former US soldier Erika LaBrie, 41, pledged to love, honour and obey the Eiffel Tower in an intimate ceremony in Paris in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nErika Eiffel founded the Objectum Sexuality Internationale group which has more than 40 members and a website. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOther \"inanimate lovers\" revealed by objectophiles include a cartoon character, steam locomotives, words, public buildings and a hydraulic flood barrier. </p>\n<p>\nSan Francisco sexologist Dr Amy Marsh carried out a scientific survey involving 21 objectophiles and found cars, trains and aircraft are the most common objects of desire. </p>\n<p>\nBut more women than men are objectophiles and they are more likely to love structures. </p>\n<p>\nDr Marsh said: \"OS transcends fetishism and is experienced as a sexual and/ or affectionate orientation with an array of emotions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It does not seem to be caused by trauma or delusional psychiatric conditions, though it does seem linked with autism. </p>\n<p>\n\"Professionals need to learn more about OS and treat OS patients with the same respect they do for other sexual preference minorities.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information go to dramymarshsexologist.com</a>. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nm.phillips@the-sun.co.uk </a> </a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210058/Im-in-love-with-3ft-statue-of-Adonis.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I'm in love with 3ft statue of Adonis"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2322gn-5323_1476064a.jpg","caption":"Flight of fancy ...

I blamed the bad smells on the dog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nConstantly banning herself from the food she loves has made Alison's adult life a misery. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My hatred of being big has meant I have spent every day on a dieting roller coaster. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a fad diet junkie. It has become an addiction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Alison's first diet memory goes back to when she was just 13. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll never forget the anxiety I felt when a shop girl told my mum there wasn't a school dress big enough for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I squeezed into the size they had and trundled off to secondary school tugging at the hemline in embarrassment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter being called \"fatty\" in that first year at school, Alison embarked on her first diet. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum had the Scarsdale Diet book and for six weeks I had grapefruit for breakfast, protein and salad for lunch and protein and veg for tea. </p>\n<p>\n\"Although I was always starving and grumpy, I stuck to it and lost a stone over the summer holidays and hit my goal weight of 8st. </p>\n<p>\n\"Even though I wasn't as skinny as some of my friends, I was just so happy to have been accepted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as soon as Alison stopped the diet plan, she shot back up to 9st, large for her 5ft 6in frame. </p>\n<p>\nSo she was actually <b>HAPPY</b> when she contracted glandular fever at the age of 16. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost a stone effortlessly  I was thrilled. I battled to stay that size but the weight I'd lost on the 'Glandular Fever Diet' didn't stay off. </p>\n<p>\n\"As soon as the biscuit barrel was in sight, I piled on the weight.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison's obsession got worse when she found even quicker fixes. Within six months of turning 19, she had tried the Fit For Life Diet, the Egg And Grapefruit Diet and the Banana Diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I even tried the Lunch Box Diet. The idea is that you fill a lunch box up with lots of healthy food. That was great... until I started replacing the salad with chocolate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring her twenties, Alison's weight fluctuated between a healthy 9½st and 10st  but she longed to be a stone lighter again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA turning point in her dieting nightmare came when she married Frank, a photographer, now 48, in 1988 when she was 22. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost half a stone through a combination of nerves and WeightWatchers but, again, it didn't stay off. Within a year, I'd gone to almost 11st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison got desperate and started the meal replacement Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Within two months I was down to 8½st but, boy, it was hard. It was worth it though. I was slim and loving it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYo-yo dieting her way through the Eighties, Alison would spend hours researching gimmicks to keep herself below 10st  until she became pregnant for the first time in 1991. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I embraced eating for two and indulged in whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I looked massive. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was more than 14st when I gave birth to Charlie, who is now 20.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Afterwards, Alison got straight back into her fad diet cycle and spent a fortune on books and consultations to get back down to her beloved 9st. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she explains: \"Just as I hit the 10st mark, I found out I was pregnant with baby No2. </p>\n<p>\n\"Again, I ate for Britain. This time I was 13½st when I gave birth to Olivia in 1995.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce more, Alison threw herself into a host of different diets. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"You name it, I tried it. I'd feel motivated at the beginning and lose a few pounds but then I'd have a blip and pig out for a few days before embarking on another 'new' diet, telling myself this would be 'the one'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison did not manage to slim down before becoming pregnant again in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nThe cycle of gorging and dieting continued after daughter Florence was born in 2001, and Alison flitted between 11 and 12½st. </p>\n<p>\nTwo years ago, Alison's husband told her he was worried because her stomach was bigger than her bust. </p>\n<p>\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan had worked for her in the past and, amazingly, she lost three-and-a-half stone in just three months. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"At last I was 10st again. I stayed at that weight for six months by cutting out carbs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I looked great but missed bread and pasta.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut gradually the carbs slipped back on to her plate and Alison now admits: \"I'm back to 12st... oh all right, 12½st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hate being this big but I can't face another liquid replacement diet  unless the liquid is Sauvignon Blanc. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Most of all, I'm sick of knowing that if I could just eat less and exercise more, my weight would naturally decrease. Perhaps then I would finally be happy.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nALISON'S DIETS </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n1. The Scarsdale </p>\n<p>\n2.

Sian, 20, who lives with her parents in Welwyn, Kent, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdam was such a fit young man that even now it's hard to accept he died so suddenly. </p>\n<p>\nWe were enjoying a family holiday in Cyprus. Just minutes before he died, Adam had been laughing and playing water volleyball. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then he said he felt unwell. He got out and sat on the side of the pool  before suddenly collapsing head first into the water. </p>\n<p>\nMy parents and I had gone for a walk and a friend of Adam's dashed to find us. By the time we got back, Adam had been pulled out of the pool. </p>\n<p>\nAn ambulance was on its way and a nurse was desperately giving him the kiss of life, trying to restart his heart. </p>\n<p>\nNow we know Adam had had a cardiac arrest. Tragically, it was too late to save him. </p>\n<p>\nTwo post-mortems  one in Cyprus and one in the UK  confirmed he died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nFor years we believed it was something peculiar to Adam. Then two years ago Cry, The Sudden Death Charity, suggested the family should all be screened. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum Julie, 50, had heart checks first  and, astoundingly, was diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nCommonly associated with Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, it is an inherited condition that affects the heart's rhythm. A year later I too was diagnosed with it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a shock to realise this syndrome was undoubtedly responsible for Adam's death in 2004 and the deaths of many other young people. </p>\n<p>\nWe then discovered it can be picked up by a simple ECG. Had Adam been tested his death could have been prevented. </p>\n<p>\nIn July 2010 I had a mini defibrillator fitted. </p>\n<p>\nIt is terrible to think Adam's death has probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\nThat's why I believe everyone should undergo a routine heart trace at 14. If an irregular heartbeat is detected, doctors can investigate further. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nNick Dias </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ASSISTANT site manager Nick collapsed in December and has now been fitted with a pacemaker. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The 27-year-old lives with fianc&#233;e Lynsey, 25, and their children, Brooke, five, and Riley, seven months, in Radlett, Herts. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a non-smoker, who is slim and exercises regularly, I never imagined I would have a heart problem. </p>\n<p>\nBut in December last year Lynsey and I were walking Brooke to school and after bending down to get her schoolbag from Riley's pushchair I passed out. </p>\n<p>\nSeconds later I came round to find Lynsey looking very concerned. Apparently I'd fallen backwards and cracked my head on the pavement. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe assumed I'd fainted and carried on walking Brooke to school. But as we did so, Lynsey became more worried because I started talking gibberish  I kept repeating myself and asking strange questions. </p>\n<p>\nAfter dropping Brooke off, Lynsey insisted on driving me to A&amp;E at Watford General Hospital. She was worried I might have concussion. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctor said because I'd passed out, he wanted to check my heart. And I was horrified when the ECG detected a problem with the rhythm of my heart. </p>\n<p>\nTerrifyingly, the doctor said I was suffering from heart block where the electrical impulses that make the heart beat don't always reach the heart. </p>\n<p>\nI was lucky my heart had started beating again  but next time I might not be so lucky and if I wasn't treated, could have a full-blown cardiac arrest. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors have been unable to find a reason for my heart block.

Sick of her unhealthy lifestyle and size 18 waist, Linda decided to ditch booze for good. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I was stuck in a destructive routine of drinking and eating too much. </p>\n<p>\nI'd just broken up with my boyfriend and wanted to move on. I'd read about the LighterLife diet and wanted to give it a go. </p>\n<p>\nOvernight I gave up alcohol and started eating four food packs a day, containing 5-600 calories. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a complete shock to the system and the first week was really hard, but I knew it would be worth it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI used to drink a bottle of wine most nights, on Fridays I'd have work drinks and Saturdays I'd be out drinking with non-work friends. </p>\n<p>\nSundays were spent recovering. It was relentless. Drinking with clients and colleagues was part of my life and I'd got myself into really bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only after I gave it up I noticed what a big impact it had. </p>\n<p>\nNow after a work night out I'll come into the office whistling and full of energy, while my colleagues are often a step behind me. And I remember all the office gossip! </p>\n<p>\nIt's been five months now and I feel stronger, more confident and I have more energy than ever before. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from 14st 9lb to 12st, from a size 18-16 to a size 14-12  and I know I look as good as I feel. </p>\n<h1>\nLaura Coventry, 33 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDDING photographer Laura, from Glasgow, went teetotal two years ago after bingeing on boozy nights out left her with huge memory blanks. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most girls in their twenties and thirties I lived for the weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThe prospect of partying and heavy drinking got me through the working week and I'd wish away Monday to Friday. </p>\n<p>\nI drank a lot, not just a couple of glasses of wine, but enough to get seriously drunk. I just loved the euphoria and the buzz that it gave me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd suffer terrible hangovers, I'd regularly be in bed until 5pm with headaches and feeling sick, but I saw it as a price worth paying to let my inhibitions go. </p>\n<p>\nOn occasions I'd been out with friends, woken up with a shocking hangover  and realised there were huge blanks in my night out I couldn't remember. </p>\n<p>\nIt really scared me and for the first time I questioned why I was doing this to myself. I knew I had to change. </p>\n<p>\nThe first two weeks were the hardest, but I managed the first three-month goal I set myself, then extended that to six months. </p>\n<p>\nNow not one drop of booze has passed my lips since February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nSome friends want me to start going out drinking with them again and say that I've proven my point, but I'm determined not to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI have a fantastic new boyfriend now and I wake up on Mondays smiling, something which never happened before. </p>\n<p>\nI still party but I don't need alcohol to get a buzz. Life feels so much fuller and better. </p>\n<h1>\nLucy Troughton, 31 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>IT was last October when Lucy went teetotal after realising the damaging effect alcohol was having on her mood. The waitress, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI lived in London between the ages of 19 to 22 and I was out drinking socially most nights. But when I fell pregnant at 23 I didn't drink for the best part of a year. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not that I missed it but I still felt very young to be stuck at home, not out partying like I used to. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a band so drinking was almost expected of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of my friends didn't have kids so there was always someone around to go out drinking with. I soon reverted back to weekend drinking. </p>\n<p>\nI got stuck in a rut of Mondays being a write-off, like I was waiting for the day to finish the moment I woke up. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to be on form for my daughter Grace, now seven, but I was tired and only realised when it was too late that I was becoming depressed. </p>\n<p>\nIn mid-October last year I decided enough was enough and gave up alcohol completely. </p>\n<p>\nIt was, and still is, very hard. I didn't go out and became a bit of a recluse, focusing more on my music, gardening and reading. </p>\n<p>\nIt's had a huge effect and I really love the mornings now. </p>\n<p>\nI feel so clear-headed. And people often comment on how I'm 'glowing' now. </p>\n<p>\nThe idea of a glass of wine with a meal is still a temptation but it does get easier to say \"No\". </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal has taught me what I really value. And I'm happier than ever. </p>\n<h1>\nKatie Carr, 22 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BARMAID Katie from Bridlington, East Yorks, was a beer-swilling, pizza-scoffing ladette. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She went teetotal in July 2010 after binge drinking caused her to have a seizure and a new love interest persuaded her to transform her life. Katie says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTequila, sambuca, J&#228;gerbombs  I wasn't fussy. I could get through 20 pints of lager in a night. </p>\n<p>\nIn June 2010, I'd been fired from my job as a waitress for consistently turning up to work reeking of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree weeks later, I'd spent &#163;1,200 in my local pub. I put on nine stone in a year on a diet of booze and pizza, weighed 18.5st and was a size 22. I didn't wear make-up or dress girly. </p>\n<p>\nOne night in July, I was out with friends when I had a seizure in a nightclub. </p>\n<p>\nI was carried out by a bouncer and taken to hospital by ambulance. The doctor instructed me to stop drinking for six weeks while they ran tests. </p>\n<p>\nWhile I was sober, I had time to re-evaluate who I was. </p>\n<p>\nWanting to seize the day, I contacted the bouncer and asked him, \"When are you going to take me out?\". I was amazed when he said later that week. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the CT scans came back clear  I'd just drunk too much. I've not been back on the booze since and have now lost eight stone. </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal is one of the best things I've ever done. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from ladette to lady. </p>\n<h1>\nRebecca Spencer, 35 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE charity worker from Southend, Essex, went teetotal seven years ago after a charity trip shocked her into a lifestyle change. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 2003 I moved to London from Newcastle in search of a new job. </p>\n<p>\nI had a big group of friends and we used to go out every weekend and always drank a lot of vodka. It was just something we did and I didn't see it as a problem. </p>\n<p>\nIn 2005 I embarked on a charity trip with Help The Aged to India to photograph how people were rebuilding their lives after the 2004 tsunami. </p>\n<p>\nIt was the most eye-opening, inspiring and horrendous experience, all at the same time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe destruction was overpowering and having an alcoholic drink in that context seemed completely ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nThe experience changed my values and made me completely reassess myself. </p>\n<p>\nJust a few days after being in India I was in Covent Garden surrounded by young professionals knocking back drinks without a thought. </p>\n<p>\nI'd seen people with absolutely nothing and I decided to re-focus my life on the things that counted. Alcohol seemed such a self-destructive extravagance. </p>\n<p>\nAs soon as I gave up I realised I'd never even really liked the taste of alcohol  it was just the social side of it I enjoyed. </p>\n<p>\nNine months after the charity trip I fell pregnant and later had my son. </p>\n<p>\nI felt great and no part of me wanted to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI've been teetotal for seven years now and feel healthier, more energetic and have much more in my pocket  why go back? </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210389/Drink-kills-25-more-in-8-years.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Drink kills 25% more in 8 years"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4203848/Sunder-the-influence.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Sunder the influence..."}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/SNF20BOOZE--_1474058a.jpg","caption":"On the wagon ...

He likened it to when The X Factor winner Joe McElderry was robbed of the Christmas number one spot after an internet campaign to make Rage Against The Machine win. </p>\n<p>\nSimon said: \"If someone beats or competes, it means you've got to work better.

Alesha I've been after her for a long time and David I've wanted on the show for two years.\" </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC has lavished &#163;22million on The Voice and Simon blasted them for refusing to admit they are in competition with his shows. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They wanted to have a pop at BGT because it's too popular and they don't like The X Factor being as popular as it is.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he backed X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos to return  despite her sex tape shame. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I'm a hundred million per cent behind her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the latest series begins it has emerged BGT sensation Jonathan Antoine, 17, was so badly bullied about his weight that he suffered a nervous breakdown in October. </p>\n<p>\nWhen the 20-stone teenager came on stage with friend Charlotte Jaconelli, 16, Simon could be heard whispering to guest judge Carmen Electra: \"Just when you thought it can't get any worse.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as the pair performed Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's The Prayer, Jonathan's incredible opera voice won a standing ovation. </p>\n<p>\nOn last night's show Simon asked Jonathan if he would consider ditching pal Charlotte  but Jonathan valiantly refused. </p>\n<p>\nA spokesperson for mental health charity Mind welcomed the news BGT was supporting Jonathan  who is being monitored by a psychiatrist. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile Sam Kelly, 19, of Norfolk, wowed the BGT panel playing guitar and singing Adele's version of Make You Feel My Love.

Tulisa doesn't respect herself because of the way she was brought up  especially when it comes to men.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explained sadly: \"A young girl who respects herself would choose her partner very wisely. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is clearly not making the right partner choices. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is not seeking out a healthy relationship  a genuine and honourable man.\" </p>\n<p>\nMel grew close to Tulisa after her real mum Ann had a breakdown when she was just 11. </p>\n<p>\nShe fears her stepdaughter, 23, will struggle to live down the tape showing her performing a sex act on then-boyfriend Justin Edwards, 28  a wannabe rap star who calls himself MC Ultra. </p>\n<p>\nMel went on to blast whoever left Tulisa squirming by posting the footage on the internet. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I know chances are Tulisa is the victim. But she needs to stop being so careless with herself and her career. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is so talented and has the chance to make it big. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't afford for stuff to come out like this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe stepmum blamed Tulisa's broken home and her subsequent hunt for a father figure for landing herself in trouble. She said: </p>\n<p>\n\"She needs strong loving parental guidance. Unfortunately for Tulisa, her mum is not very well and she has got a father who is a distant character. </p>\n<p>\n\"I feel she is a victim of her childhood,  the classic little girl who wants her father's love. </p>\n<p>\n\"And that is because she's been desperately seeking the love and affection of men since she was a little girl. </p>\n<p>\n\"From what I can see  as someone who knows her from childhood  she is searching for someone just like her father. </p>\n<p>\n\"She needs to find someone kind, honourable and genuine. A man who comes from a proper family background and has family values.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel  now a housewife living in Hertfordshire  described the singer's relationship with her father Plato as stormy. She claimed this did not make for a happy childhood, saying: \"All Tulisa wanted was her father's love.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel wed Plato in 1999 two years after they met. The couple had moved in together in Queen's Park, North West London. </p>\n<p>\nDescribing how Tulisa was sometimes a handful, Mel said: </p>\n<p>\n\"When she was young, her role models were Charlie's Angels and the Spice Girls. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were all about empowering yourself and girl power. I said to her: 'True girl power is a strong independent woman who really likes and knows who she is.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The fans may see this very hardened, tough character who has all the tattoos  but the character that I see is the little girl that I remember.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel believes the pressure of being in a band from a young age made Tulisa grow up too quickly. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"She was sexualised from a very young age. </p>\n<p>\n\"I used to gasp at some of the things she wore as a girl. </p>\n<p>\n\"She had no one to tell her it was inappropriate to wear stomach and cleavage-baring tops when she was just developing. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always went for wild guys  the type her father hated.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTulisa took to YouTube last Wednesday to admit she was the star of the embarrassingly intimate video with ex-boyfriend Justin. </p>\n<p>\nShe had earlier denied she was the blonde performing a sex act on him in the six-minute clip. </p>\n<p>\nMel said of whoever released the tape: \"What sort of a guy does that? What you do in the bedroom is private. </p>\n<p>\n\"Who has a relationship with you and then does that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTV mogul Simon Cowell has insisted the scandal will not cost Tulisa her X Factor job as a judge on the hit ITV1 show. </p>\n<p>\nBut her stepmum said: \"She is hurting. How can anyone recover from something like this? </p>\n<p>\n\"When she meets someone in the future will they think of her as the girl who was in the sex tape? </p>\n<p>\n\"I really hope she will learn about her inner strength. </p>\n<p>\n\"She has not got to where she is now by being a softie. </p>\n<p>\n\"But she has come out of this week and she has put out a video giving her side. </p>\n<p>\n\"Not many people would have the guts or strength to do that.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\na.crick@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<h1>\nShe wants dad's love </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTULISA has been seeking love since her troubled childhood and desperately wants a man who will be a father figure to her, stepmum Mel believes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe series of touching photos below reveal moments in the early life of the girl who was to become a recording and TV star  showing her with dad Plato and N-Dubz bandmates. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4217143/Tulisa-sues-ex-lover-MC-Ultra-over-release-of-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa's sex tape gag on ex-lover"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4215256/Tulisa-Contostavlos-news-Singers-new-raunchy-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa's latest sex tape"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4210623/Tulisa-news-X-Factor-judge-claims-sex-tape-shows-her-and-ex-boyfriend-Justin-Edwards.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4205864/Tulisa-sex-tape-X-Factor-judge-is-dragged-into-storm.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa is dragged into sex vid storm"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNN2505STEP53262_1477384a.jpg","caption":"Heartbreak ...

All I want is to meet him once. Just to hear him say my name would be so cool.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nTom met Katherine, now 49, at a New York club in 1987. When Jonathan was born she took the singer to court to prove he was the dad. </p>\n<p>\nTom finally agreed to pay maintenance in 1998 when judge Judith Sheindlin  TV's Judge Judy  ordered him to take a paternity test. Even then he only publicly acknowledged Jonathan's existence in an interview in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nJonathan, who lives in America, was convinced his dad would come to see him as he grew up, and would sing his hits to his mum. He said: \"I'd lie in bed imagining doing normal stuff with him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I thought he'd walk through the door, sit down and explain to me where he'd been.

I didn't have to kiss anyone for the first six months but then it was Victoria Sugden I kissed first. </p>\n<p>\n\"You just have to prepare yourself for it and forget people are watching. </p>\n<p>\n\"I won't miss kissing blokes. I haven't got a problem with it but I don't think I'll be reminiscing!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the storylines have had their plus points, Danny admitted, as they never made his real-life girlfriend  former Emmerdale star Kirsty-Leigh Porter  jealous. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Kirsty has never got jealous because I've been kissing lads for three years. Though that could all change now. But because she's an actress she's understanding.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut things could change when Kirsty hears who Danny's dream leading lady is  and it isn't her. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It would be Angelina Jolie I think. It might be too weird working with Kirsty again!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFans of the soap will see Aaron's last appearance on Thursday, April 5. </p>\n<p>\nAnd he says they were the most emotional scenes he has ever filmed. </p>\n<p>\nHe told TV Biz: \"On my final day it was very teary-eyed because the others set me off. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's the realisation it's the last scene you're going to do there. The tears in the final scenes are real tears. You can't hold it back. The realisation I was leaving just kicked in. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll miss everyone  there is not one bad person on Emmerdale's cast or crew. I'll miss Kelvin Fletcher, who plays Andy Sugden, and Adam Thomas, who plays Adam Barton, a lot.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAaron's storylines have touched upon violence, homophobia, euthanasia and even self-harm. </p>\n<p>\nSo Danny took up running to cope with the stress. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Aaron has had an emotional rollercoaster. I have to go running and burn off the emotion at the end of the day. You have to leave the building and leave the emotion there. </p>\n<p>\n\"Crying from Monday to Friday can get draining but you have to learn to leave it behind. You have to go and get rid of it by having a run.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hardest time on Emmerdale for Danny was when producer Gavin Blyth passed away in November 2010. He died in a matter of weeks after being diagnosed with Lymphoma cancer. </p>\n<p>\nDanny said: \"Gavin's death hit everyone very hard. It was such a shock. </p>\n<p>\n\"He got cancer then a month and a bit later he just died. </p>\n<p>\n\"He was like a father figure for me. I looked up to him and he helped me play the great storylines. He nurtured me. He was a very talented young man. He was there 24/7 for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He stood by his word and he stood by me and said he'd support me and he did. We all miss him so much.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLeaving Emmerdale was a tough decision for Danny but now he wants to get into more dramas. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It was hard leaving. I could have stayed there for ever but I want to branch out. </p>\n<p>\n\"I love Sherlock  I'm the biggest fan of Benedict Cumberbatch. He's unbelievable. Gritty roles like Dominic West's as serial killer Fred West in Appropriate Adult would be a dream come true.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWorking on soaps is notoriously hard work and Danny is excited about the idea of spending more time on scenes and developing his acting. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"The likes of Pauline Quirke and people who've been in dramas  they come in and they don't know how we do it, 16 scenes a day. </p>\n<p>\n\"You've got ten hours to do all those scenes. It's a massive reality check. You don't have six hours to spend on a scene.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It annoys me when people are snobby about soaps. People come up to me and say, 'I don't watch it and its sh*t.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It's pretty disrespectful because that's my job. It's something we do day in, day out, week in week out, not like a film. </p>\n<p>\nBefore Danny auditions for any new roles he plans to get his driving licence. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It's ironic. I play a mechanic but I've been too busy to learn to drive.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut down whichever road his career takes him, Danny is thrilled to have been part of Emmerdale. </p>\n<p>\n<i>He said: \"The years have flown by. But they do say time flies when you're having fun.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/dancing_on_ice/4215095/Matthew-Wolfenden-news-Emmerdale-actor-says-hell-dedicate-Dancing-On-Ice-win-to-co-star-Charley-Webb-if-he-wins.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Matthew Wolfenden: Charley was a skate help"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/dancing_on_ice/4210522/Matthew-Wolfenden-news-Emmerdale-star-to-perform-Singing-In-The-Rain-for-Dancing-On-Ice-final.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Matthew Wolfenden is singin' in the reign"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4210181/Doctor-Who-news-Jenna-Louise-Coleman-struggled-to-keep-job-as-Matt-Smiths-assistant-secret.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jenna-Louise Coleman can breathe a sci-fi of relief"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/4203508/Emmerdale-actress-Natalie-Anderson-is-to-become-a-mum.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Baby joy for Emmerdale's Natalie Anderson"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/4191916/Emmerdale-cast-turn-rap-stars-for-Danny-Miller-leaving-party.html?iPadApp=true"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNF25DANN-532_1477200a.jpg","caption":"Emotional ...

It followed her own near-death experience when she gave birth to new daughter Hollie. </p>\n<p>\nBut show insiders last night insisted Amanda meant no offence to the Delilah singer, adding: \"She has the utmost respect for Tom.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA fierce spat erupted between the rival show's stars before they clash in a ratings war tonight. </p>\n<p>\nAmanda, 41, joins boss Cowell and fellow judges Alesha Dixon and David Walliams on the ITV1 show. </p>\n<p>\nLast night Cowell  who had been criticised by Sir Tom over his right to judge singers  hit back at the Welsh crooner's ability to pick wannabe stars. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Most artists who try and run record labels fail. That's why they are artists. Can a singer judge another singer as well as a record executive?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe music tycoon also blasted \"petty\" Beeb bosses over the scheduling clash, laying the blame firmly at their door. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They're the ones who seem to be making it into a battle. We were always going to air in March because of my timings. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"The BBC are doing this as the more they talk about us the more headlines they get. But I don't like it when the shows clashes. It is petty scheduling.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut BBC1 controller Danny Cohen played down the battle for viewers, saying: \"I'm not going to put a number on what we see as success for The Voice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday Cowell said this year's BGT will be the best ever, erasing memories of last year's uninspiring run. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"There's a mixture of good and what I call good old-fashioned British eccentricity. </p>\n<p>\n\"The best way to judge the show is not to take it too seriously, but the good ones are always going to get through and that is the important thing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>With a glint in his eye, he added: \"There will be some strippers of course  one or two.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he said there will be nine acts in the semi-final instead of eight, ensuring even more talent gets through. </p>\n<p>\nSimon, 52, also sang the praises of Walliams, 40  who rose to fame alongside Matt Lucas in BBC1 comedy Little Britain. Cowell said: \"I've been trying to get David to do this show for the past two years. There were these two bellringers last year and I texted him saying: 'It's you and Matt!'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Some of his characters on Little Britain are like some of our contestants. I thought he'd really fit into that kind of British eccentric humour. He's been a revelation.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nl.holmwood@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Big Jon's a belter </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nUNLIKELY singing duo Jonathan and Charlotte have the judges wincing when they wander on to the BGT stage  but leave to a standing ovation. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBulky Jonathan and his pretty auburn partner, who were introduced by their singing teacher, impressed all four judges with their performance. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSimon says: \"Wow, wow, wow.

At the end of the day it is always up to the viewers.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nHe added: \"With some other shows, like BGT, all kinds of talent comes on. But The Voice is purely about what people sound like  that's the unique thing.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSir Tom  on the show with fellow mentors Will.i.am, Jessie J and Danny O'Donoghue  had warmed up for tonight's ratings fight by taking a stinging swipe at Simon Cowell. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe Welsh legend insisted ITV show guru Cowell was NOT a good judge of singers because he has NEVER had a go himself. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSir Tom said: \"I have problems when people who have never got up on a stage to sing judge those who do. Who are they to say? </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"Simon Cowell is a record man, not a singer. How can someone give advice if he or she is not qualified? </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"The shows with judges from other areas of show business are all very well and good. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"But The Voice is unique because the four coaches are all singers, can all make records and know what they're talking about.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe Sex Bomb and It's Not Unusual star believes he already has five potential winners lined up.

I have never had to do that before in my life. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"When I have watched other talent shows and seen people getting all emotional, I thought that it was just showbusiness. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"But when you are there, you realise how difficult it is.

She should have been the biggest star in the world. She should have had the coolest freaking music. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's like they put them out, juice them, juice them, juice them, and give people something to watch on TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then, who is making sure she has the right material? That is wrong.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCher's album gets a US release next month but Will still reckons he will be more dedicated to helping the acts he guides on the UK version of The Voice, which kicks off tonight at 7pm. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I told every person on my team that I am going to try my hardest to see their career is jumpstarted or revitalised regardless of whether they win or not.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWill.i.am described the panel on The Voice  which also includes Tom Jones, Jessie J and The Script's Danny O'Donoghue  as like \"hungry people fighting over a steak, the fangs are drawn\". But the US producer does fear ruining a contestant's chances in the industry if he gets it wrong. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"There is a fear of that. We could mess up these people's careers.\" Will.i.am, who is pals with Cheryl Cole, who he manages, admitted he would stop at nothing to win the show but was tight-lipped about which stars he will be inviting on to the series. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I don't want to reveal my tricks. I'm just trying to do as much as I can, I swear to God, including technology and people.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe confessed that show bosses asked him and Jessie J to ramp up their banter during filming to boost ratings but both refused. Will said: \"Before the cameras went on before the first day they asked us to turn it up for TV and Jessie told me, 'I'm not going to do that for TV ratings, that's fake.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We said it to each other, then two days in the crews were like, 'Thanks a lot'  but then the banter was real.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite claiming he is mentoring four potential superstars, Will.i.am is worried about competing against \"legend\" Tom Jones because he knows every trick in the book. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I think I have about four people who are really big, out of the ten in my team  four big global artists. </p>\n<p>\n\"Out of all the singers, I am nervous about Tom's team. Me and my team, we have a lot of homework to do for the real live battles.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he reckons TV viewers will vote for the acts purely based on their voice  after the huge success of Brit Adele. </p>\n<p>\nHe claims she forced people to forget about \"the industry mould of the model figure\". </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4215256/Tulisa-Contostavlos-news-Singers-new-raunchy-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa's latest sex tape"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4213815/2Shoes-to-lose-2-stone-after-scoring-record-deal.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"2Shoes 'to lose 2 stone after scoring record deal'"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4210623/Tulisa-news-X-Factor-judge-claims-sex-tape-shows-her-and-ex-boyfriend-Justin-Edwards.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4203674/X-Factor-is-going-back-to-basics.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"X Factor is going back to basics"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/britain_got_talent/4215607/Britains-Got-Talent-news-Simon-Cowells-BGT-and-williams-The-Voice-go-head-to-head-in-the-ratings-as-shows-start.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Amanda Holden: Sir Tom could be dead in a week"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/sico-532_1476931a.jpg","caption":"Let down ...

I thought, 'Here we go... people are going to say he can't skate, he's getting his body out for the vote,' and I've had a real problem with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, after asking fans what they thought, he reluctantly agreed. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Then I thought to myself, 'Let the voting public decide.'

So I thought, 'OK, let's do it then.'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Chico has insisted on changes to the dance moves as weeks of training have left him with a bad back and a weak wrist. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I am having nightmares about it, to be honest. I have a back problem that I've got from the show and in all the weeks it had to come back  it's this week. </p>\n<p>\n\"I can't do one lift, I've had to change it because of my wrist  it's the seat lift where your hand is right up her bum! </p>\n<p>\n\"I managed to get her so far up but they wanted it travelling and turning and my wrist can't handle it so we had to change it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Chico admits he is pleased with his second routine  he is skating to Happy Days and will be dressed as The Fonz.

Things happen in the heat of the moment but if people are calm and reasonable they can be worked out.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt might have suited United if Tevez didn't play for City for the rest of the season because he is a talent who increases their attacking options.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Ferguson will be fully aware of Tevez's capabilities having worked with him at United.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe might have allowed him to leave Old Trafford but that doesn't mean he didn't rate him as a player.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe wouldn't have appreciated his carry-on when he tried to put pressure on him to give him a new contract but he will be aware of what an asset is he is on the pitch.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fact that he made such a quick impact on his return to the fold will quell any discontent the City fans might feel about his behaviour and he has a role to play in the run-in.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe might not start but he doesn't need to because he reminds me of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in his ability to get up to speed in a game almost as soon as he came on.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember that was his first game in five months and he still made his mark. Adrenaline could carry him through until the end of the season even if his fitness is not completely up to the mark.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe only reason Ferguson felt the need to have a pop at Tevez was because the mind games have started, the sure sign a title race has entered the title straight.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce Patrick Vieira said bringing back Scholes was an act of desperation, he was always going to react.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's what he does, defend his club and his players. I think he gets a buzz off it.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome sports people like Muhammad Ali and Usain Bolt thrive off being in the headlines and creating them and I think Ferguson is the same.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn years gone by, we've seen him lock horns with Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle but this is a different ball game because the challenge is right on his doorstep.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe tried to put them down as 'noisy neighbours' before but City have kept coming and got stronger and stronger.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited feel threatened, there's no doubt about that.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the past, Ferguson has got into rows with Arsene Wenger, Rafa Benitez and Kevin Keegan but the key is that his side have always been able to back him up.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited have walked the walk after he talked the talk so he hasn't been left with egg on his face.\n</p>\n<p>\nWouldn't it be a desperate irony if what he said about a former player came back to haunt him when the two sides meet on April 30?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nDon't be so Kean\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<h2>\nSTEVE KEAN is getting a lot of plaudits right now  and, on the face of it, things have taken a turn for the better at Blackburn Rovers.\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThree months ago, Blackburn were rooted to the foot of the table and the local paper and MP had both called on him to quit.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's not to mention the fans whose opposition was so aggressive that he had hired a bodyguard.\n</p>\n<p>\nThings have improved a bit in the meantime.\n</p>\n<p>\nA run of five wins and three draws in 12 games has seen them climb off the foot of the table to 16th.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey are a full five points clear of the relegation zone and seem to have a bit of momentum that other sides have lacked. That is despite having to work under difficult circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\nHis best player, Chris Samba, decided he did not want to play and was sold to Russian side Anzi after the English transfer window shut.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut can we actually say he is doing well just because they are no longer in the bottom three?\n</p>\n<p>\nTo me, it looks like Kean might be helped by the fact that other sides are not as competitive as in previous years.\n</p>\n<p>\nWolves and Wigan have taken just 22 points and Bolton only a point more. At the same stage last season, the bottom three  Wigan, Wolves and West Ham  had 27, 29 and 31 points respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is more a case of them not doing as badly as other teams.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd because he started off with people having such a low opinion of him, it seems like he is a no-lose situation.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Blackburn do badly, people did not expect anything else and if they do OK, it's a bonus.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill, not many would have expected him to turn it around as he has, so all credit to him for that.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4213720/Alex-Ferguson-Man-Utd-have-plenty-of-ammunition-for-Man-City.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Mancini's desperate"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/fergie_1476810a.jpg","caption":"USED CAR ...

He has everything you need, I'm sure he has a bright future for Arsenal and England. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"He's shown that already in a couple of games. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He has pace, he is clever, knows when to pass, when to keep the ball and has good technique. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"He's a bit like Rooney, who I rate highly. Rooney's a big player and a good all-rounder who can score goals, provide assists and make nice runs  he has a bit of everything. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"And although Alex plays on the left or right  whereas Rooney plays more through the middle  that could change in the future. They are both good all-round players.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nVan Persie is the man currently firing the Gunners to glory. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis season has been his best in an Arsenal shirt with 33 goals to his name already but the 28-year-old Holland ace credits his team-mates and Wenger for making his scoring heroics possible. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"I've been working with Arsene Wenger for eight years now and he's been a big influence on me, together with the team and the club. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"That's everyone from the kitman to the manager  they all help each other. Lots of my achievements are down to the rest of the players because, without them, I'm nothing. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not doing anything differently  I still love to play football and train but for the last 18 months I've been able to play week in, week out. You can see the results. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Hopefully, I can stay in this form and keep it going.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nVan Persie's scoring exploits have made him a frontrunner with bookies for this season's Player-of-the-Year accolade. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut he joked: \"I've paid them off! We'll see. It would be special if I was picked as a candidate but that's for later.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>ROBIN VAN PERSIE was helping film the new Mars advert for their 'Play Your Part for England' campaign.

And Toure declared: \"It's important not to panic. It is always difficult to play Stoke and the important thing is to work hard and believe in ourselves.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"We didn't deserve more than a draw today  Stoke played well.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"We gave ourselves problems, but it's important to keep going and wait until Monday, to see what United do.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis brother Kolo added: \"It's always difficult here. We are disappointed to have dropped two points but it's still a good result. Every point is valuable.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCrouch's goal will live long in the memory as he teed up the ball with his right foot and delivered an incredible angled volley from wide outside the area.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I knew as soon as it left my foot I had a good chance. I was really pleased with the manner of the goal, it has to be up there with one of the best I've scored.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"I always enjoy volleying the ball in training but I don't get many like that.

I'm in a lot of pain right now'.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I just didn't believe him and it wasn't until I was leaving the stadium and was asked to do an interview that I realised it was true.

I was always with the older lads but I didn't feel shy around them or inferior. I wasn't scared playing against them. I just wanted to prove myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Even then I wanted to be the best I could be. I was always trying to improve, to learn.

So you have to persevere, believe and work as hard as you can to change what you are going through, to stay grounded and fully focused.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is especially true amid the inevitable uncertainty when you do not have a permanent manager at either club or country.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Yes, it's a strange feeling. But it comes with the territory, it's part of football, part of life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You just try to move forward as a group, whether it's with England or Chelsea.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBy moving on, he actually means aiming for the stars with the Blues and the Three Lions.\n</p>\n<p>\nChelsea are chasing the Champions League, FA Cup and a top-four finish, ensuring a dramatic climax to the season.

As the rain continued to hammer down, he was due to come into the pits to swap on to the wet tyres.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, while his pit crew were getting his new tyres ready, he spun off as his lost traction on lap five and ended in the kitty litter without having made it back to the pits.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was incredibly unfortunate for Grosjean, who had given another solid performance in qualifying.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the conditions took another turn for the worst, Button decided to come in for the wets having seen Ferrari's Felipe Massa benefit from the new tyres.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHamilton followed suit, despite lasting another lap on the intermediates, before the rain became too heavy.\n</p>\n<p>\nButton complained on this team radio that circuit was becoming too dangerous and said: \"The last sector is like a lake\".\n</p>\n<p>\nTwo bolts of lightning and a rumble of thunder seemed to rattle the race stewards, who quickly sent out the safety car on lap eight.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut even under the safety car, the conditions were becoming too dangerous and at the end of lap nine the race was red flagged.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a delay of 51 minutes, the race resumed under the safety car for four more laps before it returned to normal conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut it proved to be a nightmare restart for McLaren. First, Hamilton had a slow pitstop as the mechanic struggled with the rear jack.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was then forced to wait behind Massa as Perez and Alonso took advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was even worse news for Button on lap 15 as he collided with the HRT of Narain Karthikeyan on turn nine and lost his front wing.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo add insult to injury he suffered punctures in his front tyres which forced him to make another pitstop.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was another slow pitstop from McLaren, which dropped the Australian GP winner down to 21st place.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile Button was struggling, Ferrari's Alonso was able to set about building his lead over Sauber's Perez.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Mexican has been linked with replacing Massa at Ferrari at the end of the season and gave added weight to his reputation with a number of quick laps.\n</p>\n<p>\nMassa was having a difficult time, despite using the team's new chassis, as he made a poor mistake that allowed Paul Di Resta through.\n</p>\n<p>\nButton was clearly furious at seeing his chances of winning wiped out and he took out his frustration, as he started ruthlessly cutting his way through the pack.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe pulled a brilliant move on the beleaguered Massa before being granted his wish to switch to the medium compound slick tyres.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as Hamilton went in to make his stop for the slicks, a mechanic struggled to remove some sticky tape on his brake duct, which cost him even more time.\n</p>\n<p>\nPerez continued to push Alonso to make for a thrilling final eight laps until he ran wide and gave his opponent more breathing space.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was even more drama as reigning champion Sebastian Vettel suffered a puncture while he was in fourth place when he caught the front wing of Karthikeyan.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe subsequent pitstop and a KERS problem meant that he had to settle for 11th place.\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"FALSE START ...

And when the news of Bolton's victory finally filtered through to Bethnal Green, I'm sure it would have meant the world to him. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTo know there was a little light at the end of the tunnel in his club's own fight for survival. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNo doubt, he was kicking every ball. And, as best he could, joining in the applause. </p>\n<p>\nAnd so everyone connected with Bolton finally got on with life yesterday. It was a day when even the sun came out for 23-year-old Muamba. </p>\n<p>\nThe Reebok is not known for the clemency of its weather. </p>\n<p>\nSituated as it is underneath the aptly-named Winter Hill, it's one of the bleakest spots in the country, chill winds invading the very marrow of your bones. </p>\n<p>\nYesterday, though, it was bathed in sunshine. Suddenly, we were in Bolton-sur-mer. Smiling faces all round, girls in shorts and fans from both clubs gathered to see their teams do exactly as Muamba had wished  to get on with the game. </p>\n<p>\nOutside the stadium, they read the messages of support. </p>\n<p>\nOn the ground outside the main reception area, there were shirts from probably every club in the land. And all with the same message. </p>\n<p>\nGet well soon, Fabrice. Keep fighting. We're thinking of you. </p>\n<p>\nStrangely, there was a sign on the wall saying In Remembrance. </p>\n<p>\nThankfully, this is not the case for young Fabrice, following his near-miraculous and ongoing recovery after his heart effectively stopped for 78 minutes last weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThere were further tributes to a player referred to as Lionheart. And an England shirt with the words Bulldog Spirit. </p>\n<p>\nAll very British and gung-ho. </p>\n<p>\nExcept Muamba is far from your average football player. He is a one-off, a man of his own making. </p>\n<p>\nIt takes a special person to arrive at a tender age from a country at war like the Congo and settle as well as he did. </p>\n<p>\nTo learn a foreign language in quick time and go on to pass three A levels. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the whole time making an impression on the football pitch. Everyone has talked of what a delight Muamba is, considerate, patient and without a trace of conceit or envy. </p>\n<p>\nHow he has a kind word for everyone. </p>\n<p>\nAnd also the time to take an Open University course in accountancy and attend church every Sunday. </p>\n<p>\nAs I said, far removed from the public perception of a Premier League footballer. </p>\n<p>\nThis, more than anything, is why we had a packed Reebok yesterday. Some 26,901, the biggest crowd of the season. </p>\n<p>\nThey had come to cheer their team and also say thank you. Thank you for Muamba being spared. And thank you for that rarity  a gentleman in sport. With the emphasis on 'gentle'. </p>\n<p>\nAs the players walked out, we were supposed to start our minute's applause. But it had already started. </p>\n<p>\nAnd prompted, fair play to them, by the chants of \"Fabrice Muamba\" from the visiting fans. </p>\n<p>\nAs the applause continued, fans in the sun-drenched East Stand held up cards spelling \"Muamba 6\". </p>\n<p>\nHigh to their right, the big screen recalled highlights of his career. And still the applause rang out. Then it was down to the other business of the day. And even there the sun radiated down on Bolton. </p>\n<p>\nDavid Wheater powered home one header after 28 minutes, then another seven minutes later. And all was well with the world. </p>\n<p>\nThe name of the absent hero once again reverberated round the stadium. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, these things never quite work to script. So we had Blackburn's Steven Nzonzi pulling one back with over half an hour left and high anxiety gripping the home fans. </p>\n<p>\nThen, after a seeming eternity, a blast on referee Andre Marriner's whistle announced it was over and Bolton were out of the bottom three. </p>\n<p>\nYes, salvation may still be some way off. </p>\n<p>\nBut for Bolton and Fabrice Muamba, yesterday was another good day on the road to recovery. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nsteven.howard@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4216527/Bolton-2-Blackburn-1-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Bolton 2 Blackburn 1"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214991/Nigel-Reo-Coker-says-Fabrice-Muamba-opened-his-eyes-and-said-All-right-Nige.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fab opened his eyes, saw me and said: 'All right, Nige..?'"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214099/Owen-Coyle-Fabrice-Muambas-recovery-from-collapse-can-inspire-Bolton.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Owen: Muamba can inspire us"}],"video":[{"uri":"MyYmE5NDpAo1vpl3rM7gCwX9iCERsK_c","caption":"OWEN COYLE reveals ill Bolton star sent good luck note to team-mates"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton1_840x420_1477348a.jpg","caption":"SHOW OF SUPPORT ... fans spell out Fabrice Muamba's name in card tribute ahead of kick-off yesterday"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton5_532x780_1477353a.jpg","caption":"FRONT MAN ... matchday programme"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton4_23_532x_1477352a.jpg","caption":"SPUR-FECT ... supporters thank Tottenham"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton3_23_532x_1477350a.jpg","caption":"PICTURE POWER ... young fans hail Fab"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton7_22_532x_1477360a.jpg","caption":"COME BOK SOON ... tributes outside the Reebok"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton2_22_532x_1477349a.jpg","caption":"LORD'S PRAYER ... supporter gives thanks"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton6_22_532x_1477356a.jpg","caption":"KIT OF ALL RIGHT ... youngster wears Fab jersey"}]},"isArticle":true},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"TIGHT AT THE TOP ...

The injured Sergio Aguero was replaced by Edin Dzeko and Carlos Tevez was again on the bench but the visitors did control the early possession. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was not until the ninth minute that Gael Clichy found space to deliver a ball into the Stoke box but Asmir Begovic claimed easily. </p>\n<p>\nStoke had their first opening after a free-kick was crossed to the back post for Crouch but Cameron Jerome was unable to turn his downward header goalwards. </p>\n<p>\nAt the other end, David Silva and Pablo Zabaleta both had efforts deflected wide and Yaya Toure shot over from distance. </p>\n<p>\nDean Whitehead was given a talking to by referee Howard Webb after catching Silva with his arm challenging for a high ball, with play held up while the Spaniard received treatment. </p>\n<p>\nStoke almost took the lead in the 41st minute when a Matthew Etherington corner was met by a deft glancing header from Ryan Shawcross but Pablo Zabaleta cleared off the line. </p>\n<p>\nMario Balotelli broke through as the first half went into injury time but shot tamely at Begovic. </p>\n<p>\nDzeko had a chance to break the deadlock in the opening minute of the second half as he controlled a lofted pass from Barry, but he could not get it down quick enough to round Begovic. </p>\n<p>\nCameron Jerome was replaced by Jermaine Pennant in the 51st minute and Hart was forced to block an effort from Walters at point-blank range. </p>\n<p>\nStoke claimed the lead with a sensational strike from Crouch just before the hour. </p>\n<p>\nA long clearance from Begovic was headed on by the lanky front man, before he took the return from Pennant, flicked it up and twisted to volley over Hart and into the top corner. </p>\n<p>\nMancini reacted by sending on Adam Johnson for Silva and then Tevez for Barry in the hope of gaining more width. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Yaya Toure from a central position - a non-threatening 35 yards out - who sledgehammered in the equaliser. </p>\n<p>\nThe Ivorian's firecracker caught the head of Shawcross and it was enough to wrong-foot Begovic and slam into the net. </p>\n<p>\nPulis introduced Wilson Palacios in place of Etherington to shore up his side and Shawcross came close with a header that looped agonisingly over. </p>\n<p>\nYaya Toure came close at the death but another powerful effort from the all-action midfielder flew just over the top. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/crouch2_1477285a.jpg","caption":"PETER'S PERFECT ...

and halted Blackburn's revival. </p>\n<p>\nSteven Nzonzi nodded Rovers' consolation in a contest charged with feeling as it was Bolton;s first match since Fabrice Muamba's collapse last weekend. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStBolton manager Owen Coyle named an unchanged line-up from his side's last Premier League game as the Lancashire side aimed to put the emotion generated by Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest last week to one side against Blackburn at the Reebok Stadium. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith Muamba still in intensive care, none of Coyle's players took up the option of sitting the game out, instead committing themselves to try and gain three valuable points in pursuit of top-flight safety. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn have adopted a respectful tone in the build-up, but Steve Kean's men were chasing a third successive win and were also unchanged. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Bolton supporters applauded from the moment the montage of Muamba began, right through until the handshake, a stand full of placards reading 'Muamba 6' held up opposite the directors' box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was soon evident the Bolton fans would be in full voice and Mark Davies fed David Ngog, whose cross was scrambled out of the Rovers penalty area. </p>\n<p>\nMartin Petrov was inches away from finding Ngog with an intelligent through-ball that ended up running on to Paul Robinson. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov let fly himself a couple of minutes later and Robinson had to watch the ball carefully in flight before beating it away. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere was little doubt Petrov was keen to make an impression and the Bulgarian shrugged Jason Lowe off the ball rather too easily, only to roll a disappointing shot wide of the far post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton keeper Adam Bogdan was thankful Davies was on hand to clear after he dropped Robinson's deep free-kick in a packed penalty area. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNgog got his head to a Petrov cross at the other end, but his effort lacked power and Robinson gathered with ease. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson's diving header turned Petrov's deep cross away for a corner, which Bolton could make nothing of. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn should have had a penalty when in-form striker Junior Hoilett went charging into the box and was nudged over by Gretar Steinsson. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTV replays showed there had been contact with the man, and none with the ball, but referee Andre Marriner waved play on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton were indebted to Tim Ream, who slid in to ensure Yakubu did not get on the end of a Marcus Olsson cross that looked like presenting him with a tap-in. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd they immediately profited when Petrov crossed from the right and Steven Nzonzi only succeeded in flicking it on to David Wheater, who seemed as surprised as anyone when the ball ended up in the bottom corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPratley was just off target as Bolton tried to press home their advantage, although Yakubu was inches away from equalising as he rose to meet Olsson's cross with a powerful header that just went wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov's shot was touched behind by Robinson, which only offered Bolton the chance to cause more damage from the corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd this time there was no look of surprise as Wheater profited from Ryo Miyaichi's cross to power home his second. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBogdan did not pay the penalty for yet more poor handling and not long afterwards Scott Dann's diving far-post header landed in the side-netting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson needed treatment within seconds of the re-start after he was caught from behind by Miyaichi. </p>\n<p>\nThe full-back was able to continue, although as he was ushered back on to the field Miyaichi curled narrowly over for Bolton. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWheater cleared after some slack play from Nigel Reo-Coker had almost put them in trouble and from the throw-in, Bogdan came to collect Nzonzi's back header. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNgog was close to a third for Bolton at the other end as he rose to meet Petrov's inswinging cross. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nDavies completely mis-kicked as he was presented with a shooting chance just outside the box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd Bolton were made to pay as Bogdan failed to shift Yakubu from his line of vision until it was far too late as the hosts attempted to defend Morten Gamst Pedersen's corner and Nzonzi took advantage to nod home. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was breathless stuff and Davies should have restored Bolton's two-goal cushion when Miyaichi picked him out from the right, completely unmarked, six yards out. Somehow though, he glanced the header wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson barged Steinsson off the ball by the corner flag but Hoilett let the pull-back run under his foot. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBogdan needed treatment after taking a thud in the ribs from Yakubu. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn the meantime, David Dunn was introduced for Mauro Formica. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhen play began again, Davies carved out an excellent opportunity for Petrov, but his shot nearly struck the corner flag it was so far wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIvan Klasnic replaced Ngog 11 minutes from time as Petrov waited to take a corner which he eventually dropped on to Pratley's head. But he was off target too. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYakubu bundled Hoilett's near-post cross just the wrong side of the post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn were now looking to take advantage of Bolton's anxiety and Yakubu was not far away with a close-range header two minutes from time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214994/Steve-Kean-Dont-be-embarrassed-beating-Bolton-lads.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Steve is Kean to be mean"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214925/Karren-Bradys-football-diary.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Karren Brady's football diary"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214991/Nigel-Reo-Coker-says-Fabrice-Muamba-opened-his-eyes-and-said-All-right-Nige.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fab opened his eyes, saw me and said: 'All right, Nige..?'"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/wheater3_1477183a.jpg","caption":"GRET IN THERE! ...

+0000","articlebody":"<p>\nCHELSEA missed the chance to move to within two points of Spurs in the race for the Champions League places after a stalemate at Stamford Bridge. </p>\n<p>\nIn a boring first half only Rafael van der Vaart came close to scoring but his double chance was saved by Petr Cech and then blocked by Ashley Cole. </p>\n<p>\nJuan Mata hit the post with a free-kick after the break as the Blues pressed for a much-needed win. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Tottenham who came closest to nicking victory through William Gallas, Emmanuel Adebayor and then Gareth Bale who crashed a header against the bar. </p>\n<p>\nBale again tested Cech with a dipping last-minute free-kick but it was to remain goalless  a result which suits Spurs more than the Blues. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFernando Torres was back on the bench as Didier Drogba returned to the Chelsea starting line-up. </p>\n<p>\nBut that change did little to ignite a surprisingly cagey opening. </p>\n<p>\nThe hosts looked the more threatening but any danger was well snuffed out by a Spurs defence without skipper Ledley King. </p>\n<p>\nScott Parker was his usual industrious self while Sandro was providing an effective shield in an unusually advanced role. </p>\n<p>\nBut in what has been such an exciting Premier League season the opening half of this London derby was a bore. </p>\n<p>\nDespite the Blues in desperate need for three points to close the gap on fourth-placed Spurs, both teams seemed too scared to lose. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nChelsea did have a half-hearted penalty appeal when Frank Lampard broke in the box and went tumbling under a challenge by WGallas but Martin Atkinson rightly waved play on. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Stamford Bridge had to wait until first-half injury time for the first real goalmouth action as Bale played in a neat ball to Luka Modric. </p>\n<p>\nHis deflected pull back found Van der Vaart ten yards out but the ball fell awkwardly on the Dutchman's right foot and he struck straight at Cech. </p>\n<p>\nCole then reacted quickly to block Van der Vaart's follow up and as the ball looped in the air, Adebayor could only head on to the roof of the net. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThings livened up a tad immediately after the break and Daniel Sturridge should have done better after Drogba headed him clear but he dragged his left-footed strike wide. </p>\n<p>\nAt the other end, Kyle Walker had Cech worried with a fierce right-footed drive after a lovely reverse pass by Bale but his effort crashed into the side of the net. </p>\n<p>\nRamires was up in arms after a coming together with Benoit Assou-Ekotto but Atkinson was again right to ignore the weakest of penalty claims. </p>\n<p>\nBoth sides were beginning to press forward with more purpose without either seriously threatening to get an opening goal. </p>\n<p>\nThat was until Juan Mata stepped up with a beautiful curling free-kick which had Brad Friedel beaten but struck his left post and bounced clear. </p>\n<p>\nThen Spurs  having hardly threatened all game  had three glorious chances which all went begging. </p>\n<p>\nFirst William Gallas headed over with a free header from a teasing Modric free-kick. </p>\n<p>\nThen Adebayor latched on to a Modric dink but he lost his balance after rounding Cech and Gary Cahill was back to clear his strike at an empty net. </p>\n<p>\nThe visitors were then cursing their luck as Bale crashed a header from a corner smack on to the bar and Adebayor again headed the rebound over. </p>\n<p>\nLampard tested his luck at the other end with a strike from distance as Chelsea ran out of ideas. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Bale again who came closest with a last-minute free-kick which had Cech scrambling to save and secure at least a point for his side. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM

Arteta struck his effort into the wall. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn the hour, a quick thrown out by Wojciech Szczesny sent away Czech midfielder Rosicky, who fed Gervinho down the left, but his cut-back from the byline flew across the six-yard box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRosicky was central to the action now, with Given beating away his 25-yard drive. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn 65 minutes, Heskey was replaced by Weimann. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal soon made a double change as Ramsey and full-back Andre Santos came on for Gervinho and Gibbs. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Brazilian's first contribution on his return to action from a broken ankle was to give the ball away to Weimann, but the Austrian lost composure in the Arsenal box and fluffed his big chance, stabbing across goal and wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRamsey made space for a shot on the turn from the edge of the penalty area, but was just wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith 13 minutes left, Walcott was replaced - to a standing ovation - by Oxlade-Chamberlain, while for Villa, Alan Hutton came off and Eric Lichaj went into the overworked defence. </p><p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal were screaming for a penalty when Oxlade-Chamberlain scampered away down the right and went down under a sliding challenge from Stephen Ireland, but referee Phil Dowd correctly ruled the midfielder had just got the ball first. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArteta cracked home a 25-yard free-kick in stoppage time to round off a fine afternoon's work from Wenger's reborn side. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal: Szczesny, Sagna, Djourou, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Gervinho, van Persie.

With temperatures way up in the 90s Sri Lanka is like an oven.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's why SunSport columnist Graeme Swann has come up with his own six hit to make things bearable for England's tourists.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1) LAUGH A MINUTE </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMickey-taking and banter keeps spirits up. Tim Bresnan is a soft target as he never stops saying daft things. We were playing 20 Questions the other night and my secret person for people to guess was Alfred Nobel.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn that wonderful Yorkshire accent, Bressie protested: \"That's roobish. Can't have him  nobody's heard of him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"Surely you've heard of the Nobel Prize, Bressie?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But it's not a person, is it?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's typical Bres. On day one when it was 45 degrees in the shade he said: \"It's no different from Yorkshire, is this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery day now you hear people shouting at him: \"Is this like Keighley, mate?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2) TOP NOSH </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy maxim is usually to eat what the locals eat. They know how to cook curries and so on. I've never been worried about eating something spicy and I've been lucky with how few upset tummies I've had. Alastair Cook led me down a dark little back alley the other night.\n</p>\n<p>\nI thought he was taking to have me bumped off  but he showed me an amazing sushi restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3) XBOX EXCELLENCE </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 all the time on the Xbox. We're in teams  Broady and me against Bres and Jimmy Anderson. Broady's the best, so I nabbed him as my partner.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome of the lads play the FIFA football game. I'm the world's worst but I was playing Bres and secretly passed the console to Finny, who is brilliant.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo Newcastle suddenly started thrashing Leeds. At the end, I just said: \"Cheers, Bres.\" He still doesn't know it was Finny operating the controls.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4) HOME COMFORTS </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe toughest part is being away from my family. Sarah and I have a little lad called Wilf, who is one.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe's just started pushing himself along with his walker. I fear I'll miss his first steps so I'm desperately hoping he can wait another couple of weeks!\n</p>\n<p>\nSkype helps. He recognises me and he runs over to the screen  says \"Da, da, da\"  and runs off again!\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5) TOON LOON </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHotels show Prem matches. I saw Newcastle trounce Norwich 1-0 the other night!\n</p>\n<p>\nAlan Pardew has built a cracking team. Paul Collingwood is big Mackem but he's not around these days so there's nobody to gloat over when we win.\n</p>\n<p>\nKevin Pietersen goes on about Chelsea but he's not a great football fan. Jimmy is half-Arsenal and half-Burnley and has started shouting more about Arsenal recently  I wonder why. Broady could hardly contain himself when Forest beat Leeds 7-3.\n</p>\n<p>\nPoor Bressie. You've guessed it  he's a Leeds fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6) CULTURE VULTURE </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe're encouraged to rest and not spend much extra time in the sun. But I like sightseeing and exploring local culture.\n</p>\n<p>\nWandering the streets can be fun but absolutely manic as everyone loves cricket.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4216473/James-Anderson-says-England-are-lucky-to-still-be-No1-in-the-world.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"James reign cloud"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4213670/Kevin-Pietersen-Pakistan-trio-deserve-bans-for-spot-fixing.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"KP: What Pakistan trio did was inexcusable"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4214849/Kevin-Pietersen-wants-fix-cheats-thrown-out-for-good.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Ban 'em for life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4212473/Ravi-Bopara-injury-blows-Englands-Test-plans-apart.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Ravi injury rocks England plans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4211604/Matt-Prior-smashes-England-to-strong-win.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Prior smashes England to strong win"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4211340/ICC-Mohammad-Amir-must-focus-on-rehabilitation-first.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Amir must focus on rehabilitation"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/65_swann_1477110a.jpg","caption":"HOT STUFF ...
