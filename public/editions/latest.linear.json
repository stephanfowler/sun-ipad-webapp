That area is renowned for having fog, there's a lot of low-lying land. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was quite horrendous at the time, and then it cleared. Whether the fog was a contributory thing, I don't know.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe bus seemed to have been hit from the rear and was leaning virtually intact against a crash barrier, he added. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nArtwork on the side of the bus shows Laurel and Hardy with the words \"This is another fine bus you've gotten me into\" - a reference to the comedy duo's famous catchphrase. </p>\n<p>\nIt is branded with the livery of bus company Stagecoach, but the vehicle had been sold by the company to a dealer 18 months ago.

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

Alesha I've been after her for a long time and David I've wanted on the show for two years.\" </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC has lavished &#163;22million on The Voice and Simon blasted them for refusing to admit they are in competition with his shows. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They wanted to have a pop at BGT because it's too popular and they don't like The X Factor being as popular as it is.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he backed X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos to return  despite her sex tape shame. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I'm a hundred million per cent behind her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the latest series begins it has emerged BGT sensation Jonathan Antoine, 17, was so badly bullied about his weight that he suffered a nervous breakdown in October. </p>\n<p>\nWhen the 20-stone teenager came on stage with friend Charlotte Jaconelli, 16, Simon could be heard whispering to guest judge Carmen Electra: \"Just when you thought it can't get any worse.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as the pair performed Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's The Prayer, Jonathan's incredible opera voice won a standing ovation. </p>\n<p>\nOn last night's show Simon asked Jonathan if he would consider ditching pal Charlotte  but Jonathan valiantly refused. </p>\n<p>\nA spokesperson for mental health charity Mind welcomed the news BGT was supporting Jonathan  who is being monitored by a psychiatrist. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile Sam Kelly, 19, of Norfolk, wowed the BGT panel playing guitar and singing Adele's version of Make You Feel My Love. Simon told him: \"I've got to tell you Sam, when you've got absolute silence in a room like this, you've nailed it.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nj.blackburn@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\"></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By JEN BLACKBURN, TV Reporter </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"IT'S all about The Voice,\" boomed Sir Tom Jones as the BBC's glossy new &#163;22million show set out to prove that it doesn't matter what you look like, as long as you can sing. </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC's X Factor alternative was brilliant, even if the judges spent more time boasting than judging. </p>\n<p>\nBut for my money it was a warm-up act for Britain's Got Talent, which has been revitalised by the addition of Alesha Dixon and a very cheeky David Walliams. </p>\n<p>\nBeeb bosses seriously underestimated the cunning Simon Cowell, never short of a spanner to throw into the works. </p>\n<p>\nBGT proved it still had plenty to offer as it closed with 20-stone teen Jonathan Antoine shuffling on  and showcasing his incredible talent. </p>\n<p>\nBut the biggest winners are the viewers, who now have months of brilliant Saturday night telly. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nAlesha's all smiles </h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nALESHA Dixon says she is having more fun on Britain's Got Talent than she did on Strictly. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAfter three years as a judge on the BBC dance show, Alesha made the move to ITV after a big-money offer from Simon Cowell  and is sure it was a good call. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe 33-year-old said: \"It's been brilliant.

All I want is to meet him once. Just to hear him say my name would be so cool.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nTom met Katherine, now 49, at a New York club in 1987. When Jonathan was born she took the singer to court to prove he was the dad. </p>\n<p>\nTom finally agreed to pay maintenance in 1998 when judge Judith Sheindlin  TV's Judge Judy  ordered him to take a paternity test. Even then he only publicly acknowledged Jonathan's existence in an interview in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nJonathan, who lives in America, was convinced his dad would come to see him as he grew up, and would sing his hits to his mum. He said: \"I'd lie in bed imagining doing normal stuff with him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I thought he'd walk through the door, sit down and explain to me where he'd been. When I asked her, 'Where is he?' she'd tell me, 'He's an entertainer. He's busy. He can't be here right now'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'd see him on TV and that made me feel better. I'd think, 'She's right.

The world is so full of entertainment now, isn't it? So there are a lot of nerves. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's amazing to be back in music. I like the intimacy of a recording studio and song-writing. I'm using a different part of my brain when I work on music versus when I'm directing a film. </p>\n<p>\n\"There are a billion more people on a film and I don't have that visceral outlet of being able to sing, scream... jump around. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's very different. I love doing both but it was nice to have the simplicity of song-writing after three years of writing a script and directing and editing and talking about my film, to sit down and play my guitar and sing a song. I almost cried.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHer last studio album, Hard Candy in May 2008, experimented with a hip-hop influence. She collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and Timbaland. </p>\n<p>\nThe album reached No1 around the world but received a lukewarm reception from some fans and critics. </p>\n<p>\nMDNA, a \"triple entendre\" as she describes it, is a return to what she does best: classic pop songs with a sprinkling of trademark controversy. </p>\n<p>\n<i>And it is down to the return of her winning formula: working with top European producers.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nStuart Price produced some of her best original material on Confessions On A Dancefloor back in 2005. She also made some great material with French electronic guru Mirwais. </p>\n<p>\nBut her return to the studio with producer William Orbit, who made Ray Of Light back in 1998, is a master stroke. </p>\n<p>\nThe tracks they have made together on the new album, including Gang Bang and Some Girls, slot into her discography perfectly. </p>\n<p>\nShe has also employed the skills of Martin Solveig, Italian DJ Benny Benassi and his cousin Allessandro. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Madonna believes her return to Europe for her producing partners is no coincidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I think maybe I just have more of a European sensibility. People say that about my songs as well. I like working with people who are well-read and know what's going on in the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"Conversation is essential. With William, we always get into discussions about philosophy or quantum physics. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"With Martin Solveig we always end up getting in to discussions about foreign films. When I'm working with people I can't just write music, I have to be able to talk about life and the world, and art. Benny was a tricky one because he doesn't speak English very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was a little bit frustrating at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they're not. </p>\n<p>\n\"When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well. </p>\n<p>\n\"Martin is such good fun, I adore him. You have to feel like you can say 'No, I don't like that,' and you're not going to hurt their feelings. And vice versa. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he's got just the right balance of seriousness and humour. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe production on the album is slick, with some great touches. </p>\n<p>\nOn Gang Bang the noise of a spent cartridge from a gun hitting a concrete floor illustrates her \"Kill Bill\" fantasy for the track. </p>\n<p>\nBut the contrast of a huge pop track like Superstar, featuring her daughter Lourdes on backing vocals, is followed up with a song called Falling Free  one of her most stripped-back songs for years. She explained: \"I have to be completely involved in the production. I like the contrast. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to have something that is just slammed with noise and sound and bass and drum, sensory overload and then create something like Falling Free, which is stripped back and all you can really hear is my voice and the lyrics. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes I sit down on a guitar and start strumming chords and things come out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Sometimes people bring a song to me that has a title, for instance, or an idea of a lyric and I take it and kind of re-shape it, re-word it and make it my own. It comes in so many different ways, it's always been that way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe album features some big collaborations with strong female solo stars  M.I.A and rapper Nicki Minaj. Give Me All Your Luvin' was the Superbowl song that ended up causing controversy when M.I.A decided to stick up her middle fin ger. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But that punk spirit is exactly why she got them on board.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was looking to collaborate with women who I think have a strong sense of themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were a lot of fun to be around in the studio, for sure. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think we were all shy of each other in the beginning, that's just human nature. </p>\n<p>\n\"I think we got over that pretty quickly. </p>\n<p>\n\"They're both very self-possessed people, especially M.I.A. I don't think she's impressed much by stars and celebrities, so we just got down to business. I loved her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the key to keeping the music original? Don't listen to chart music while you are writing. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I wasn't listening to anything to tell you the truth, when I wrote this. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was working on the soundtrack to my movie W.E. So just classical music. I actually don't like listening to pop music while I'm working on pop music  it doesn't really work. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"You don't want to hear other people's stuff, you need a clean slate to work off.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/music/4212157/Be-the-first-to-hear-Madonnas-new-album.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Be the first to hear Madonna's new album"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4208747/Madonna-writhes-around-with-topless-dancers-in-video-to-Girl-Gone-Wild.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Madonna has a buff time in her new video"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4185811/Madonna-on-her-family-life.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4185666/Madonna-is-singing-brthe-bruisebr.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/music/4179490/Madonna-rolls-back-the-years-on-MDNA.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Madonna rolls back the years on new album"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/madonna2-532_1476109a.jpg","caption":"Intelligent conversation ...

We saw his horrifically burned body and we cannot get that image out of our minds.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMedical student Mundill Mahil, 20, was jailed last month for six years for GBH with intent. Harvinder Shoker, also 20, got life for murder, while 20-year-old Darren Peters was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Amandip and her mum Tajinder have asked the Attorney General to review the sentence handed to Mahil and set up an e-petition, Justice For Gagandip. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking out for the first time, Amandip added: \"He would not have been murdered if Mundill Mahil hadn't lured him to her flat in Brighton in a carefully orchestrated honeytrap. </p>\n<p>\n\"Mahil will be released for good behaviour in three years. It's outrageous. Other cases involving money and fraud get much more punishment. Gagandip's life has been taken. I believe something more needs to be done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip's body was found in the burning car in Blackheath, south-east London, in February last year. </p>\n<p>\nHe had been violently attacked in Brighton before being driven back to the capital and murdered. </p>\n<p>\n<i>A post-mortem examination revealed he was still alive when the fire in the car was started.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the second tragedy for the family in just 18 months. In September 2009 Gagandip's father Charanjit was murdered in India. Eight people are on trial there accused of being involved. </p>\n<p>\nGagandip took over his dad's packaging firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"We were only just starting to come to terms with the first murder when Gagan was killed. It has knocked the life out of me and Mum.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard that Mahil, from Chatham, Kent, had been Gagandip's girlfriend. He was in love but they split up in August 2010 after she alleged he had sexually assaulted her. </p>\n<p>\nShoker, his friend of five years, also fell in love with Mahil and decided to take revenge on the businessman. </p>\n<p>\nIn February last year she lured Gagandip to her house in Brighton. </p>\n<p>\nShe knew that Shoker and Peters, both from London, would be lying in wait for him. </p>\n<p>\nHe was beaten unconscious and bundled into the boot of the car. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"I only met Mahil once, when Gagandip brought her to our home. She was very pretty and confident and seemed a nice person. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My brother and I were very close and were both living at home and saw each other every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"He became very close to her and said she was a friend he trusted and who he could talk to about anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Look at how she betrayed his trust. She tried to destroy my brother's character in court. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he was a kind, generous man who would have done anything to help anyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDetective Superintendent Damian Allain, who investigated the case, said after the conviction: \"Throughout the investigation and trial Mahil portrayed herself as a victim. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is clear to me, now endorsed by the jury's verdict, that her actions were calculating and that she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy with Shoker and Peters of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which resulted in his death.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family say Gagandip had the world at his feet. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"He ran the family's successful employment agency and packaging business. He also set up and headed Sikh TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"In addition, he was the founder of the British Sikh Student Federation. He had made friends and contacts all around the world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHis mother Tajinder, 45, was equally proud of his achievements. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"He had done so much. I didn't think a 21-year-old would be capable of so much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm amazed how much he achieved. Never a day goes by when we don't think about him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am devastated by my son's killing and struggling to cope. In my life there's only a dead end. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There's nothing left ahead. The whole story has finished here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe now runs the family business, which employs 300 people. But with the emotional turmoil of losing her son she found it almost impossible to carry on with it. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"When I first learned of Gagandip's death I was completely and utterly broken. </p>\n<p>\n\"I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on. I do not have the support of a husband because he also died not so long before Gagan. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I cannot describe on an average day my life since Gagandip's death because they have all blended into one. </p>\n<p>\n\"In the early stages I couldn't hold a conversation without breaking down in tears and there were occasions when the police had to call an ambulance for me after I collapsed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCherished pictures from the family photo album show what a loving son and brother Gagandip was. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a picture of him at his 21st birthday party with killer Shoker. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Shoker turned up uninvited to the party. </p>\n<p>\n\"We knew things weren't right between Gagandip and Shoker by that stage. The photo of them together is so ironic as they look like the best of friends  and for over five years they were. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sickened by the thought that the man who holds his hand lovingly over my brother's heart in the photo is the same person who later beat him so terribly then burned him alive. </p>\n<p>\n\"He spent so much time around at our house that he practically lived here. </p>\n<p>\n\"What he did is such a terrible betrayal of trust.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip was cremated and his ashes scattered in a river at the Kiratpur Sahib temple in the Punjab, India. </p>\n<p>\nLike her mother, Amandip broke down when she remembered the precious times they had together. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I found it hard to go into his bedroom without getting very upset.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, though, they remember him with the shrine in the garden and in his former bedroom in south east London. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Mum and I actually slept in his room as a way of trying to feel closer to him. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now we have turned his bedroom into a shrine, with a large photo of him on the bed and all his clothes and possessions are still in the room.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Gagandip's mum and sister are still clearly in pain over his loss  but their grief would be easier to bear if they felt justice had been done.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional reporting: MARK CHRISTY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3982615/Revenge-killing-of-TV-boss.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'Revenge killing' of TV boss"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3683937/Grieving-mum-in-battle-with-Turkish-cops.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Our son was drugged and murdered for £150 a few hours after this holiday snap... now we want justice"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF24hon5n---532_1476721a.jpg","caption":"Honeytrapper ...

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

Sometimes they literally just faint. But occasionally, they have a cardiac arrest.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs one of a few doctors there when I joined the Lords 17 years ago, I was appalled how poor were the arrangements for these sudden, terrifying emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe attendant staff had often been trained in mouth-to-mouth and cardiac resuscitation, but there was no defibrillator anywhere in Parliament. This piece of kit is a life-saver.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen its electrodes are applied across the chest, its sudden pulse of high voltage electricity can jolt the heart back into a normal rhythmic beat. It's a clever device because its detector only allows an electric shock if the collapsed patient has had a cardiac arrest or a fatal change of heart rhythm.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it is safe and exceptionally easy to use by any layman with minimal training.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet when I tried to persuade the authorities in Parliament to obtain one of these portable machines (they are not expensive) officials in both Houses refused. Their excuses were shameful.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne official argued that we could not have a defibrillator as it would cause a problem if a tourist collapsed in the gallery  should we be obliged to offer resuscitation to a member of the public? It was suggested there might be legal consequences if it were used or not used. Four years later, an elderly peer collapsed right after speaking. There were no doctors present in the chamber and he died.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly then, reluctantly, was a defibrillator installed, and since then at least two lives have been saved. Cardiac arrest is extremely common yet it can be correctable. Clearly, it would help if everybody were trained in external cardiac massage, for example in schools. This knowledge would save some lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a clever defibrillator is a different matter. It is astonishing that so many public buildings do not have them readily available.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Those first few seconds after a cardiac emergency are critical and we must be prepared.\n</i></p>\n<p>\n<b>To sign The Sun-backed British Heart Foundation petition, click here</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4209790/Show-your-support-and-join-our-campaign-for-CPR-in-schools.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4210386/Medics-had-to-zap-Fabrice-Muamba-15-times.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4212641/Fabrice-Muambas-family-give-thanks-to-fans-as-star-recovers.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba's family give thanks to fans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4207991/Fabrice-Muamba-was-dead-for-78-minutes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba was 'dead' for 78 minutes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4205926/Fabrice-Muamba-asks-Did-we-lose.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba asks: Did we lose?"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF2428FX-532_1476788a.jpg","caption":"Race against time ... medics treat Muamba on the pitch and, inset, Lord Robert Winston"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H02NFX_1475388a.jpg"}]},"isArticle":true},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Counting the calories ...

Then there's the back pain. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Lots of women want big boobs but it's actually a total nightmare. </p>\n<p>\n\"The only men I attract are the sleazy type. It's rare that a guy looks me in the face when talking to me. </p>\n<p>\n\"Guys will flat-out stare and try all the cheesy chat-up lines.

She says: \"Women assume my boobs are fake  they look at me like I'm a porn star. It's older women who always comment on them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They'll tut and shake their heads as they walk past me in the street. I can hear them saying, 'They're so fake', and, 'Look at her flaunting them'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I try to smile through it. I know they're real but sometimes it can be hurtful. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've developed a way of walking so my boobs bounce up and down and people can see they're real. It looks like I'm walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\n\"Women can get quite jealous  that's probably why I have more male friends.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut meeting the right guy is difficult. Glasgow girl Stephanie says: \"I broke up with my ex in 2010. He couldn't handle all the attention I get and became insanely jealous. </p>\n<p>\n\"When we were out he'd get mad when other guys checked me out. I tried telling him it couldn't be helped  he knew what he was getting into.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie has seen a few men since the split but no one special has caught her eye. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They become too obsessed with my boobs, it's all they think about. It's hard to find a guy to see past them. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of blokes are just after me for the status of it, they see it as just another notch on the bedpost. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I want my boyfriend to see me for me, I'm more than just a pair of boobs. I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half  but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs  though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that  it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4127333/Model-with-38KKK-boobs-is-saved-by-airbags.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Model with 38KKK boobs is saved by airbags"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4192971/TOWIE-star-Lauren-Pope-I-just-wanted-my-ticking-timebomb-PIP-breast-implants-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I was terrified my PIP implants were a ticking timebomb.

She is now vice-chairman at West Ham. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Karren has two kids with hubby, former player Paul Peschisolido. </b></p>\n<p>\n<b>Here, in extracts from her inspiring new book, Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, Karren, 42, offers some hilarious anecdotes. </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI HAVE a desire for independence, the need for control  or what others call sheer bloody-mindedness. </p>\n<p>\nBut recently I've had to dwell on why I became who I am. I don't reflect on such things easily because I've never been an emotional person. I'm logic personified. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back over my life, I tried to work out how and where the desire for independence began to make itself felt. </p>\n<p>\nAmong my earliest memories was when I was three and my mum Rita and nan Nina left me at home one day with my grandfather, Gerald, while they went shopping. </p>\n<p>\nI remember my mum and dad, Terry, had this elegant drinks cabinet in the lounge. As a toddler I was fascinated by it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe door folded down and all these beautiful little glasses and different-coloured bottles glinted away in the backlight. </p>\n<p>\nI decided to get a chair, climb up and have a good look. Everything looked even better close up. </p>\n<p>\nThe dainty little glasses (for sherry), the perfect size for me, were so tempting that I started to fill them with the green, yellow and clear liquids I saw in the bottles  cr&#232;me de menthe, advocaat and vodka. </p>\n<p>\nTaking little sips and inviting my dolls to do the same, I was having a wonderful time  until my grandfather came into the room and asked what I was doing. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, as soon as he twigged, he told me to stop. Three-year-old me instantly replied: \"This is my house and I'll do as I want.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe left me to it. He was married to my grandmother, so perhaps he knew not to pick a losing fight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Not surprisingly, when my mum and nan got home I was rolling drunk and, by all accounts, not much more co-operative.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather got an earful, I was put to bed and the story passed into family lore. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs my nan used to tell me: \"You were such a little cow  and you know what? You weren't sick, not once. Not a drop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got that streak in you as a toddler, no one's ever going to be able to tell you what to do when you're fully grown. </p>\n<p>\n<i>It wasn't a one-off, either.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA few months later my mum took me to school for the very first time. </p>\n<p>\nPicking me up after my first day, she asked the teacher how I had got on. She had been worried, my mum admitted, because I was very shy. </p>\n<p>\n\"Which one is your daughter?\" the teacher asked. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady,\" said my mother. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady?\" was the incredulous response. \"Shy? She walked in, pulled a boy off his chair and said, 'That's my seat. Move.' I wouldn't be worried if I was you!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was advice my mother took to heart. In fact, that was probably the last time she worried about me. </p>\n<p>\nThere were other powerful influences in my childhood. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of my grandmothers were hard workers, strong women and very important in moulding me. </p>\n<p>\nI was very close to Nina, my mother's mother, in particular, who put an end to that alcoholic tea party when I was three. She was dynamite. She was Italian  from Naples  and incredibly feisty. She would have killed for her family  she wouldn't have thought twice about it. </p>\n<p>\nIf someone cut up my grandfather in traffic, she would get out of the car and punch them on the nose. </p>\n<p>\nI'm sure it won't come as any surprise when I say she was definitely the one in control of her house and marriage. </p>\n<p>\nShe was great with money  not because she had a lot but because she knew the price of everything and she was in charge. </p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather went out to work as a postman but she would take his wages and give him cash to spend. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThat was just the way it was. Grandma Nina really believed in me. Her attitude was: You can do it, so go out there and get on with it. </p>\n<p>\nEven if I get a bit feisty at home now, my husband will still say to me, \"Oh, Nina's here. Nina's coming out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>I was fiercely determined. If I wanted something and my parents wouldn't give it to me, I would find a way to get it for myself.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI was never given pocket money. My parents always offered to buy me what I wanted but I wanted to be in charge of my own money. </p>\n<p>\nI recall them once saying no to something  I can't remember what it was  but I haven't forgotten what I decided to do. I put up signs in my bedroom window  it was my bedroom so I could do what I liked, I reasoned  saying, \"Massages, manicures, come inside!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mother was shouting up: \"Who are all these weirdos coming to the door?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I bawled back: \"They're my customers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI was bloody-minded too. I once put up a Vote Labour poster in my bedroom just because my parents were Conservatives. </p>\n<p>\nMy dad roared: \"Take that down!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"It's my bedroom!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"What does the poster even mean?\" And I didn't know, of course. I just knew it would wind him up and cause a debate. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 14, I'd tell my mum I was going to stay the night with my best friend, Charlotte, who would tell her mum she was staying at my house. </p>\n<p>\nAfter that we would meet up with our clothes in carrier bags, get changed, take the Tube into central London then go out in Soho. </p>\n<p>\nWhen everything closed we'd walk around until the Tube re-started in the early morning and go back to our borough  Enfield in north London. </p>\n<p>\nThen we walked around until 10am before we went home. </p>\n<p>\nMum would say, \"Well, you look very tired.\" But she never knew. Years later, when I told her, she was shocked. But I was even more shocked by what she said to me. </p>\n<p>\nShe looked at my daughter Sophie and said: \"What goes around, comes around.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI went very cold and felt terrible about what I had done. </p>\n<p>\nBut at the time I couldn't have cared less. </p>\n<p>\nNothing was going to happen to me. I was in control, I was safe  or at least I thought I was. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But if I imagine my 15-year-old Sophie going out all night now, well...</i> </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nThe day I made a name for myself </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nMY school had lots of careers days and companies came in and talked to us, including advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the London radio station LBC. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLots of people were interested but whereas everybody thought maybe they'd write to them, I got all the right details before the people left. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe next day I was on the phone making appointments. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoth companies I was interested in offered me a job. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI chose Saatchi, leaving school on the Friday and starting work there the following Monday. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I was only 18, they put me on their graduate programme. I suppose they saw something in me. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I loved it, the programme was very rigid, so finally I got impatient and moved instead to LBC as a 19-year-old selling radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been given Asian Hour to sell, which was pretty tough  a 4am to 5am slot, the real graveyard shift. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been handed a list of companies that spent money on advertising but who didn't advertise on radio. One was Sport Newspapers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI got through to owner David Sullivan on the phone and he wasn't interested, saying \"radio didn't work\". </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI decided I would drop off some material at his office  persistence is everything  and once I was there I decided to wait to meet him in person. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI waited and waited and waited and in the end he agreed to see me because I had waited so long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI did a very quick pitch to him and he wasn't buying it at all, so I said: \"Look, if you take the advertising and sales don't go up, you don't have to pay for it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"That sounds good to me.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI didn't have the authority to do a deal like that, so it was a risk  but I remember thinking, \"Well, if it doesn't work out, what's the worst that can happen? They can fire me but I can always get another job. I'm only 19.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI still use that kind of thinking and I have done all my life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact, it's the foundation of my confidence and my ability to take risks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt worked out. Sales went up and, within months, Sullivan was spending more than &#163;2million a year on radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI was managing it all and earning more commission than all the other sales staff put together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen he offered me a job, which I accepted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat episode is often considered to have been a turning point in my professional life but, in truth, I think my life had been heading that way since I was a young child. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Adapted by BEN JACKSON</b> <b>Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, by Karren Brady, is published by HarperCollins on March 29, &#163;18.99.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4184143/Karren-Bradysbr-football-diary.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4191942/The-Apprentice-unveiled-16-new-wannabes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Apprentice unveiled"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2614813/Karren-Brady-Im-hired.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Karren: I'm hired"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3877834/Apprentice-teens-top-the-adults.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Apprentice teens 'top the adults'"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf23bran1--532_1476008a.jpg","caption":"Driven ...

As far back as 1877 a statue of Venus de Milo was the subject of a court case when a gardener was caught trying to have sex with \"her\". </p>\n<p>\nMore recently, American Edward Smith has expressed his love for his VW Beetle, Vanilla, though he admits having \"relationships\" with many vehicles. </p>\n<p>\nHis most intense sexual experience was \"making love\" to a helicopter from the Eighties TV series Airwolf  but his major love is cars. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEdward said: \"I go a little bit beyond appreciating the beauty of a car, to the point of what I feel is an expression of love. </p>\n<p>\n\"I write poetry about cars, I sing to them and talk to them like a girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not sick. Cars are just my preference.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe told earlier this month how Leeds shop assistant Amanda Whittaker, 27, has fallen for the Statue of Liberty, or \"Libby\" as she knows her. At school she loved a drum kit. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1979, Eija-Riitta Ekl&#246;f from Sweden \"married\" the Berlin Wall. Eija, who changed her surname to Berliner-Mauer, coined the term Objectum Sexual (OS) for her unconventional orientation. </p>\n<p>\nMrs Berliner-Mauer says her \"long-distance\" relationship survived the \"tragedy\" of the wall being pulled down in 1989  but she has fallen for a red fence. Former US soldier Erika LaBrie, 41, pledged to love, honour and obey the Eiffel Tower in an intimate ceremony in Paris in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nErika Eiffel founded the Objectum Sexuality Internationale group which has more than 40 members and a website. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOther \"inanimate lovers\" revealed by objectophiles include a cartoon character, steam locomotives, words, public buildings and a hydraulic flood barrier. </p>\n<p>\nSan Francisco sexologist Dr Amy Marsh carried out a scientific survey involving 21 objectophiles and found cars, trains and aircraft are the most common objects of desire. </p>\n<p>\nBut more women than men are objectophiles and they are more likely to love structures. </p>\n<p>\nDr Marsh said: \"OS transcends fetishism and is experienced as a sexual and/ or affectionate orientation with an array of emotions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It does not seem to be caused by trauma or delusional psychiatric conditions, though it does seem linked with autism. </p>\n<p>\n\"Professionals need to learn more about OS and treat OS patients with the same respect they do for other sexual preference minorities.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information go to dramymarshsexologist.com</a>. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nm.phillips@the-sun.co.uk </a> </a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210058/Im-in-love-with-3ft-statue-of-Adonis.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I'm in love with 3ft statue of Adonis"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2322gn-5323_1476064a.jpg","caption":"Flight of fancy ...

I blamed the bad smells on the dog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nConstantly banning herself from the food she loves has made Alison's adult life a misery. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My hatred of being big has meant I have spent every day on a dieting roller coaster. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a fad diet junkie. It has become an addiction.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Alison's first diet memory goes back to when she was just 13. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll never forget the anxiety I felt when a shop girl told my mum there wasn't a school dress big enough for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I squeezed into the size they had and trundled off to secondary school tugging at the hemline in embarrassment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter being called \"fatty\" in that first year at school, Alison embarked on her first diet. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum had the Scarsdale Diet book and for six weeks I had grapefruit for breakfast, protein and salad for lunch and protein and veg for tea. </p>\n<p>\n\"Although I was always starving and grumpy, I stuck to it and lost a stone over the summer holidays and hit my goal weight of 8st. </p>\n<p>\n\"Even though I wasn't as skinny as some of my friends, I was just so happy to have been accepted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as soon as Alison stopped the diet plan, she shot back up to 9st, large for her 5ft 6in frame. </p>\n<p>\nSo she was actually <b>HAPPY</b> when she contracted glandular fever at the age of 16. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost a stone effortlessly  I was thrilled. I battled to stay that size but the weight I'd lost on the 'Glandular Fever Diet' didn't stay off. </p>\n<p>\n\"As soon as the biscuit barrel was in sight, I piled on the weight.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison's obsession got worse when she found even quicker fixes. Within six months of turning 19, she had tried the Fit For Life Diet, the Egg And Grapefruit Diet and the Banana Diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I even tried the Lunch Box Diet. The idea is that you fill a lunch box up with lots of healthy food. That was great... until I started replacing the salad with chocolate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring her twenties, Alison's weight fluctuated between a healthy 9½st and 10st  but she longed to be a stone lighter again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA turning point in her dieting nightmare came when she married Frank, a photographer, now 48, in 1988 when she was 22. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost half a stone through a combination of nerves and WeightWatchers but, again, it didn't stay off. Within a year, I'd gone to almost 11st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison got desperate and started the meal replacement Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Within two months I was down to 8½st but, boy, it was hard. It was worth it though. I was slim and loving it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYo-yo dieting her way through the Eighties, Alison would spend hours researching gimmicks to keep herself below 10st  until she became pregnant for the first time in 1991. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I embraced eating for two and indulged in whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I looked massive. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was more than 14st when I gave birth to Charlie, who is now 20.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Afterwards, Alison got straight back into her fad diet cycle and spent a fortune on books and consultations to get back down to her beloved 9st. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she explains: \"Just as I hit the 10st mark, I found out I was pregnant with baby No2. </p>\n<p>\n\"Again, I ate for Britain. This time I was 13½st when I gave birth to Olivia in 1995.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce more, Alison threw herself into a host of different diets. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"You name it, I tried it. I'd feel motivated at the beginning and lose a few pounds but then I'd have a blip and pig out for a few days before embarking on another 'new' diet, telling myself this would be 'the one'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison did not manage to slim down before becoming pregnant again in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nThe cycle of gorging and dieting continued after daughter Florence was born in 2001, and Alison flitted between 11 and 12½st. </p>\n<p>\nTwo years ago, Alison's husband told her he was worried because her stomach was bigger than her bust. </p>\n<p>\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan had worked for her in the past and, amazingly, she lost three-and-a-half stone in just three months. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"At last I was 10st again. I stayed at that weight for six months by cutting out carbs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I looked great but missed bread and pasta.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut gradually the carbs slipped back on to her plate and Alison now admits: \"I'm back to 12st... oh all right, 12½st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hate being this big but I can't face another liquid replacement diet  unless the liquid is Sauvignon Blanc. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Most of all, I'm sick of knowing that if I could just eat less and exercise more, my weight would naturally decrease. Perhaps then I would finally be happy.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nALISON'S DIETS </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n1. The Scarsdale </p>\n<p>\n2.

Sian, 20, who lives with her parents in Welwyn, Kent, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdam was such a fit young man that even now it's hard to accept he died so suddenly. </p>\n<p>\nWe were enjoying a family holiday in Cyprus. Just minutes before he died, Adam had been laughing and playing water volleyball. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then he said he felt unwell. He got out and sat on the side of the pool  before suddenly collapsing head first into the water. </p>\n<p>\nMy parents and I had gone for a walk and a friend of Adam's dashed to find us. By the time we got back, Adam had been pulled out of the pool. </p>\n<p>\nAn ambulance was on its way and a nurse was desperately giving him the kiss of life, trying to restart his heart. </p>\n<p>\nNow we know Adam had had a cardiac arrest. Tragically, it was too late to save him. </p>\n<p>\nTwo post-mortems  one in Cyprus and one in the UK  confirmed he died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nFor years we believed it was something peculiar to Adam. Then two years ago Cry, The Sudden Death Charity, suggested the family should all be screened. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum Julie, 50, had heart checks first  and, astoundingly, was diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nCommonly associated with Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, it is an inherited condition that affects the heart's rhythm. A year later I too was diagnosed with it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a shock to realise this syndrome was undoubtedly responsible for Adam's death in 2004 and the deaths of many other young people. </p>\n<p>\nWe then discovered it can be picked up by a simple ECG. Had Adam been tested his death could have been prevented. </p>\n<p>\nIn July 2010 I had a mini defibrillator fitted. </p>\n<p>\nIt is terrible to think Adam's death has probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\nThat's why I believe everyone should undergo a routine heart trace at 14. If an irregular heartbeat is detected, doctors can investigate further. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nNick Dias </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ASSISTANT site manager Nick collapsed in December and has now been fitted with a pacemaker. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The 27-year-old lives with fianc&#233;e Lynsey, 25, and their children, Brooke, five, and Riley, seven months, in Radlett, Herts. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a non-smoker, who is slim and exercises regularly, I never imagined I would have a heart problem. </p>\n<p>\nBut in December last year Lynsey and I were walking Brooke to school and after bending down to get her schoolbag from Riley's pushchair I passed out. </p>\n<p>\nSeconds later I came round to find Lynsey looking very concerned. Apparently I'd fallen backwards and cracked my head on the pavement. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe assumed I'd fainted and carried on walking Brooke to school. But as we did so, Lynsey became more worried because I started talking gibberish  I kept repeating myself and asking strange questions. </p>\n<p>\nAfter dropping Brooke off, Lynsey insisted on driving me to A&amp;E at Watford General Hospital. She was worried I might have concussion. </p>\n<p>\nThe doctor said because I'd passed out, he wanted to check my heart. And I was horrified when the ECG detected a problem with the rhythm of my heart. </p>\n<p>\nTerrifyingly, the doctor said I was suffering from heart block where the electrical impulses that make the heart beat don't always reach the heart. </p>\n<p>\nI was lucky my heart had started beating again  but next time I might not be so lucky and if I wasn't treated, could have a full-blown cardiac arrest. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors have been unable to find a reason for my heart block. As they have also found a slight problem with a heart valve, it is possibly something I was born with. </p>\n<p>\nSince then I've had a pacemaker fitted. </p>\n<p>\nDoctors say when the children are ten they will have to be tested too. </p>\n<p>\nBut it's something I feel should be routinely tested for in everyone. If it weren't for Lynsey insisting I go to A&amp;E that day, I might not have discovered this. </p>\n<p>\nAnd ultimately I could have suddenly suffered a potentially fatal cardiac arrest at any time. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4207991/Fabrice-Muamba-was-dead-for-78-minutes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba was 'dead' for 78 minutes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4205926/Fabrice-Muamba-asks-Did-we-lose.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba asks: Did we lose?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4203089/Muamba-troll-arrested.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Muamba troll arrested"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4202642/Prem-star-Fabrice-is-still-critical.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Prem star Fabrice is still critical"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4201632/Jermain-Defoe-sends-message-of-support-to-striken-Fabrice-Muamba.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Pray for Fab"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4201593/Tottenham-v-Bolton-FA-Cup-tie-abandoned-after-Fabrice-Muamba-collapses.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Muamba collapses on pitch"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H2G-_1475241a.jpg","caption":"Cardiac arrest ...

Aspirin works by suppressing the creation of prostaglandin, a hormone that carries information about pain to the brain. It was first sold as 1899 as a powder by the German firm Bayer. </p>\n<p>\nAspirin can clearly do more than banish headaches, though some experts believe it could do more harm than good. </p>\n<p>\nHere, we look at some of the surprising uses. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDepression </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSOME experts believe depression and inflammation could be linked after small studies found some depressed people have high levels of cytokines  naturally occurring chemicals with inflammatory properties  in the body. </p>\n<p>\nSo because it's an anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin might be able to help. </p>\n<p>\nOne study followed 386 women for ten years  22 developed depression after the age of 50. </p>\n<p>\nOf these only one had taken aspirin. </p>\n<p>\nBut among those who did not develop depression, almost a third were taking it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAcne </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA KEY ingredient in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is used in many of today's off-the-shelf acne products. </p>\n<p>\nMix a tablet with water then rub the solution on to your skin. </p>\n<p>\nLeave it on for two minutes, then rinse off. </p>\n<p>\nThis will dry your pimples out and your spots will go faster. </p>\n<p>\nIf you have normal or dry skin don't try this more than once a week as you will lose too much moisture from your skin. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nDandruff </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA COMMON cause of this is a tiny yeast called Pityroporum ovale, which lives on the scalp. Aspirin is a mild anti-fungal so it can help. </p>\n<p>\nCrush two tablets and mix them with one serving of shampoo. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture to your hair and leave for about two minutes so it can settle on your scalp. </p>\n<p>\nRinse it off and shampoo your hair again. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDementia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSTUDIES have found that Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is an inflammatory condition of the brain so aspirin might be effective in treating it. </p>\n<p>\nResearch carried out in Utah, involving the observation and testing of more than 3,000 people, suggested taking it could reduce the risk of contracting the condition by 23 per cent. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nHeart disease </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIT IS thought it can help by reducing inflammation in the arteries that supply the heart  making the blood less likely to become sticky and form a deadly clot. </p>\n<p>\nIn some studies, taking aspirin reduced the likelihood of a cardiovascular problem, including heart disease, heart attack or stroke, by as much as 44 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nExperts also found it can help someone who has already had a heart attack or a stroke by reducing the risk of having another by a third. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAthlete's Foot </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nATHLETE'S foot and other fungal infections can be treated using a few aspirin pills and talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nGrind three pills until they are in a powder form. </p>\n<p>\nThen mix the powdered aspirin with some talcum powder. </p>\n<p>\nApply the mixture on to the infected area of skin. </p>\n<p>\nDo this process twice a day to kill the fungi and to treat the irritation. </p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>\nIn-growing hair </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHAVE you got a painful in-growing hair that won't budge? </p>\n<p>\nAspirin is made up of acetylsalicylic acid, which exfoliates skin and has anti-inflammatory properties. </p>\n<p>\nSo applying a thick paste made of crushed aspirin and a little warm water could help you remove it with ease. </p>\n<p>\nApply it to the hair and leave to settle for ten to 15 minutes. Then remove using warm water. </p>\n<p>\nThis should get rid of the hair, or at least make it easier to remove. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nPre-eclampsia </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA DAILY dose of aspirin during pregnancy could cut the risk of pre-eclampsia, a condition that threatens the lives of both mother and baby. </p>\n<p>\nA study of 32,000 women published in The Lancet medical journal found that mums who took it were ten per cent less likely to develop the condition. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nInsect bites </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAS these are marked by redness, itchiness and sometimes a burning sensation, aspirin  an anti-inflammatory  can help clear these up. </p>\n<p>\nWet the affected area and rub a small aspirin over the skin to help relieve the pain caused by mosquito bites or stings from a bee, wasp or hornet. </p>\n<p>\nTaking it orally could also help to reduce any painful swelling. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nShingles </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nASPIRIN is thought to be one of the most effective treatments for dealing with the pain and uncomfortable symptoms associated with shingles. </p>\n<p>\nMash two tablets into a paste and use a clean cotton swab to apply it to the skin. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nThe risks... </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<li></li> ONE in five asthmatics are at risk of a severe reaction to aspirin, according to research in Australia and the UK. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A recent London University study linked taking aspirin with a 30 per cent rise in the risk of debilitating  and potentially fatal  internal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> A study last January advised doctors to stop prescribing aspirin to ward off heart attacks as it raises the risk of bleeding in the stomach by a third. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Oxford researchers say a daily dose as small as 75mg could increase the risk of abdominal bleeding. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Anyone with an allergy to aspirin or a bleeding or clotting disorder should not use it for any purpose. </p>\n<p>\n<b>If in doubt, consult your GP.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/beauty/4187699/How-to-eat-and-exercise-your-way-to-higher-IQ.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Go brain training"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4167528/Working-without-machines.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Working without machines"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4156455/Denise-Van-Outen-Cycling-makes-me-feel-like-a-kid-again.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Denise Van Outen: Cycling makes me feel like a kid again"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22ASP---_1475246a.jpg","caption":"Painless ... aspirin has been hailed as a treatment for depression, dementia and even cancer"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22ASP2_1475245a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22ASPX-_1475244a.jpg"}]},"isArticle":true},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"'Cameron fills my life with love and joy' ...

Now she believes she is Britain's luckiest mum","byline":"By KATE THOMPSON and JENNY FRANCIS","timestamp":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000","articlebody":"<p>\nCRYSTAL Pawson cradled her newborn son and feared, at 16, she was too young to be the mum he needed. </p>\n<p>\nLess than 20 minutes later her worries were magnified when doctors revealed her baby had Down's syndrome. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a bombshell blow  but 11 years on Crystal believes she is Britain's luckiest mum. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Cameron is loyal, funny and affectionate and fills my life with love and joy. </p>\n<p>\n\"You couldn't hope to meet a more smashing lad. Having Cameron has been the making of me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lad is also a brilliant big brother to Luke, ten, Jake, four, Mackenzie, two, and four-month-old Brooklyn. </p>\n<p>\nAs the Down's Syndrome Association runs its awareness campaign this week, courageous Crystal, 27, revealed how Cameron has made her a better person. </p>\n<p>\nAround one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down's and there are 60,000 people in the UK with the condition. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough the chance of a baby having Down's is higher for older mothers, more babies with Down's are born to younger women  because they have more children. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal fell pregnant at 15 and as the likelihood of having a Down's baby was considered so rare for a mum-to-be of her age, doctors had not even asked if she wanted to be tested. </p>\n<p>\nLike many women, Crystal assumed only older mums had Down's children. She admits when she was first told of her son's diagnosis at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire, she was horrified and ashamed. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was still getting my head round the fact he had Down's when three hours after his birth he was whisked off for a scan. </p>\n<p>\n\"When they brought my baby back and told me he had three holes in his heart and would need a major op to fix it, I just fell apart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe devastated teenager sobbed in her mother's arms. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home in Wetherby, West Yorks, sharing a room with her sister and her new tot made life even harder. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I couldn't bear to go out, not because I didn't want to show him off but I was so scared he would die. </p>\n<p>\n\"He seemed so vulnerable and I was way out of my depth. I sobbed myself to sleep every night and kept thinking 'why me?'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCameron's dad, 16-year-old Drew, stood by her  visiting the pair regularly. But Crystal was convinced he would leave her. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"All his mates were out clubbing and he was a 16-year-old lad with a baby with Down's.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAt three months old Cameron went in for the op to fix the holes in his heart. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal was warned he would be in hospital for up to three months but after just three weeks he was doing so well he was discharged. </p>\n<p>\nBack at home, while most girls her age were out having fun, 16-year-old Crystal was caring for a very sick baby. Then something amazing happened. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Cameron just fought and fought and suddenly I realised it was time to stop feeling sorry for myself. I gave myself a massive boot up the backside. </p>\n<p>\n\"OK, my son wasn't the perfect baby but he was my son and he deserved a mum who would fight for him all the way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDrew and Crystal moved in together and the teen parents learnt Makaton, a language programme using signs and symbols, so they could communicate with Cameron as he grew up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"Being able to sign was a major bonus. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Cameron and I formed a remarkable bond and suddenly I realised his disability was anything but.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Crystal fell pregnant with another child when Cameron was just 18 months old, a few friends said she wouldn't be able to cope. </p>\n<p>\nShe was offered a nuchal scan to determine the likelihood of Down's, but turned it down. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I didn't want to know. I coped with Cameron and I knew I'd cope again.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBaby Luke was born healthy, as was Jake two years after. </p>\n<p>\nCrystal said: \"The specialists don't know why I had a baby with Down's so young and then it never occurred again. They say it's extremely rare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Cameron was seven, Crystal split from his dad, suddenly finding herself a single mum to three boys. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I'm not saying it was easy but dealing with Cameron gave me the strength to deal with anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Some people close to me thought I would have a breakdown but it was actually Cameron that kept me going. </p>\n<p>\n\"He developed this really cheeky, funny personality. He had me in stitches and when I was down he seemed to sense it and would give me a cuddle. He's just so happy I couldn't be sad around him.\" </p>\n<p>\nCrystal has since found love with 21-year-old shop worker Darren Hooper. The couple have two sons. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Life's good. Cameron goes to a special needs school which he loves and has really boosted his speech and learning. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll admit that when I first heard my little boy had Down's I reached the depths of despair but now I don't see him as a boy with problems. </p>\n<p>\n\"I see him for what he is  an unbelievably loving little boy who loves cuddles and has tons of affection and love to give. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I know people thought I didn't have the maturity to cope but having Cameron has been the making of me.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Crystal has high hopes for Cameron's future: \"I would love him to move out of home, get a job, marry and go on to have his own family one day and there's no reason why he can't achieve any of those dreams. </p>\n<p>\n\"Cameron has ambitions like any boys his age. He loves playing sports and listening to Lady GaGa. </p>\n<p>\n\"He tells me he wants to be a footballer one day and I tell him he should aim high and go for it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Every child, no matter if they have Down's syndrome, should be given a chance to prove what they can do and lead as ordinary a life as possible.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSarah offers other parents hope </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nDOWN'S syndrome actress Sarah Gordy is proof that people with disabilities can lead a full and rewarding life. </p>\n<p>\nThe 34-year-old  who plays Lady Pamela on BBC drama Upstairs Downstairs  has starred in many TV shows and plays. And her mum Jane, 63, could not be more proud of her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jane, speaking about discovering her first-born had Down's syndrome, admitted: \"Being completely honest, if I was given a test and told my baby had Down's I would have considered a termination. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'd have been terrified about not being able to look after her. But that saddens me now. </p>\n<p>\n\"When I fell pregnant I wasn't ready to be a mum. In my 20s at the time, I'd never changed a nappy so I felt very unprepared. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Sarah was born I couldn't believe how beautiful she was.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane didn't have any tests for Down's syndrome because she was under 28 when she fell pregnant. But the paediatrician noticed Sarah had the condition from the moment he saw her. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"Calling my husband Jerry aside, he told him that Sarah had the condition. Not only that, but he asked him not to tell me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He said it was important for me to form a bond with Sarah first. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking back I don't know how poor Jerry kept it to himself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt wasn't until four days later that Jane found out. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I was heartbroken and terrified I would lose my baby. He kept telling me about potential heart problems and operations she'd need. </p>\n<p>\n\"But finding out turned me from a girl into a fully-fledged mother.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily, Sarah didn't need any operations. Jane said: \"I wish I knew back then what I know now, about how much of an amazing life she'd have.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJane had another daughter, Catherine, now 32, 16 months after Sarah and admits she felt relief when tests showed she did not have Down's. </p>\n<p>\nJane said: \"I just didn't know if having two children with the condition would be too much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wish parents-to-be were provided with more information about Down's syndrome before they make a decision about termination. </p>\n<p>\n\"No one should ever feel pressured either way, but it's such a difficult decision to make without knowing exactly what it will entail.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile everything took longer with Sarah, Jane says she soon realised her daughter had an incredible ability to feel what other people feel. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"If I'm ever stressed or worried and I tell Sarah I'm fine she will say, 'No you're not,' and I have to come clean. We're very close as no emotion goes unnoticed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Jane explains that Down's syndrome actors work very differently to those without the condition. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The interesting thing about Sarah is she doesn't really act. She feels very emotional on set. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't fake emotion, so instead she believes everything about her character. </p>\n<p>\n\"Once she was acting as an abused wife and I saw how much the abusive words were hurting her. </p>\n<p>\n\"When she came off set I said, 'Sarah  you're a beautiful, successful actress' and she slowly remembered that. </p>\n<p>\n\"I like to think that Sarah being successful on TV gives parents who are expecting a Down's syndrome child strength and confidence that their child can lead a really healthy life.\"\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL BOYS, Chief Executive at Down's Syndrome Association</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWE have seen great improvements in the lives of people with Down's syndrome since the association's formation in 1970. </p>\n<p>\nToday, the average life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome is 60 to 65 years, compared to 35 to 40 back in 1970.

Sick of her unhealthy lifestyle and size 18 waist, Linda decided to ditch booze for good. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I was stuck in a destructive routine of drinking and eating too much. </p>\n<p>\nI'd just broken up with my boyfriend and wanted to move on. I'd read about the LighterLife diet and wanted to give it a go. </p>\n<p>\nOvernight I gave up alcohol and started eating four food packs a day, containing 5-600 calories. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a complete shock to the system and the first week was really hard, but I knew it would be worth it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI used to drink a bottle of wine most nights, on Fridays I'd have work drinks and Saturdays I'd be out drinking with non-work friends. </p>\n<p>\nSundays were spent recovering. It was relentless. Drinking with clients and colleagues was part of my life and I'd got myself into really bad habits. </p>\n<p>\nIt was only after I gave it up I noticed what a big impact it had. </p>\n<p>\nNow after a work night out I'll come into the office whistling and full of energy, while my colleagues are often a step behind me. And I remember all the office gossip! </p>\n<p>\nIt's been five months now and I feel stronger, more confident and I have more energy than ever before. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from 14st 9lb to 12st, from a size 18-16 to a size 14-12  and I know I look as good as I feel. </p>\n<h1>\nLaura Coventry, 33 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDDING photographer Laura, from Glasgow, went teetotal two years ago after bingeing on boozy nights out left her with huge memory blanks. She says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most girls in their twenties and thirties I lived for the weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThe prospect of partying and heavy drinking got me through the working week and I'd wish away Monday to Friday. </p>\n<p>\nI drank a lot, not just a couple of glasses of wine, but enough to get seriously drunk. I just loved the euphoria and the buzz that it gave me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd suffer terrible hangovers, I'd regularly be in bed until 5pm with headaches and feeling sick, but I saw it as a price worth paying to let my inhibitions go. </p>\n<p>\nOn occasions I'd been out with friends, woken up with a shocking hangover  and realised there were huge blanks in my night out I couldn't remember. </p>\n<p>\nIt really scared me and for the first time I questioned why I was doing this to myself. I knew I had to change. </p>\n<p>\nThe first two weeks were the hardest, but I managed the first three-month goal I set myself, then extended that to six months. </p>\n<p>\nNow not one drop of booze has passed my lips since February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nSome friends want me to start going out drinking with them again and say that I've proven my point, but I'm determined not to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI have a fantastic new boyfriend now and I wake up on Mondays smiling, something which never happened before. </p>\n<p>\nI still party but I don't need alcohol to get a buzz. Life feels so much fuller and better. </p>\n<h1>\nLucy Troughton, 31 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>IT was last October when Lucy went teetotal after realising the damaging effect alcohol was having on her mood. The waitress, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI lived in London between the ages of 19 to 22 and I was out drinking socially most nights. But when I fell pregnant at 23 I didn't drink for the best part of a year. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not that I missed it but I still felt very young to be stuck at home, not out partying like I used to. </p>\n<p>\nI was in a band so drinking was almost expected of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of my friends didn't have kids so there was always someone around to go out drinking with. I soon reverted back to weekend drinking. </p>\n<p>\nI got stuck in a rut of Mondays being a write-off, like I was waiting for the day to finish the moment I woke up. </p>\n<p>\nI wanted to be on form for my daughter Grace, now seven, but I was tired and only realised when it was too late that I was becoming depressed. </p>\n<p>\nIn mid-October last year I decided enough was enough and gave up alcohol completely. </p>\n<p>\nIt was, and still is, very hard. I didn't go out and became a bit of a recluse, focusing more on my music, gardening and reading. </p>\n<p>\nIt's had a huge effect and I really love the mornings now. </p>\n<p>\nI feel so clear-headed. And people often comment on how I'm 'glowing' now. </p>\n<p>\nThe idea of a glass of wine with a meal is still a temptation but it does get easier to say \"No\". </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal has taught me what I really value. And I'm happier than ever. </p>\n<h1>\nKatie Carr, 22 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BARMAID Katie from Bridlington, East Yorks, was a beer-swilling, pizza-scoffing ladette. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She went teetotal in July 2010 after binge drinking caused her to have a seizure and a new love interest persuaded her to transform her life. Katie says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTequila, sambuca, J&#228;gerbombs  I wasn't fussy. I could get through 20 pints of lager in a night. </p>\n<p>\nIn June 2010, I'd been fired from my job as a waitress for consistently turning up to work reeking of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree weeks later, I'd spent &#163;1,200 in my local pub. I put on nine stone in a year on a diet of booze and pizza, weighed 18.5st and was a size 22. I didn't wear make-up or dress girly. </p>\n<p>\nOne night in July, I was out with friends when I had a seizure in a nightclub. </p>\n<p>\nI was carried out by a bouncer and taken to hospital by ambulance. The doctor instructed me to stop drinking for six weeks while they ran tests. </p>\n<p>\nWhile I was sober, I had time to re-evaluate who I was. </p>\n<p>\nWanting to seize the day, I contacted the bouncer and asked him, \"When are you going to take me out?\". I was amazed when he said later that week. </p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the CT scans came back clear  I'd just drunk too much. I've not been back on the booze since and have now lost eight stone. </p>\n<p>\nGoing teetotal is one of the best things I've ever done. </p>\n<p>\nI've gone from ladette to lady. </p>\n<h1>\nRebecca Spencer, 35 </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THE charity worker from Southend, Essex, went teetotal seven years ago after a charity trip shocked her into a lifestyle change.

It was just something we did and I didn't see it as a problem. </p>\n<p>\nIn 2005 I embarked on a charity trip with Help The Aged to India to photograph how people were rebuilding their lives after the 2004 tsunami. </p>\n<p>\nIt was the most eye-opening, inspiring and horrendous experience, all at the same time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe destruction was overpowering and having an alcoholic drink in that context seemed completely ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nThe experience changed my values and made me completely reassess myself. </p>\n<p>\nJust a few days after being in India I was in Covent Garden surrounded by young professionals knocking back drinks without a thought. </p>\n<p>\nI'd seen people with absolutely nothing and I decided to re-focus my life on the things that counted. Alcohol seemed such a self-destructive extravagance. </p>\n<p>\nAs soon as I gave up I realised I'd never even really liked the taste of alcohol  it was just the social side of it I enjoyed. </p>\n<p>\nNine months after the charity trip I fell pregnant and later had my son. </p>\n<p>\nI felt great and no part of me wanted to drink again. </p>\n<p>\nI've been teetotal for seven years now and feel healthier, more energetic and have much more in my pocket  why go back? </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210389/Drink-kills-25-more-in-8-years.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Drink kills 25% more in 8 years"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4203848/Sunder-the-influence.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Sunder the influence..."}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01474/SNF20BOOZE--_1474058a.jpg","caption":"On the wagon ...

Forget heavy tans, thick layers of foundation and cakey bronzer  radiance is now the key word in the beauty world. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Catwalk models have all been given little else but radiant, glowing skin, while celebrities such as Natalie Portman are setting the precedent for softer, fresher looks. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>If YOU fancy brightening your complexion, a few simple tricks can lift your skin. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>LAUREN NAYLOR shares her skin secrets so you can get up and glow. </b>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSkin perfection </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nLET'S face it, we'd all love to feel confident make-up free and be blessed with a radiant, glowy complexion. </p>\n<p>\nBut daily exposure to harsh elements can make it difficult to pull off. Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

Look for natural ingredients that gently slough off dead skin. </p>\n<p>\nWalnut shell, papaya and pineapple are all fantastic natural exfoliators. Try <b>Origins Never A Dull Moment</b> skin-brightening polisher with fruit extracts to help reveal a healthy glow, &#163;24 <i>(Origins)</i>. </p>\n<p>\nPut your feet up and slather on <b>Elemis Papaya Enzyme Peel</b>, &#163;28.60 <i>(Elemis counters)</i>.

You can layer under make-up or wear stand-alone. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are going out and want to appear more made up, try adding highlighter along the cheekbones, down the bridge of the nose and on the forehead  this gives a shimmering dewiness. </p>\n<p>\nYou can also place highlighter on the brow bone and under the arch of the brow to make your eyes appear brighter. </p>\n<p>\n<b>L'Oreal Lumi Magique Concealer</b>, &#163;8.49, <i>(Boots)</i> will help to brighten the eyes if you dab a small amount in the darkest areas, ie, underneath, and <b>Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer</b> in Chestnut, &#163;17, is great for darker skins.

He likened it to when The X Factor winner Joe McElderry was robbed of the Christmas number one spot after an internet campaign to make Rage Against The Machine win. </p>\n<p>\nSimon said: \"If someone beats or competes, it means you've got to work better. And in a funny way the viewers benefit.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>He added: \"I thought I'd make a difference because I was in the mood to do it.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAmanda Holden is the only judge who has done all six series and Simon insists her position was never in doubt. </p>\n<p>\nThe line-up is now Simon, Amanda, Alesha Dixon and comedian David Walliams. </p>\n<p>\nSimon said: \"I couldn't do it without my Amanda. Alesha I've been after her for a long time and David I've wanted on the show for two years.\" </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC has lavished &#163;22million on The Voice and Simon blasted them for refusing to admit they are in competition with his shows. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They wanted to have a pop at BGT because it's too popular and they don't like The X Factor being as popular as it is.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he backed X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos to return  despite her sex tape shame. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I'm a hundred million per cent behind her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the latest series begins it has emerged BGT sensation Jonathan Antoine, 17, was so badly bullied about his weight that he suffered a nervous breakdown in October. </p>\n<p>\nWhen the 20-stone teenager came on stage with friend Charlotte Jaconelli, 16, Simon could be heard whispering to guest judge Carmen Electra: \"Just when you thought it can't get any worse.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as the pair performed Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's The Prayer, Jonathan's incredible opera voice won a standing ovation. </p>\n<p>\nOn last night's show Simon asked Jonathan if he would consider ditching pal Charlotte  but Jonathan valiantly refused. </p>\n<p>\nA spokesperson for mental health charity Mind welcomed the news BGT was supporting Jonathan  who is being monitored by a psychiatrist. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile Sam Kelly, 19, of Norfolk, wowed the BGT panel playing guitar and singing Adele's version of Make You Feel My Love. Simon told him: \"I've got to tell you Sam, when you've got absolute silence in a room like this, you've nailed it.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nj.blackburn@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\"></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By JEN BLACKBURN, TV Reporter </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"IT'S all about The Voice,\" boomed Sir Tom Jones as the BBC's glossy new &#163;22million show set out to prove that it doesn't matter what you look like, as long as you can sing. </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC's X Factor alternative was brilliant, even if the judges spent more time boasting than judging. </p>\n<p>\nBut for my money it was a warm-up act for Britain's Got Talent, which has been revitalised by the addition of Alesha Dixon and a very cheeky David Walliams. </p>\n<p>\nBeeb bosses seriously underestimated the cunning Simon Cowell, never short of a spanner to throw into the works. </p>\n<p>\nBGT proved it still had plenty to offer as it closed with 20-stone teen Jonathan Antoine shuffling on  and showcasing his incredible talent. </p>\n<p>\nBut the biggest winners are the viewers, who now have months of brilliant Saturday night telly. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nAlesha's all smiles </h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nALESHA Dixon says she is having more fun on Britain's Got Talent than she did on Strictly. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nAfter three years as a judge on the BBC dance show, Alesha made the move to ITV after a big-money offer from Simon Cowell  and is sure it was a good call. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe 33-year-old said: \"It's been brilliant.

Tulisa doesn't respect herself because of the way she was brought up  especially when it comes to men.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explained sadly: \"A young girl who respects herself would choose her partner very wisely. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is clearly not making the right partner choices. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is not seeking out a healthy relationship  a genuine and honourable man.\" </p>\n<p>\nMel grew close to Tulisa after her real mum Ann had a breakdown when she was just 11. </p>\n<p>\nShe fears her stepdaughter, 23, will struggle to live down the tape showing her performing a sex act on then-boyfriend Justin Edwards, 28  a wannabe rap star who calls himself MC Ultra. </p>\n<p>\nMel went on to blast whoever left Tulisa squirming by posting the footage on the internet. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I know chances are Tulisa is the victim. But she needs to stop being so careless with herself and her career. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is so talented and has the chance to make it big. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't afford for stuff to come out like this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe stepmum blamed Tulisa's broken home and her subsequent hunt for a father figure for landing herself in trouble. She said: </p>\n<p>\n\"She needs strong loving parental guidance. Unfortunately for Tulisa, her mum is not very well and she has got a father who is a distant character. </p>\n<p>\n\"I feel she is a victim of her childhood,  the classic little girl who wants her father's love. </p>\n<p>\n\"And that is because she's been desperately seeking the love and affection of men since she was a little girl. </p>\n<p>\n\"From what I can see  as someone who knows her from childhood  she is searching for someone just like her father. </p>\n<p>\n\"She needs to find someone kind, honourable and genuine. A man who comes from a proper family background and has family values.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel  now a housewife living in Hertfordshire  described the singer's relationship with her father Plato as stormy. She claimed this did not make for a happy childhood, saying: \"All Tulisa wanted was her father's love.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel wed Plato in 1999 two years after they met. The couple had moved in together in Queen's Park, North West London. </p>\n<p>\nDescribing how Tulisa was sometimes a handful, Mel said: </p>\n<p>\n\"When she was young, her role models were Charlie's Angels and the Spice Girls. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were all about empowering yourself and girl power. I said to her: 'True girl power is a strong independent woman who really likes and knows who she is.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The fans may see this very hardened, tough character who has all the tattoos  but the character that I see is the little girl that I remember.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel believes the pressure of being in a band from a young age made Tulisa grow up too quickly. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"She was sexualised from a very young age. </p>\n<p>\n\"I used to gasp at some of the things she wore as a girl. </p>\n<p>\n\"She had no one to tell her it was inappropriate to wear stomach and cleavage-baring tops when she was just developing. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always went for wild guys  the type her father hated.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTulisa took to YouTube last Wednesday to admit she was the star of the embarrassingly intimate video with ex-boyfriend Justin. </p>\n<p>\nShe had earlier denied she was the blonde performing a sex act on him in the six-minute clip. </p>\n<p>\nMel said of whoever released the tape: \"What sort of a guy does that? What you do in the bedroom is private. </p>\n<p>\n\"Who has a relationship with you and then does that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTV mogul Simon Cowell has insisted the scandal will not cost Tulisa her X Factor job as a judge on the hit ITV1 show. </p>\n<p>\nBut her stepmum said: \"She is hurting. How can anyone recover from something like this? </p>\n<p>\n\"When she meets someone in the future will they think of her as the girl who was in the sex tape? </p>\n<p>\n\"I really hope she will learn about her inner strength. </p>\n<p>\n\"She has not got to where she is now by being a softie. </p>\n<p>\n\"But she has come out of this week and she has put out a video giving her side. </p>\n<p>\n\"Not many people would have the guts or strength to do that.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\na.crick@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<h1>\nShe wants dad's love </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTULISA has been seeking love since her troubled childhood and desperately wants a man who will be a father figure to her, stepmum Mel believes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe series of touching photos below reveal moments in the early life of the girl who was to become a recording and TV star  showing her with dad Plato and N-Dubz bandmates. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4217143/Tulisa-sues-ex-lover-MC-Ultra-over-release-of-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa's sex tape gag on ex-lover"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4215256/Tulisa-Contostavlos-news-Singers-new-raunchy-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa's latest sex tape"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4210623/Tulisa-news-X-Factor-judge-claims-sex-tape-shows-her-and-ex-boyfriend-Justin-Edwards.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4205864/Tulisa-sex-tape-X-Factor-judge-is-dragged-into-storm.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa is dragged into sex vid storm"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNN2505STEP53262_1477384a.jpg","caption":"Heartbreak ...

Even then he only publicly acknowledged Jonathan's existence in an interview in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nJonathan, who lives in America, was convinced his dad would come to see him as he grew up, and would sing his hits to his mum. He said: \"I'd lie in bed imagining doing normal stuff with him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I thought he'd walk through the door, sit down and explain to me where he'd been.

I didn't have to kiss anyone for the first six months but then it was Victoria Sugden I kissed first. </p>\n<p>\n\"You just have to prepare yourself for it and forget people are watching. </p>\n<p>\n\"I won't miss kissing blokes. I haven't got a problem with it but I don't think I'll be reminiscing!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut the storylines have had their plus points, Danny admitted, as they never made his real-life girlfriend  former Emmerdale star Kirsty-Leigh Porter  jealous. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Kirsty has never got jealous because I've been kissing lads for three years. Though that could all change now. But because she's an actress she's understanding.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut things could change when Kirsty hears who Danny's dream leading lady is  and it isn't her. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It would be Angelina Jolie I think. It might be too weird working with Kirsty again!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFans of the soap will see Aaron's last appearance on Thursday, April 5. </p>\n<p>\nAnd he says they were the most emotional scenes he has ever filmed. </p>\n<p>\nHe told TV Biz: \"On my final day it was very teary-eyed because the others set me off. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's the realisation it's the last scene you're going to do there. The tears in the final scenes are real tears. You can't hold it back. The realisation I was leaving just kicked in. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll miss everyone  there is not one bad person on Emmerdale's cast or crew. I'll miss Kelvin Fletcher, who plays Andy Sugden, and Adam Thomas, who plays Adam Barton, a lot.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAaron's storylines have touched upon violence, homophobia, euthanasia and even self-harm. </p>\n<p>\nSo Danny took up running to cope with the stress. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Aaron has had an emotional rollercoaster. I have to go running and burn off the emotion at the end of the day. You have to leave the building and leave the emotion there. </p>\n<p>\n\"Crying from Monday to Friday can get draining but you have to learn to leave it behind. You have to go and get rid of it by having a run.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hardest time on Emmerdale for Danny was when producer Gavin Blyth passed away in November 2010. He died in a matter of weeks after being diagnosed with Lymphoma cancer. </p>\n<p>\nDanny said: \"Gavin's death hit everyone very hard. It was such a shock. </p>\n<p>\n\"He got cancer then a month and a bit later he just died. </p>\n<p>\n\"He was like a father figure for me. I looked up to him and he helped me play the great storylines. He nurtured me. He was a very talented young man. He was there 24/7 for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"He stood by his word and he stood by me and said he'd support me and he did. We all miss him so much.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLeaving Emmerdale was a tough decision for Danny but now he wants to get into more dramas. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It was hard leaving. I could have stayed there for ever but I want to branch out. </p>\n<p>\n\"I love Sherlock  I'm the biggest fan of Benedict Cumberbatch. He's unbelievable. Gritty roles like Dominic West's as serial killer Fred West in Appropriate Adult would be a dream come true.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWorking on soaps is notoriously hard work and Danny is excited about the idea of spending more time on scenes and developing his acting. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"The likes of Pauline Quirke and people who've been in dramas  they come in and they don't know how we do it, 16 scenes a day. </p>\n<p>\n\"You've got ten hours to do all those scenes. It's a massive reality check. You don't have six hours to spend on a scene.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It annoys me when people are snobby about soaps. People come up to me and say, 'I don't watch it and its sh*t.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It's pretty disrespectful because that's my job. It's something we do day in, day out, week in week out, not like a film. </p>\n<p>\nBefore Danny auditions for any new roles he plans to get his driving licence. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It's ironic. I play a mechanic but I've been too busy to learn to drive.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut down whichever road his career takes him, Danny is thrilled to have been part of Emmerdale. </p>\n<p>\n<i>He said: \"The years have flown by. But they do say time flies when you're having fun.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/dancing_on_ice/4215095/Matthew-Wolfenden-news-Emmerdale-actor-says-hell-dedicate-Dancing-On-Ice-win-to-co-star-Charley-Webb-if-he-wins.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Matthew Wolfenden: Charley was a skate help"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/dancing_on_ice/4210522/Matthew-Wolfenden-news-Emmerdale-star-to-perform-Singing-In-The-Rain-for-Dancing-On-Ice-final.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Matthew Wolfenden is singin' in the reign"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4210181/Doctor-Who-news-Jenna-Louise-Coleman-struggled-to-keep-job-as-Matt-Smiths-assistant-secret.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jenna-Louise Coleman can breathe a sci-fi of relief"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/4203508/Emmerdale-actress-Natalie-Anderson-is-to-become-a-mum.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Baby joy for Emmerdale's Natalie Anderson"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/4191916/Emmerdale-cast-turn-rap-stars-for-Danny-Miller-leaving-party.html?iPadApp=true"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNF25DANN-532_1477200a.jpg","caption":"Emotional ...

It followed her own near-death experience when she gave birth to new daughter Hollie. </p>\n<p>\nBut show insiders last night insisted Amanda meant no offence to the Delilah singer, adding: \"She has the utmost respect for Tom.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA fierce spat erupted between the rival show's stars before they clash in a ratings war tonight. </p>\n<p>\nAmanda, 41, joins boss Cowell and fellow judges Alesha Dixon and David Walliams on the ITV1 show. </p>\n<p>\nLast night Cowell  who had been criticised by Sir Tom over his right to judge singers  hit back at the Welsh crooner's ability to pick wannabe stars. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Most artists who try and run record labels fail. That's why they are artists. Can a singer judge another singer as well as a record executive?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe music tycoon also blasted \"petty\" Beeb bosses over the scheduling clash, laying the blame firmly at their door. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They're the ones who seem to be making it into a battle. We were always going to air in March because of my timings. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"The BBC are doing this as the more they talk about us the more headlines they get. But I don't like it when the shows clashes. It is petty scheduling.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut BBC1 controller Danny Cohen played down the battle for viewers, saying: \"I'm not going to put a number on what we see as success for The Voice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday Cowell said this year's BGT will be the best ever, erasing memories of last year's uninspiring run. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"There's a mixture of good and what I call good old-fashioned British eccentricity. </p>\n<p>\n\"The best way to judge the show is not to take it too seriously, but the good ones are always going to get through and that is the important thing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>With a glint in his eye, he added: \"There will be some strippers of course  one or two.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he said there will be nine acts in the semi-final instead of eight, ensuring even more talent gets through. </p>\n<p>\nSimon, 52, also sang the praises of Walliams, 40  who rose to fame alongside Matt Lucas in BBC1 comedy Little Britain. Cowell said: \"I've been trying to get David to do this show for the past two years. There were these two bellringers last year and I texted him saying: 'It's you and Matt!'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Some of his characters on Little Britain are like some of our contestants. I thought he'd really fit into that kind of British eccentric humour. He's been a revelation.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nl.holmwood@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Big Jon's a belter </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b><br></br></b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nUNLIKELY singing duo Jonathan and Charlotte have the judges wincing when they wander on to the BGT stage  but leave to a standing ovation. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nBulky Jonathan and his pretty auburn partner, who were introduced by their singing teacher, impressed all four judges with their performance. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSimon says: \"Wow, wow, wow.

At the end of the day it is always up to the viewers.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nHe added: \"With some other shows, like BGT, all kinds of talent comes on. But The Voice is purely about what people sound like  that's the unique thing.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSir Tom  on the show with fellow mentors Will.i.am, Jessie J and Danny O'Donoghue  had warmed up for tonight's ratings fight by taking a stinging swipe at Simon Cowell. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe Welsh legend insisted ITV show guru Cowell was NOT a good judge of singers because he has NEVER had a go himself. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nSir Tom said: \"I have problems when people who have never got up on a stage to sing judge those who do. Who are they to say? </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"Simon Cowell is a record man, not a singer. How can someone give advice if he or she is not qualified? </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"The shows with judges from other areas of show business are all very well and good. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"But The Voice is unique because the four coaches are all singers, can all make records and know what they're talking about.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe Sex Bomb and It's Not Unusual star believes he already has five potential winners lined up.

I have never had to do that before in my life. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"When I have watched other talent shows and seen people getting all emotional, I thought that it was just showbusiness. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n\"But when you are there, you realise how difficult it is.

She should have been the biggest star in the world. She should have had the coolest freaking music. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's like they put them out, juice them, juice them, juice them, and give people something to watch on TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then, who is making sure she has the right material? That is wrong.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCher's album gets a US release next month but Will still reckons he will be more dedicated to helping the acts he guides on the UK version of The Voice, which kicks off tonight at 7pm. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I told every person on my team that I am going to try my hardest to see their career is jumpstarted or revitalised regardless of whether they win or not.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWill.i.am described the panel on The Voice  which also includes Tom Jones, Jessie J and The Script's Danny O'Donoghue  as like \"hungry people fighting over a steak, the fangs are drawn\". But the US producer does fear ruining a contestant's chances in the industry if he gets it wrong. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"There is a fear of that. We could mess up these people's careers.\" Will.i.am, who is pals with Cheryl Cole, who he manages, admitted he would stop at nothing to win the show but was tight-lipped about which stars he will be inviting on to the series. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I don't want to reveal my tricks. I'm just trying to do as much as I can, I swear to God, including technology and people.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe confessed that show bosses asked him and Jessie J to ramp up their banter during filming to boost ratings but both refused. Will said: \"Before the cameras went on before the first day they asked us to turn it up for TV and Jessie told me, 'I'm not going to do that for TV ratings, that's fake.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We said it to each other, then two days in the crews were like, 'Thanks a lot'  but then the banter was real.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite claiming he is mentoring four potential superstars, Will.i.am is worried about competing against \"legend\" Tom Jones because he knows every trick in the book. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I think I have about four people who are really big, out of the ten in my team  four big global artists. </p>\n<p>\n\"Out of all the singers, I am nervous about Tom's team. Me and my team, we have a lot of homework to do for the real live battles.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he reckons TV viewers will vote for the acts purely based on their voice  after the huge success of Brit Adele. </p>\n<p>\nHe claims she forced people to forget about \"the industry mould of the model figure\". </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4215256/Tulisa-Contostavlos-news-Singers-new-raunchy-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tulisa's latest sex tape"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4213815/2Shoes-to-lose-2-stone-after-scoring-record-deal.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"2Shoes 'to lose 2 stone after scoring record deal'"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4212851/X-Factor-boss-Simon-Cowell-stands-by-Tulisa-Contostavlos-over-sex-tape.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Cowell: Sex tape Tulisa hasn't blown her job"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4210623/Tulisa-news-X-Factor-judge-claims-sex-tape-shows-her-and-ex-boyfriend-Justin-Edwards.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4203674/X-Factor-is-going-back-to-basics.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"X Factor is going back to basics"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/britain_got_talent/4215607/Britains-Got-Talent-news-Simon-Cowells-BGT-and-williams-The-Voice-go-head-to-head-in-the-ratings-as-shows-start.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Amanda Holden: Sir Tom could be dead in a week"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/sico-532_1476931a.jpg","caption":"Let down ...

I thought, 'Here we go... people are going to say he can't skate, he's getting his body out for the vote,' and I've had a real problem with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, after asking fans what they thought, he reluctantly agreed. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Then I thought to myself, 'Let the voting public decide.'

So I thought, 'OK, let's do it then.'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Chico has insisted on changes to the dance moves as weeks of training have left him with a bad back and a weak wrist. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I am having nightmares about it, to be honest. I have a back problem that I've got from the show and in all the weeks it had to come back  it's this week. </p>\n<p>\n\"I can't do one lift, I've had to change it because of my wrist  it's the seat lift where your hand is right up her bum! </p>\n<p>\n\"I managed to get her so far up but they wanted it travelling and turning and my wrist can't handle it so we had to change it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Chico admits he is pleased with his second routine  he is skating to Happy Days and will be dressed as The Fonz.

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

It's called good management.\n</p>\n<p>\nManchester United have more to lose than City do with Tevez coming back because Ferguson will know full well that he is the sort of player who can turn tight games in his side's favour If he wasn't worried about City, would he even be talking about them?\n</p>\n<p>\nAlready, we have seen how Tevez set up the winner for Samir Nasri in City's 2-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday at a time when they needed a spark.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou don't cut off your nose to spite your face and when you've a good player like Tevez you'd be crazy not to use him.\n</p>\n<p>\nOK, Roberto Mancini had to be careful not to lose face in a situation where he had said Tevez would never play for the club again after he had refused to go on as a substitute.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut once Tevez apologised why wouldn't you bring him back? Ferguson is wrong, it's not desperation, just common sense.\n</p>\n<p>\nDoes he believe that Tevez should really never play for City again just because Mancini said he wouldn't after he refused to go on the pitch at Bayern Munich?\n</p>\n<p>\nFerguson has been around long enough to know things change and if you're going to apply those high standards then you had better make sure you are consistent.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember it was only last September that Paul Scholes revealed that he had refused to play for United in a League Cup tie against Arsenal in 2001.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was no question at the time of Scholesy's United career being over even though he later admitted that what he had done was as bad  if not worse  than Tevez's actions.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou have to move on in football. Things happen in the heat of the moment but if people are calm and reasonable they can be worked out.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt might have suited United if Tevez didn't play for City for the rest of the season because he is a talent who increases their attacking options.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Ferguson will be fully aware of Tevez's capabilities having worked with him at United.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe might have allowed him to leave Old Trafford but that doesn't mean he didn't rate him as a player.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe wouldn't have appreciated his carry-on when he tried to put pressure on him to give him a new contract but he will be aware of what an asset is he is on the pitch.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fact that he made such a quick impact on his return to the fold will quell any discontent the City fans might feel about his behaviour and he has a role to play in the run-in.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe might not start but he doesn't need to because he reminds me of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in his ability to get up to speed in a game almost as soon as he came on.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember that was his first game in five months and he still made his mark. Adrenaline could carry him through until the end of the season even if his fitness is not completely up to the mark.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe only reason Ferguson felt the need to have a pop at Tevez was because the mind games have started, the sure sign a title race has entered the title straight.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce Patrick Vieira said bringing back Scholes was an act of desperation, he was always going to react.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's what he does, defend his club and his players. I think he gets a buzz off it.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome sports people like Muhammad Ali and Usain Bolt thrive off being in the headlines and creating them and I think Ferguson is the same.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn years gone by, we've seen him lock horns with Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle but this is a different ball game because the challenge is right on his doorstep.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe tried to put them down as 'noisy neighbours' before but City have kept coming and got stronger and stronger.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited feel threatened, there's no doubt about that.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the past, Ferguson has got into rows with Arsene Wenger, Rafa Benitez and Kevin Keegan but the key is that his side have always been able to back him up.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited have walked the walk after he talked the talk so he hasn't been left with egg on his face.\n</p>\n<p>\nWouldn't it be a desperate irony if what he said about a former player came back to haunt him when the two sides meet on April 30?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nDon't be so Kean\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<h2>\nSTEVE KEAN is getting a lot of plaudits right now  and, on the face of it, things have taken a turn for the better at Blackburn Rovers.\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThree months ago, Blackburn were rooted to the foot of the table and the local paper and MP had both called on him to quit.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's not to mention the fans whose opposition was so aggressive that he had hired a bodyguard.\n</p>\n<p>\nThings have improved a bit in the meantime.\n</p>\n<p>\nA run of five wins and three draws in 12 games has seen them climb off the foot of the table to 16th.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey are a full five points clear of the relegation zone and seem to have a bit of momentum that other sides have lacked. That is despite having to work under difficult circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\nHis best player, Chris Samba, decided he did not want to play and was sold to Russian side Anzi after the English transfer window shut.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut can we actually say he is doing well just because they are no longer in the bottom three?\n</p>\n<p>\nTo me, it looks like Kean might be helped by the fact that other sides are not as competitive as in previous years.\n</p>\n<p>\nWolves and Wigan have taken just 22 points and Bolton only a point more.

He has everything you need, I'm sure he has a bright future for Arsenal and England. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"He's shown that already in a couple of games. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He has pace, he is clever, knows when to pass, when to keep the ball and has good technique. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"He's a bit like Rooney, who I rate highly. Rooney's a big player and a good all-rounder who can score goals, provide assists and make nice runs  he has a bit of everything. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"And although Alex plays on the left or right  whereas Rooney plays more through the middle  that could change in the future. They are both good all-round players.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nVan Persie is the man currently firing the Gunners to glory. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis season has been his best in an Arsenal shirt with 33 goals to his name already but the 28-year-old Holland ace credits his team-mates and Wenger for making his scoring heroics possible. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"I've been working with Arsene Wenger for eight years now and he's been a big influence on me, together with the team and the club. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"That's everyone from the kitman to the manager  they all help each other. Lots of my achievements are down to the rest of the players because, without them, I'm nothing. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not doing anything differently  I still love to play football and train but for the last 18 months I've been able to play week in, week out. You can see the results. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Hopefully, I can stay in this form and keep it going.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nVan Persie's scoring exploits have made him a frontrunner with bookies for this season's Player-of-the-Year accolade. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut he joked: \"I've paid them off! We'll see. It would be special if I was picked as a candidate but that's for later.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>ROBIN VAN PERSIE was helping film the new Mars advert for their 'Play Your Part for England' campaign.

We are disappointed to have dropped two points but it's still a good result. Every point is valuable.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCrouch's goal will live long in the memory as he teed up the ball with his right foot and delivered an incredible angled volley from wide outside the area.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I knew as soon as it left my foot I had a good chance.

He insists that is his strength.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd sitting with him, listening to him, debating with him... you tend to agree.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor here is a man who dares to be different, someone who will do it his way or die trying and you cannot help but admire that.\n</p>\n<p>\nAsked to describe himself, he replied: \"I am young and free-thinking with new ideas and a new positivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I am an attacking player. I am young and fresh and I want to prove myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I am someone who is trying to champion a new way of playing  in my team, in my national team and in my career.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSee, told you he was not shy in coming forward.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut there's more.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike his attitude to replacing the suspended Rooney in Poland and Ukraine.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"That's not going to faze me at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You only have one football career and in 10 years' time I don't want to look back and be depressed because I didn't achieve my targets. So I believe I can do it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Wayne Rooney is obviously a world-class player, everyone knows that. But the one thing that's always driven me on is that desire to succeed, to be the best I can be. So I would love the opportunity.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe might just get it.\n</p>\n<p>\nSturridge was voted man of the match for England against the Netherlands at Wembley last month, despite coming on only as a first-half substitute and then hobbling off injured before the end.\n</p>\n<p>\nEcstasy and agony in the same memorable moment.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe recalled: \"I was having a needle prodded into my toe at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It was the Chelsea osteopath who told me I had got man of the match and I sort of snapped, 'Do you mind? I'm in a lot of pain right now'.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I just didn't believe him and it wasn't until I was leaving the stadium and was asked to do an interview that I realised it was true. Obviously, I was very pleased. They were my first serious minutes as an England player and I had done well at Wembley in front of so many great fans. That's a dream for every player.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And you can be sure I won't be opening that bottle of champagne, that's one for the mantelpiece  I just wish I had got it signed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSturridge had a face like thunder when he was subbed for Fernando Torres in the thrilling Champions League win over Napoli the other night.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he would have been miserable consigned to the bench in this week's 2-1 loss at former club Manchester City.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe has nothing personal against &#163;50million Torres, nor Drogba for that matter.\n</p>\n<p>\nStudge just wants to be the main man down the middle for Chelsea.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe insisted: \"That's the position I will always pick myself, centre-forward.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd added, less convincingly: \"But whatever position the manager picks me in I'm happy and right now, for the team, I'm in the wide position.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I will always give 100 per cent and work as hard as I can to get the success we all want.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSturridge is used to battling for recognition and respect since his early days growing up in the Jewellery Quarter of Birmingham. He said: \"I grew up in Hockley and was always surrounded by older kids and grown-ups.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My brother is older than me and I was always playing with him and his friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I was never in my own age group. I was always with the older lads but I didn't feel shy around them or inferior. I wasn't scared playing against them. I just wanted to prove myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Even then I wanted to be the best I could be. I was always trying to improve, to learn. I think that's what's given me so much confidence now in my own ability.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And that's why I will always try to express myself, even if I'm feeling less confident because I'm maybe having a bad patch.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Because I know everyone has bad times in every job, in everyone's life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Everything doesn't run as smoothly as you would like all the time. So you have to persevere, believe and work as hard as you can to change what you are going through, to stay grounded and fully focused.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is especially true amid the inevitable uncertainty when you do not have a permanent manager at either club or country.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Yes, it's a strange feeling. But it comes with the territory, it's part of football, part of life.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You just try to move forward as a group, whether it's with England or Chelsea.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBy moving on, he actually means aiming for the stars with the Blues and the Three Lions.\n</p>\n<p>\nChelsea are chasing the Champions League, FA Cup and a top-four finish, ensuring a dramatic climax to the season. Then come the Euros.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Dan the Man said: \"At Chelsea we want to finish the season off as well as we can, we have some big games coming up and if we can finish the season with some silverware it would be fantastic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I am confident.

Sol Campbell</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE former England defender was the ultimate freebie. </p>\n<p>\nRaised from a youth player to club captain at Tottenham, Campbell incensed the White Hart Lane faithful by moving to Arsenal in 2001 for absolutely nothing. </p>\n<p>\nHe proved to be an excellent signing for Arsene Wenger and helped the Gunners to two Premier League titles and three FA Cup trophies. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2. Demba Ba</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nGOALSCORERS in the Premier League are a priceless commodity that usually cost top whack. </p>\n<p>\nAnd for that reason, Newcastle have been laughing all the way to the bank since picking up Ba for free after West Ham's relegation. </p>\n<p>\nThe ex-Hoffenheim forward is on 16 league goals and counting this campaign which really puts the likes of &#163;50million Fernando Torres and &#163;35m Andy Carroll to shame. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3. Brad Friedel</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIT took Friedel a while to find his feet in the Premier League. </p>\n<p>\nBut what an impact he made when he finally got to grips with England's top flight. </p>\n<p>\nAfter a disappointing spell at Liverpool, the American moved to Blackburn on a Bosman and proved himself to be one of the most dependable keepers to grace these shores  as Tottenham observed when snapping him up on a free from Aston Villa last summer. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4. Jay-Jay Okocha</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSAM ALLARDYCE was at his wheeler-dealing best when he brought in Okocha. </p>\n<p>\nHis big-money move to PSG hadn't worked out and he was allowed to leave when his contract expired, opening the door for Allardyce's charm offensive. </p>\n<p>\nBig Sam convinced the Nigerian that the Reebok Stadium was the place to be and Okocha went on to become a darling of the Trotters' faithful. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5. Kevin Davies</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIF Bolton's signing of Okocha was left-field, then picking up Davies when his career had hit rock bottom seemed plain crazy. </p>\n<p>\nIt proved to be a stroke of genius though as Allardyce transformed the former Blackburn flop into a bruising centre-forward that no one fancied playing against. </p>\n<p>\nDavies may be in the twilight of his career now but he has been a loyal servant to Wanderers over the last nine years and was rewarded with an England cap in October 2010. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6. Mark Schwarzer</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAGED 35 and out of contract at Middlesbrough, few could be forgiven for thinking Schwarzer's best days were behind him. </p>\n<p>\nBut the Aussie stopper proved the doubters wrong when he signed for Fulham and became one of the most consistent keepers in the league. </p>\n<p>\nHe played a pivotal role in the Cottagers run to the Europa League final in 2010 and was even the subject of a failed &#163;2m bid from Arsenal the following summer. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>7. Gary McAllister</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE average central-midfielder is over the hill by 35  but McAllister was no ordinary player. </p>\n<p>\nThe bald Scot was 20 years into a stellar career when Gerard Houllier offered him the opportunity of a shock switch to Liverpool. </p>\n<p>\nMcAllister grabbed it with both hands and became an integral member of the Reds' quintuple-winning season. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>8. Ivan Campo</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDAVID LUIZ'S bushy-haired bretheren loved his loan spell at Bolton so much, he gave up life in sunny Spain to sign for the Trotters in 2003. </p>\n<p>\nCampo fitted in perfectly with the physicality of English football and became yet another of Allardyce's bargain buys. </p>\n<p>\nThe Spaniard may have won two Champions League titles during his time at Real Madrid, but he'll always have a stronger rapport with the Bolton fans after five years at the Reebok. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>9. Sylvain Distin</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nYOU have to wonder if Distin regrets leaving Manchester City, just as the times were getting good. </p>\n<p>\nProbably not, considering City were still chopping and changing their manager while he was winning the FA Cup with Portsmouth. </p>\n<p>\nThe French star formed a rock-solid partnership with fellow freebie Sol Campbell at Pompey and was so good that the South-Coast club even made a tasty &#163;5m profit on him when he moved to Everton. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>10. Mathieu Flamini</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nFLAMINI'S career underlines the power players received after the creation of the Bosman ruling. </p>\n<p>\nThere was no room for sentiment as the Frenchman left Marseille for nothing to sign for Arsenal in 2004 and then repeated the process four years later to head to AC Milan. </p>\n<p>\nDespite leaving the Gunners profitless, Flamini was still a bargain signing for the North Londoners who used his versatility to great effect in their run to the 2006 Champions League final. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/ba_1476555a.jpg","caption":"BA OF GOLD ...

And when the news of Bolton's victory finally filtered through to Bethnal Green, I'm sure it would have meant the world to him. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTo know there was a little light at the end of the tunnel in his club's own fight for survival. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNo doubt, he was kicking every ball. And, as best he could, joining in the applause. </p>\n<p>\nAnd so everyone connected with Bolton finally got on with life yesterday. It was a day when even the sun came out for 23-year-old Muamba. </p>\n<p>\nThe Reebok is not known for the clemency of its weather. </p>\n<p>\nSituated as it is underneath the aptly-named Winter Hill, it's one of the bleakest spots in the country, chill winds invading the very marrow of your bones. </p>\n<p>\nYesterday, though, it was bathed in sunshine. Suddenly, we were in Bolton-sur-mer. Smiling faces all round, girls in shorts and fans from both clubs gathered to see their teams do exactly as Muamba had wished  to get on with the game. </p>\n<p>\nOutside the stadium, they read the messages of support. </p>\n<p>\nOn the ground outside the main reception area, there were shirts from probably every club in the land. And all with the same message. </p>\n<p>\nGet well soon, Fabrice. Keep fighting. We're thinking of you. </p>\n<p>\nStrangely, there was a sign on the wall saying In Remembrance. </p>\n<p>\nThankfully, this is not the case for young Fabrice, following his near-miraculous and ongoing recovery after his heart effectively stopped for 78 minutes last weekend. </p>\n<p>\nThere were further tributes to a player referred to as Lionheart. And an England shirt with the words Bulldog Spirit. </p>\n<p>\nAll very British and gung-ho. </p>\n<p>\nExcept Muamba is far from your average football player. He is a one-off, a man of his own making. </p>\n<p>\nIt takes a special person to arrive at a tender age from a country at war like the Congo and settle as well as he did. </p>\n<p>\nTo learn a foreign language in quick time and go on to pass three A levels. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the whole time making an impression on the football pitch. Everyone has talked of what a delight Muamba is, considerate, patient and without a trace of conceit or envy. </p>\n<p>\nHow he has a kind word for everyone. </p>\n<p>\nAnd also the time to take an Open University course in accountancy and attend church every Sunday. </p>\n<p>\nAs I said, far removed from the public perception of a Premier League footballer. </p>\n<p>\nThis, more than anything, is why we had a packed Reebok yesterday. Some 26,901, the biggest crowd of the season. </p>\n<p>\nThey had come to cheer their team and also say thank you. Thank you for Muamba being spared. And thank you for that rarity  a gentleman in sport. With the emphasis on 'gentle'. </p>\n<p>\nAs the players walked out, we were supposed to start our minute's applause. But it had already started. </p>\n<p>\nAnd prompted, fair play to them, by the chants of \"Fabrice Muamba\" from the visiting fans. </p>\n<p>\nAs the applause continued, fans in the sun-drenched East Stand held up cards spelling \"Muamba 6\". </p>\n<p>\nHigh to their right, the big screen recalled highlights of his career. And still the applause rang out. Then it was down to the other business of the day. And even there the sun radiated down on Bolton. </p>\n<p>\nDavid Wheater powered home one header after 28 minutes, then another seven minutes later. And all was well with the world. </p>\n<p>\nThe name of the absent hero once again reverberated round the stadium. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, these things never quite work to script. So we had Blackburn's Steven Nzonzi pulling one back with over half an hour left and high anxiety gripping the home fans. </p>\n<p>\nThen, after a seeming eternity, a blast on referee Andre Marriner's whistle announced it was over and Bolton were out of the bottom three. </p>\n<p>\nYes, salvation may still be some way off. </p>\n<p>\nBut for Bolton and Fabrice Muamba, yesterday was another good day on the road to recovery. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nsteven.howard@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4216527/Bolton-2-Blackburn-1-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Bolton 2 Blackburn 1"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214991/Nigel-Reo-Coker-says-Fabrice-Muamba-opened-his-eyes-and-said-All-right-Nige.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fab opened his eyes, saw me and said: 'All right, Nige..?'"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214099/Owen-Coyle-Fabrice-Muambas-recovery-from-collapse-can-inspire-Bolton.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Owen: Muamba can inspire us"}],"video":[{"uri":"MyYmE5NDpAo1vpl3rM7gCwX9iCERsK_c","caption":"OWEN COYLE reveals ill Bolton star sent good luck note to team-mates"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton1_840x420_1477348a.jpg","caption":"SHOW OF SUPPORT ... fans spell out Fabrice Muamba's name in card tribute ahead of kick-off yesterday"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton5_532x780_1477353a.jpg","caption":"FRONT MAN ... matchday programme"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton4_23_532x_1477352a.jpg","caption":"SPUR-FECT ... supporters thank Tottenham"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton3_23_532x_1477350a.jpg","caption":"PICTURE POWER ... young fans hail Fab"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton7_22_532x_1477360a.jpg","caption":"COME BOK SOON ... tributes outside the Reebok"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton2_22_532x_1477349a.jpg","caption":"LORD'S PRAYER ... supporter gives thanks"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/72_bolton6_22_532x_1477356a.jpg","caption":"KIT OF ALL RIGHT ... youngster wears Fab jersey"}]},"isArticle":true},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"TIGHT AT THE TOP ...

The injured Sergio Aguero was replaced by Edin Dzeko and Carlos Tevez was again on the bench but the visitors did control the early possession. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was not until the ninth minute that Gael Clichy found space to deliver a ball into the Stoke box but Asmir Begovic claimed easily. </p>\n<p>\nStoke had their first opening after a free-kick was crossed to the back post for Crouch but Cameron Jerome was unable to turn his downward header goalwards. </p>\n<p>\nAt the other end, David Silva and Pablo Zabaleta both had efforts deflected wide and Yaya Toure shot over from distance. </p>\n<p>\nDean Whitehead was given a talking to by referee Howard Webb after catching Silva with his arm challenging for a high ball, with play held up while the Spaniard received treatment. </p>\n<p>\nStoke almost took the lead in the 41st minute when a Matthew Etherington corner was met by a deft glancing header from Ryan Shawcross but Pablo Zabaleta cleared off the line. </p>\n<p>\nMario Balotelli broke through as the first half went into injury time but shot tamely at Begovic. </p>\n<p>\nDzeko had a chance to break the deadlock in the opening minute of the second half as he controlled a lofted pass from Barry, but he could not get it down quick enough to round Begovic. </p>\n<p>\nCameron Jerome was replaced by Jermaine Pennant in the 51st minute and Hart was forced to block an effort from Walters at point-blank range. </p>\n<p>\nStoke claimed the lead with a sensational strike from Crouch just before the hour. </p>\n<p>\nA long clearance from Begovic was headed on by the lanky front man, before he took the return from Pennant, flicked it up and twisted to volley over Hart and into the top corner. </p>\n<p>\nMancini reacted by sending on Adam Johnson for Silva and then Tevez for Barry in the hope of gaining more width. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Yaya Toure from a central position - a non-threatening 35 yards out - who sledgehammered in the equaliser. </p>\n<p>\nThe Ivorian's firecracker caught the head of Shawcross and it was enough to wrong-foot Begovic and slam into the net. </p>\n<p>\nPulis introduced Wilson Palacios in place of Etherington to shore up his side and Shawcross came close with a header that looped agonisingly over. </p>\n<p>\nYaya Toure came close at the death but another powerful effort from the all-action midfielder flew just over the top. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/crouch2_1477285a.jpg","caption":"PETER'S PERFECT ...

and halted Blackburn's revival. </p>\n<p>\nSteven Nzonzi nodded Rovers' consolation in a contest charged with feeling as it was Bolton;s first match since Fabrice Muamba's collapse last weekend. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStBolton manager Owen Coyle named an unchanged line-up from his side's last Premier League game as the Lancashire side aimed to put the emotion generated by Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest last week to one side against Blackburn at the Reebok Stadium. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith Muamba still in intensive care, none of Coyle's players took up the option of sitting the game out, instead committing themselves to try and gain three valuable points in pursuit of top-flight safety. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn have adopted a respectful tone in the build-up, but Steve Kean's men were chasing a third successive win and were also unchanged. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Bolton supporters applauded from the moment the montage of Muamba began, right through until the handshake, a stand full of placards reading 'Muamba 6' held up opposite the directors' box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was soon evident the Bolton fans would be in full voice and Mark Davies fed David Ngog, whose cross was scrambled out of the Rovers penalty area. </p>\n<p>\nMartin Petrov was inches away from finding Ngog with an intelligent through-ball that ended up running on to Paul Robinson. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov let fly himself a couple of minutes later and Robinson had to watch the ball carefully in flight before beating it away. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere was little doubt Petrov was keen to make an impression and the Bulgarian shrugged Jason Lowe off the ball rather too easily, only to roll a disappointing shot wide of the far post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton keeper Adam Bogdan was thankful Davies was on hand to clear after he dropped Robinson's deep free-kick in a packed penalty area. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNgog got his head to a Petrov cross at the other end, but his effort lacked power and Robinson gathered with ease. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson's diving header turned Petrov's deep cross away for a corner, which Bolton could make nothing of. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn should have had a penalty when in-form striker Junior Hoilett went charging into the box and was nudged over by Gretar Steinsson. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTV replays showed there had been contact with the man, and none with the ball, but referee Andre Marriner waved play on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBolton were indebted to Tim Ream, who slid in to ensure Yakubu did not get on the end of a Marcus Olsson cross that looked like presenting him with a tap-in. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd they immediately profited when Petrov crossed from the right and Steven Nzonzi only succeeded in flicking it on to David Wheater, who seemed as surprised as anyone when the ball ended up in the bottom corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPratley was just off target as Bolton tried to press home their advantage, although Yakubu was inches away from equalising as he rose to meet Olsson's cross with a powerful header that just went wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov's shot was touched behind by Robinson, which only offered Bolton the chance to cause more damage from the corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd this time there was no look of surprise as Wheater profited from Ryo Miyaichi's cross to power home his second. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBogdan did not pay the penalty for yet more poor handling and not long afterwards Scott Dann's diving far-post header landed in the side-netting. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson needed treatment within seconds of the re-start after he was caught from behind by Miyaichi. </p>\n<p>\nThe full-back was able to continue, although as he was ushered back on to the field Miyaichi curled narrowly over for Bolton. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWheater cleared after some slack play from Nigel Reo-Coker had almost put them in trouble and from the throw-in, Bogdan came to collect Nzonzi's back header. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNgog was close to a third for Bolton at the other end as he rose to meet Petrov's inswinging cross. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nDavies completely mis-kicked as he was presented with a shooting chance just outside the box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd Bolton were made to pay as Bogdan failed to shift Yakubu from his line of vision until it was far too late as the hosts attempted to defend Morten Gamst Pedersen's corner and Nzonzi took advantage to nod home. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt was breathless stuff and Davies should have restored Bolton's two-goal cushion when Miyaichi picked him out from the right, completely unmarked, six yards out. Somehow though, he glanced the header wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMartin Olsson barged Steinsson off the ball by the corner flag but Hoilett let the pull-back run under his foot. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBogdan needed treatment after taking a thud in the ribs from Yakubu. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn the meantime, David Dunn was introduced for Mauro Formica. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhen play began again, Davies carved out an excellent opportunity for Petrov, but his shot nearly struck the corner flag it was so far wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIvan Klasnic replaced Ngog 11 minutes from time as Petrov waited to take a corner which he eventually dropped on to Pratley's head. But he was off target too. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYakubu bundled Hoilett's near-post cross just the wrong side of the post. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBlackburn were now looking to take advantage of Bolton's anxiety and Yakubu was not far away with a close-range header two minutes from time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM MONDAY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214994/Steve-Kean-Dont-be-embarrassed-beating-Bolton-lads.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Steve is Kean to be mean"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214925/Karren-Bradys-football-diary.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Karren Brady's football diary"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4214991/Nigel-Reo-Coker-says-Fabrice-Muamba-opened-his-eyes-and-said-All-right-Nige.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fab opened his eyes, saw me and said: 'All right, Nige..?'"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/wheater3_1477183a.jpg","caption":"GRET IN THERE! ...

0 Tottenham 0","teaser":"CHELSEA missed the chance to move closer to the Champions League places after a stalemate at Stamford Bridge","timestamp":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 14:45:20 +0000","articlebody":"<p>\nCHELSEA missed the chance to move to within two points of Spurs in the race for the Champions League places after a stalemate at Stamford Bridge. </p>\n<p>\nIn a boring first half only Rafael van der Vaart came close to scoring but his double chance was saved by Petr Cech and then blocked by Ashley Cole. </p>\n<p>\nJuan Mata hit the post with a free-kick after the break as the Blues pressed for a much-needed win. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Tottenham who came closest to nicking victory through William Gallas, Emmanuel Adebayor and then Gareth Bale who crashed a header against the bar. </p>\n<p>\nBale again tested Cech with a dipping last-minute free-kick but it was to remain goalless  a result which suits Spurs more than the Blues. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFernando Torres was back on the bench as Didier Drogba returned to the Chelsea starting line-up. </p>\n<p>\nBut that change did little to ignite a surprisingly cagey opening. </p>\n<p>\nThe hosts looked the more threatening but any danger was well snuffed out by a Spurs defence without skipper Ledley King. </p>\n<p>\nScott Parker was his usual industrious self while Sandro was providing an effective shield in an unusually advanced role. </p>\n<p>\nBut in what has been such an exciting Premier League season the opening half of this London derby was a bore. </p>\n<p>\nDespite the Blues in desperate need for three points to close the gap on fourth-placed Spurs, both teams seemed too scared to lose. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nChelsea did have a half-hearted penalty appeal when Frank Lampard broke in the box and went tumbling under a challenge by WGallas but Martin Atkinson rightly waved play on. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Stamford Bridge had to wait until first-half injury time for the first real goalmouth action as Bale played in a neat ball to Luka Modric. </p>\n<p>\nHis deflected pull back found Van der Vaart ten yards out but the ball fell awkwardly on the Dutchman's right foot and he struck straight at Cech. </p>\n<p>\nCole then reacted quickly to block Van der Vaart's follow up and as the ball looped in the air, Adebayor could only head on to the roof of the net. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThings livened up a tad immediately after the break and Daniel Sturridge should have done better after Drogba headed him clear but he dragged his left-footed strike wide. </p>\n<p>\nAt the other end, Kyle Walker had Cech worried with a fierce right-footed drive after a lovely reverse pass by Bale but his effort crashed into the side of the net. </p>\n<p>\nRamires was up in arms after a coming together with Benoit Assou-Ekotto but Atkinson was again right to ignore the weakest of penalty claims. </p>\n<p>\nBoth sides were beginning to press forward with more purpose without either seriously threatening to get an opening goal. </p>\n<p>\nThat was until Juan Mata stepped up with a beautiful curling free-kick which had Brad Friedel beaten but struck his left post and bounced clear. </p>\n<p>\nThen Spurs  having hardly threatened all game  had three glorious chances which all went begging. </p>\n<p>\nFirst William Gallas headed over with a free header from a teasing Modric free-kick. </p>\n<p>\nThen Adebayor latched on to a Modric dink but he lost his balance after rounding Cech and Gary Cahill was back to clear his strike at an empty net. </p>\n<p>\nThe visitors were then cursing their luck as Bale crashed a header from a corner smack on to the bar and Adebayor again headed the rebound over. </p>\n<p>\nLampard tested his luck at the other end with a strike from distance as Chelsea ran out of ideas. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was Bale again who came closest with a last-minute free-kick which had Cech scrambling to save and secure at least a point for his side. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM

Arteta struck his effort into the wall. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn the hour, a quick thrown out by Wojciech Szczesny sent away Czech midfielder Rosicky, who fed Gervinho down the left, but his cut-back from the byline flew across the six-yard box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRosicky was central to the action now, with Given beating away his 25-yard drive. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn 65 minutes, Heskey was replaced by Weimann. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal soon made a double change as Ramsey and full-back Andre Santos came on for Gervinho and Gibbs. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Brazilian's first contribution on his return to action from a broken ankle was to give the ball away to Weimann, but the Austrian lost composure in the Arsenal box and fluffed his big chance, stabbing across goal and wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRamsey made space for a shot on the turn from the edge of the penalty area, but was just wide. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith 13 minutes left, Walcott was replaced - to a standing ovation - by Oxlade-Chamberlain, while for Villa, Alan Hutton came off and Eric Lichaj went into the overworked defence. </p><p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal were screaming for a penalty when Oxlade-Chamberlain scampered away down the right and went down under a sliding challenge from Stephen Ireland, but referee Phil Dowd correctly ruled the midfielder had just got the ball first. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArteta cracked home a 25-yard free-kick in stoppage time to round off a fine afternoon's work from Wenger's reborn side. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nArsenal: Szczesny, Sagna, Djourou, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Gervinho, van Persie.

With temperatures way up in the 90s Sri Lanka is like an oven.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's why SunSport columnist Graeme Swann has come up with his own six hit to make things bearable for England's tourists.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1) LAUGH A MINUTE </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMickey-taking and banter keeps spirits up. Tim Bresnan is a soft target as he never stops saying daft things. We were playing 20 Questions the other night and my secret person for people to guess was Alfred Nobel.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn that wonderful Yorkshire accent, Bressie protested: \"That's roobish. Can't have him  nobody's heard of him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"Surely you've heard of the Nobel Prize, Bressie?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But it's not a person, is it?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's typical Bres. On day one when it was 45 degrees in the shade he said: \"It's no different from Yorkshire, is this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery day now you hear people shouting at him: \"Is this like Keighley, mate?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2) TOP NOSH </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy maxim is usually to eat what the locals eat. They know how to cook curries and so on. I've never been worried about eating something spicy and I've been lucky with how few upset tummies I've had. Alastair Cook led me down a dark little back alley the other night.\n</p>\n<p>\nI thought he was taking to have me bumped off  but he showed me an amazing sushi restaurant.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3) XBOX EXCELLENCE </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 all the time on the Xbox. We're in teams  Broady and me against Bres and Jimmy Anderson. Broady's the best, so I nabbed him as my partner.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome of the lads play the FIFA football game. I'm the world's worst but I was playing Bres and secretly passed the console to Finny, who is brilliant.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo Newcastle suddenly started thrashing Leeds. At the end, I just said: \"Cheers, Bres.\" He still doesn't know it was Finny operating the controls.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4) HOME COMFORTS </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe toughest part is being away from my family. Sarah and I have a little lad called Wilf, who is one.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe's just started pushing himself along with his walker. I fear I'll miss his first steps so I'm desperately hoping he can wait another couple of weeks!\n</p>\n<p>\nSkype helps. He recognises me and he runs over to the screen  says \"Da, da, da\"  and runs off again!\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5) TOON LOON </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHotels show Prem matches. I saw Newcastle trounce Norwich 1-0 the other night!\n</p>\n<p>\nAlan Pardew has built a cracking team. Paul Collingwood is big Mackem but he's not around these days so there's nobody to gloat over when we win.\n</p>\n<p>\nKevin Pietersen goes on about Chelsea but he's not a great football fan. Jimmy is half-Arsenal and half-Burnley and has started shouting more about Arsenal recently  I wonder why. Broady could hardly contain himself when Forest beat Leeds 7-3.\n</p>\n<p>\nPoor Bressie. You've guessed it  he's a Leeds fan.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6) CULTURE VULTURE </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe're encouraged to rest and not spend much extra time in the sun. But I like sightseeing and exploring local culture.\n</p>\n<p>\nWandering the streets can be fun but absolutely manic as everyone loves cricket.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4216473/James-Anderson-says-England-are-lucky-to-still-be-No1-in-the-world.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"James reign cloud"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4213670/Kevin-Pietersen-Pakistan-trio-deserve-bans-for-spot-fixing.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"KP: What Pakistan trio did was inexcusable"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4214849/Kevin-Pietersen-wants-fix-cheats-thrown-out-for-good.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Ban 'em for life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4212473/Ravi-Bopara-injury-blows-Englands-Test-plans-apart.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Ravi injury rocks England plans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4211604/Matt-Prior-smashes-England-to-strong-win.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Prior smashes England to strong win"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4211340/ICC-Mohammad-Amir-must-focus-on-rehabilitation-first.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Amir must focus on rehabilitation"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/65_swann_1477110a.jpg","caption":"HOT STUFF ...
