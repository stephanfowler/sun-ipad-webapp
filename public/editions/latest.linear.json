Daughters Grace, 18, and Lauren, 23, are believed to have extinguished the flames. </p>\n<p>\nMargot, 86, said: \"I saw a lady dash into the garden. Her clothes were alight and the girls were trying to pull her clothes off her. They were upset and distraught.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDiane was fighting for life in hospital last night in a critical but stable condition. </p>\n<p>\nShe has 40 per cent burns to her arms, chest and back. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Last night politicians demanded Cabinet minister Francis Maude  who two days earlier had advised people to store fuel in jerry cans at home  must quit. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMaude gave his advice hoping to counter a threatened strike by tanker drivers. He told motorists: \"A bit of fuel in a jerry can in the garage is a sensible precaution.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he was blasted as irresponsible by experts. Labour MPs last night lined up to demand the Cabinet Office minister's resignation as the threat of fuel shortages receded. </p>\n<p>\nThe AA reported fresh incidents of motorists using \"desperate and dangerous\" attempts to store fuel. </p>\n<p>\nBut its president Edmund King said: \"Things are calming down. Drivers should revert to their normal fuel buying patterns.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is almost as if the last five days have been one big April Fool come early.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBP said demand eased after the Government scrapped earlier advice to motorists that they fill up. </p>\n<p>\nAn Asda spokeswoman said today: \"We have started to see the first signs of fuel buying patterns returning to normal. </p>\n<p>\n\"We'd like to thank our customers for heeding the advice of the AA and being sensible.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLabour backbencher John Mann said Mr Maude's \"rash and foolish\" advice had triggered panic. He said: \"Francis Maude should now be considering the consequences of his actions and do the decent thing. </p>\n<p>\n\"This is precisely what the Fire Brigade warned against.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nKarl Turner, MP for Hull East, said: \"If this lady has suffered these terrible injuries because she was following the advice handed out by Francis Maude then I sincerely believe he must resign. This woman has suffered life-changing injuries.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLabour peer Lord Harris  former chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority  said: \"This woman was following advice  and ends up with 40 per cent burns. Disgraceful.\" </p>\n<p>\nShadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: \"It was a political invention, the panic of the last couple of days, and the nation and some people are paying a very, very heavy price.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPM David Cameron offered Mrs Hill his sympathy. He said: \"This was a desperate incident. My heart goes out to her and her family.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>He spoke as the Unite union announced tanker drivers will not strike before Easter and not take any action until at least April 11.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt will hold talks with employers at conciliation service ACAS on Monday. But Unite, which represents around 2,000 tanker drivers, said it will still call industrial action if the talks break down. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDiane, who lives in a &#163;500,000 semi in York, had been decanting the petrol for her teenage daughter Grace, who feared her car was about to run out. </p>\n<p>\nTwo hours before the horror, Grace wrote online: \"I'm gonna be f***** if the petrol stations in York close cos I have zero money to top up &amp; I'm already flashing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLast night Diane's family  including husband Mark, 51  were at her hospital bedside in Wakefield. </p>\n<p>\nDiane's aunt Joan Simpson said: \"I'm not sure about whether or not Francis Maude should step down but I do know this has been handled really badly by the Government. This tragic event could have been avoided.\" </p>\n<p>\nFire Brigade Union boss Matt Wrack said Diane's injuries revealed the danger of Mr Maude's comments. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"The Government needs to issue urgent advice to warn the public before we have another incident, perhaps with worse consequences.\" Strict limits on tanker drivers' hours were relaxed last night so more fuel could be delivered. They can now spend 11 hours a day on the road instead of nine. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDrivers were still queuing to fill up yesterday. A holidaymaker returning to Eastbourne in a motorhome was denied fuel at a garage near <b>KYNANCE COVE</b>, <b>CORNWALL,</b> because she was not local. </p>\n<p>\nIn <b>BOURNEMOUTH</b>, <b>DORSET,</b> a petrol station was closed by police five minutes after a delivery when it became besieged by motorists. </p>\n<p>\nBut Chris Hunt, boss of the UK Petroleum Industry Association, blames drivers for the crisis. In a leaked email he said: \"It's unlike any crisis before, one we are inflicting on ourselves. It is the public getting into a feeding frenzy.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<i>g.wilson@the-sun.co.uk </a></i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nGranny tops up jam jars<br></br>\n</h1>\n<p>\nA PANIC-buying pensioner pulled into a petrol station yesterday to fill up 20 empty paint tins  and a tray of jam jars. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAn AA man saw the 75-year-old woman carefully squirting in fuel before putting the containers in her boot out of sight of staff in Macclesfield, Cheshire. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShe stopped when he told her of the danger. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile a family of four heading for the south coast in a hatchback had four ten-litre fuel containers in the vehicle  and asked an AA man if he had others to sell. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA woman in South Wales spilled fuel on a forecourt filling a narrow container. The AA said: \"The silliest thing we've seen is people up and down the country filling their cars when they didn't need to.\"\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Mary's Queen of the queues<br></br></b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\nQUEEN of Shops Mary Portas was Queen of Queues yesterday  waiting 30 minutes to fill up at a West London garage  just as her plans to revitalise our high streets got the go-ahead. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Lucy, 13 ticks off Premier<br></br></b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nAN angry schoolgirl emailed David Cameron demanding an apology after missing lessons yesterday because of the fuel fiasco. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThirteen-year-old Lucy Royce's mum Victoria drove her the seven miles to school in the morning  then realised she hadn't enough petrol to return for her in the afternoon. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSo she took her daughter and two sons back home again to Bridgnorth, Shropshire. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLucy said: \"It's really annoying. Mr Cameron goes on about education but now mine suffers  and it is his fault. He should phone my school and explain why I'm not there.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHer email accuses the PM of a \"severe error\" and \"misjudgment\". </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Easter fear<br></br></b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nDRIVERS planning Easter breaks could be left stranded if petrol panic buying continues, motoring experts warned last night. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAs two-hour queues and police closures were seen at forecourts across Britain, garage bosses said it could take a week to restock. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe RAC said long weekends due to start on Good Friday could be hit, even though a strike by tanker drivers has been ruled out for at least 11 days. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA spokesman said: \"The earliest that the strike could be happening would be in the second week of April so there's no need for anybody to be buying extra fuel for the holidays.

The hapless Labour leader admitted it was \"an incredibly disappointing result\". </p>\n<p>\nSeeking to calm party anger, he vowed: \"I'm going to go back to the constituency in the coming weeks to talk to people there about why this result happened.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut critics were furious at the ballot-box battering, which came despite a ten-point opinion poll lead and after David Cameron's worst week in power. </p>\n<p>\nEx-Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett told The Sun: \"The inquest will throw up a number of lessons that must be taken on board now, not in three years' time. We fail to learn them at our peril.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"It's astonishing anyone could cast a vote for someone who has gone on Big Brother and got down on his hands and knees to lick milk like a cat. </p>\n<p>\n\"Is our political system letting people down so badly they'll vote for any buffoon?\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith local and London mayor elections just over a month away on May 3, another senior party figure, who didn't want to be named, said: \"Bradford West is a wake-up call for Red Ed. He needs to change tack and show the party he can deliver in elections.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLabour campaign chiefs also came under fire. Labour MP John Mann fumed: \"We had no game plan, no strategy. But what was particularly disconcerting was having no Muslim doorknockers, no Urdu speaker, no hijab-wearing woman talking to Muslim women voters.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSenior Labour sources blamed \"local factors\"  but refused to say whether that meant ethnic issues or dirty campaigning. </p>\n<p>\nTory co-chairman Baroness Warsi also waded in to the row, saying the result cast a shadow over Labour's chances at the next election. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"This tells you everything you need to know about Ed Miliband's weak leadership.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Tory vote was also badly slashed in Bradford West  while the Lib Dems got so few votes they lost their &#163;500 deposit. </p>\n<p>\nGalloway boasted it was \"the most sensational victory in British political history\".\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"This is the Bradford Spring, just like the Cairo Spring and the Tunisian Spring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut there were fears it would split Bradford's mixed community along ethnic lines. </p>\n<p>\nProtester Thomas Johnson, 26, pelted eggs at the newly elected MP as he toured Bradford yesterday, sparking a scuffle. Mr Johnson shouted: \"He's a sycophant, a parasite on this city.\" But Galloway crowed: \"He didn't get me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGalloway won despite hardly ever setting foot in Bradford West. It came after the Catholic-born Scot wrote to all Muslim voters  claiming to be more religious that his \"moderate Muslim\" Labour rival. He poured doubt on the faith of barrister Imran Hussain, 33, by suggesting he drinks alcohol. </p>\n<p>\nGalloway also astonishingly claimed to have saved the people of Palestine and Iraq, and to be single-handedly fighting to free those of Afghanistan and Iran. The anti-war veteran, standing for the left-wing Respect Party, wrote: \"You should vote for him because he is a 'Muslim', they say, and because he is of Pakistani background... God knows who is a Muslim. And he knows who is not. Instinctively, so do you.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the same letter he claimed: \"I, George Galloway, do not drink alcohol and never have. </p>\n<p>\n\"Ask yourself if the other candidate in this election can say that.\" He said he had been given \"Pakistan's highest civil awards for services to democracy and for my work for the freedom of Kashmir\". There was no mention of his visit to Saddam Hussein when he told the despot: \"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNor did he talk of pretending to be a cat licking milk from actress Rula Lenska's hands in Big Brother. He claimed his letter was a response to the Labour campaign, \"which consisted of a claim that people should vote for him because he was a Pakistani Muslim\". </p>\n<p>\nThe by-election was sparked after Labour's Marsha Singh stepped down due to ill health. It was the second time Galloway snatched a seat from Labour, which expelled him in 2003. </p>\n<p>\nHe won in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005  but then lost to Labour in Limehouse and Poplar in 2010. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nt.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1>\nmyView<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h6>\nBy TOM NEWTON DUNN Political Editor </h6>\n<p>\nGEORGE Galloway's victory stopped Ed Miliband's revival in its tracks yesterday, like a .45 calibre bullet. </p>\n<p>\nThe rookie Labour leader was viewed by Westminster as having finally turned a corner in the last two weeks. </p>\n<p>\nSome decent Despatch Box performances capitalising on Cameron and Osborne's shambolic collapse gave him a golden opportunity to be heard. Bradford West may have ended that for good. </p>\n<p>\nThe worst thing for Labour about the jumbo drubbing is that its arrogant campaign chiefs had no clue it was coming  even as the polls closed on Thursday, Ed's aides were bragging to journalists about a comfortable win. </p>\n<p>\nThe party's ten-point lead in the polls is revealed to be as soft as French cheese. </p>\n<p>\nThere is a lesson today too for the Tories. As long as the bungling PM and his ministers are even more unpopular than Ed, they look extremely silly when they gloat. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1>\nmyView<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h6>\nBy ANILA BAIG in Bradford </h6>\n<p>\nGEORGE Galloway's victory has been described as a shock. </p>\n<p>\nBut looking around the constituency in which I live, the writing  on posters, hoardings and banners  was on the wall. And on cars, lampposts and any other surface, for that matter. </p>\n<p>\nIn Manningham, in the heart of Bradford, there was jubilation and not just because of Friday prayers. Young and old talked of \"a breath of fresh air\" and \"a new voice\". Taxi drivers beeped their horns, shouting: \"Respect! Respect!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMy phone was full of texts from 40-something friends calling his victory \"historic\". One sounded hysterical, claiming it was a huge honour that Gorgeous George chose to stand here. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's a turning point for Bradford, change is coming!\" she declared. She's not the only giddy one. At one house with a George poster in the window I was embraced by Maqsood Bi, 66, who said: \"He came and talked to us. I decided there and then I trusted him. We did vote Labour but we like his party. We support the people of Palestine and he helps people in trouble.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGalloway fashioned himself to look \"Muslim\". On Twitter he spoke of \"God willing\" and on banners, against a green backdrop  associated with Muslim countries  he is bearded and his balding pate looks like an Islamic skullcap. </p>\n<p>\nBut voters don't care whether he is Muslim or not. Law student Raja Tuqeer, 20, said: \"He was speaking a lot of sense.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe general feeling seems to be that Galloway ran rings round Imran Hussein and was more eloquent. No one seemed to even know who the Tory candidate was. </p>\n<p>\nPosing with his car, festooned in Galloway posters, Raja said: \"We celebrated at his office. There were 1,500 people there at 3am and most were 18 to 25. I wasn't interested in politics before but this feels right.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMarried Samsor and Elena Safi did not vote and were wary of Galloway's motives.

She told investigators: \"We all scattered.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBin Laden crossed into Pakistan in 2002, where he was reunited with his bride in Peshawar. </p>\n<p>\nAmal revealed they also hid out in Swat Valley near the Afghan border in accommodation arranged by Osama's elder son Saad. The pair moved on to Haripur, where she gave birth in the local hospital to daughter Aasia in 2003 and son Ibrahim a year later. In 2005 they switched to nearby Abbottabad, in a high-walled compound. </p>\n<p>\nAnother girl Zainab was born in 2006 and a boy Hussain in 2008. Bin Laden's first two wives rejoined him  and, like Amal, were held after he died, aged 54. </p>\n<p>\nAmal refused to say if the family had been in contact with any Pakistani officials while on the run. They want to deport her to Yemen for breaching a three-month visa when she initially arrived in Pakistan 12 years ago. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBin Laden's two other widows Khairia Hussain Sabir and Siham Sharif and their daughters, who all refuse to speak to investigators, face immigration charges next week. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nn.syson@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4203405/Osama-Bin-Ladens-wives-Amal-and-Khairiah-restrained-after-attacking-each-other-in-court.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Osama Bin Laden's wives in spat No2"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4195569/Osama-Bin-Laden-wives-pulled-apart-in-catfight.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Osama Bin Laden wives pulled apart in catfight"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4161228/Bin-Laden-hid-terror-codes-in-the-Bible.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Bin Laden hid terror codes in the Bible"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4156396/Pakistani-security-forces-destroy-former-house-of-Osama-Bin-Laden.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"It's Bin demolished"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4226438/Osama-Bin-Laydee.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Osama Bin Laydee"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/SNN0123BIN---532_1481403a.jpg","caption":"Family planning ...

Mr Guys told a news conference in Aberdeen: \"On February 25 we observed irregular pressure in the annuli (the space between the wellbore and its metal casing deep below the seabed.). </p>\n<p>\n\"We very quickly moved to kill the annuli pressure by pumping it full with high density mud. During this process, on March 25, we observed a sudden pressure increase followed by an escape of mud, then gas.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWorkers on the platform off Scotland's East Coast said they raised concerns about the well earlier this month  with trade unions claiming the men's fears had been \"fobbed off\". Details emerged yesterday suggesting it wasn't until March 4 that Total pumped heavy mud into the seabed in a bid to \"kill\" the well. </p>\n<p>\nTotal  whose share price is now at its lowest since December  said the source of the gas leak is a 13,000ft deep reservoir. Nearly 200,000 cubic metres of gas a day is escaping from the base of the platform. </p>\n<p>\nMr Guys said: \"We continue to observe the situation using satellites, surveillance spotter planes three times a day, and maintaining standby vessels in the vicinity of the installation.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSafety concerns were heightened by a flare blazing near the rig. Operators have now confirmed it has finally \"extinguished itself\". </p>\n<p>\nA statement from the company said: \"Total can this morning confirm that the flare on the Elgin platform has extinguished itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We received the first indication that the flare may be out at 12.07 yesterday from our first surveillance flight of the day. The news was then reaffirmed at 16.36 following our second flight of the day.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We received what we consider final confirmation at 08.20 this morning, when our sea vessels on location reported no further flare activity through the night.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe company had said there was minimal risk from the flare  burning nearly 500ft above sea level.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nChoc and pwoar </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nTHE founder of top choc brand <b>GU </b>is lavishing cash on lingerie. </p>\n<p>\nJames Averdieck is investing &#163;50,000 in web-based specialist <b>BLUEBELLA</b>.

Show me the five big hits at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the US charts.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, 1D have achieved something incredible with their album and the speed of their success. </p>\n<p>\nWhat makes their achievement even more jaw-dropping is that they have got this level of success in America without a huge single under their belts. </p>\n<p>\nThat is only possible now because of the power of social media. We've seen a similar thing with the film The Hunger Games. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn both cases people have heard about them through friends  so they feel like they have ownership. </p>\n<p>\nThe seeds were cleverly planted by Simon Cowell and his SYCO record label for 1D and the film company for The Hunger Games. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a gap to fill. Every generation needs its own fresh pop experience. America was ready for a boyband and they didn't have one of their own. </p>\n<p>\nNow they have fallen in love with not one but two British boybands at once. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRivals The Wanted have peaked at No2 in the singles chart in America with Glad You Came. </p>\n<p>\nBut The Wanted must be furious that One Direction timed it slightly better. Neither group could have predicted how much appetite there is for a new boyband. </p>\n<p>\nThe only other acts filling the pop void are teen, or tween, performers like Justin Bieber. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I say boyband, we are talking about the generation of boy groups who started in the Nineties. We think of Take That and Westlife as world famous but they never came close to cracking America. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNone of them had a No1 album there. So, for 1D to achieve the No1 is an incredible achievement. </p>\n<p>\nAmerica has loved many British rock groups  the Stones, Coldplay, The Kinks and The Who and, of course The Beatles. </p>\n<p>\nIt has also loved many of its own boybands, from The Monkees to 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nPreviously, the peak achievement by a British boyband was 5ive with their self-titled album in 1998  it was No27. </p>\n<p>\nThe highest position Take That ever reached was 69, although they did have one Top Ten single  Back For Good  which got to No7. Westlife peaked at 129 in the US album chart. </p>\n<p>\nEven when Robbie Williams left Take That and became a huge star across the world, he remained relatively unknown in the US. </p>\n<p>\nScreaming is nothing new now. But even in 1964 it was not new. Teen hysteria began with Frank Sinatra in the 1940s. It happens once every ten years or so. It happened with Elvis in the Fifties, then with the Osmonds, Jackson Five, David Cassidy. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey have all made good music. </p>\n<p>\nBut what they all share in common is that they satisfy the raging hormones. </p>\n<p>\nAt the moment, for whatever reason, 1D are satisfying a lot of American hormones. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nMacca: Keep your identity </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By LEIGH HOLMWOOD</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSIR Paul McCartney has warned One Direction that being compared to The Beatles is the \"kiss of death\". </p>\n<p>\nThe crazy scenes of screaming fans as 1D tour the US and Canada have been compared to the Beatlemania of 1964 when Paul, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison first hit North America. </p>\n<p>\nBut Sir Paul, 69, said the lads should be wary of any comparisons with the Fab Four as the pressure could get too much for them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he cited the example of Oasis  who were also compared to The Beatles  of what can go wrong. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It is the kiss of death. There are so many bands who all get called 'the next Beatles'. </p>\n<p>\n\"Suddenly it puts an awful lot of pressure on them to be the next Beatles. </p>\n<p>\n\"Oasis were 'the next Beatles' once. It's a pressure, because suddenly you've got to live up to all the things that we did, and it was a different time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he revealed he is a fan of One Direction  and wished the boys luck. </p>\n<p>\nHe told ITV1's Daybreak: \"Let's just call them the next terrific band.

Things can go wrong ... and they did","teaser":"DIRECTOR of the world's two biggest movies James Cameron talks to The Sun","timestamp":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 12:50:21 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nJAMES CAMERON is a man who really knows how to deal with pressure. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe has faced it all  from those who warned his 1997 film Titanic would be a &#163;125million mega-flop, to the more literal pressure of exploring the world's deepest sea bed, nearly seven miles down. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSitting next to the 57-year-old director, it is amazing to see how fresh he is after his dash to London from the remote Pacific for the world premiere of Titanic's 3D version this week. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRelaxed and unruffled, this modern-day adventurer displays a charming nonchalance when asked about the risks involved in being the first person to make a solo dive more than 35,000 feet to the bottom of the Mariana Trench to the east of the Philippines. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJames made the amazing dive in a submersible craft, the Deepsea Challenger, which was built to withstand pressures that reach 1,000 times that found at sea level. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun he says: \"There is no tow truck down there with you. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"All kinds of things could go wrong  the sub was designed for things to go wrong. A mix of electronics, salt water and pressure is pretty much a recipe for a lot of things to fail but the sub was designed for things to fail gracefully  and things did go wrong.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA couple of James's batteries lost power but he had plenty of back-up energy supplies. Only when the number of back-up systems got low did he return to the surface. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe continues: \"You just keep working around them and then you just shrug and say, 'I can't have anything more go wrong' and it is time to go back up. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"As long as your get-back system is reliable, that's the main thing. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The get-back system is the simplest thing  a heavy weight, which you drop off when you want to go back up. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"As long as that works you are OK. If that doesn't work it is going to be a very long, very cold, bad day.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt certainly would be. A military submarine cannot even descend a mile, so the chance of a rescue operation was nil. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA two-man team reached the floor of the Mariana Trench in 1960 and no one had been there since. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJames spent seven years developing his Deepsea Challenger sub and came up with its vertical design, in sharp contrast to the traditional \"horizontal\" submarine configuration. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"Myself and the co-designer of the vehicle, Ron Allum, started to sketch out the idea. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I came up with the idea of the vertical form so that we could get down to the bottom and get back as quickly as possible. There was a limit to how long I could stay in this tiny sphere. I wanted to have productive bottom time.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCanadian James  whose family moved to California when he was 17  has certainly come a long way from the days when he made a modest living as a truck driver. Even he is surprised about becoming a record-breaking director and explorer. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"I can safely say I never imagined achieving so much. As a fan of science fiction presumably there was a part of my mind that could imagine all sorts of things. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Nothing ever seemed impossible to me  I just didn't quite know how to get there and make it happen.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis fascination with deep-sea diving developed when he made Titanic. He has made 33 dives to the wreck of the famous liner, which sank on April 15, 1912. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"When I first went there it was incredibly exotic and I felt like an astronaut. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The strange thing about the Titanic is when you get there what you see is Edwardian elegance sunk two and a half miles down in pitch blackness. It is a very haunting place. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The more I dived there, the more familiar it became. By then it became like going to the office. We would get to the ship, set up, have a cup of tea.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn many ways that was the easy part of making the movie. Dealing with negative rumours before its release was tougher. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAt the time Titanic had the biggest budget of any film made and critics were predicting a huge flop. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nComparing the experience of making Titanic and his Deepsea Challenger mission, James says: \"They were pretty similar. When you are doing an expedition, a vehicle build, there is never enough time or money and you always run into deadlines. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"You get all the same stomach-gnawing issues but with a film it is just a lot more public. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"You can't make a film in secret. We built this sub in a workshop in Sydney and nobody even knew about it until we were ready to talk about it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"But you make a film like Titanic and everybody is in your knickers. They know exactly how over-budget you are. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Nobody had even seen a foot of the film, yet we were already tried and hung from the lamppost as being the biggest idiots in Hollywood history.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact Titanic turned out to be the highest-grossing box office hit in history, taking &#163;1,150million  until it was overtaken by James's sci-fi epic Avatar 12 years later. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe idea of re-releasing Titanic in 3D was formed seven years ago. James is a perfectionist who insisted on overseeing the conversion of each frame of the three-hour film into three dimensions. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt paid off, because Titanic 3D, which is released on April 6, is by far the best example of an old movie which has had the depth of three dimensions added post-production. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJames says: \"There have been re-releases in the past, which mostly didn't work. My theory on this was that 3D would be a way to redefine the concept of the re-release. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw it as a way to redefine the movie without changing a frame. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"I looked over each frame and I had my team pre-screening the work before showing it to me. The film maker should be involved.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe original film earned 11 Oscars, including a Best Director prize for James. It was a vindication for the college dropout who started in the movie industry as a model maker in the 1980s. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMany people within the business had been sceptical about him when he insisted on directing his 1984 debut film The Terminator, which he also wrote. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd he had to overcome similar misgivings when he began his underwater scientific work. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJames says: \"There was a time when people in the scientific community saw me as this Hollywood film maker and it took me a long time to develop some street cred in the science world. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"They then realised I was really serious about supporting them and understood what they were doing  not to the extent they did, but enough.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAfter making a few more dives in his Deepsea Challenger he will return to working on the script for Avatar 2. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn the far future James's explorations could take him beyond the Earth's atmosphere. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe is a member of NASA's Advisory Council, a think tank for the US space agency. And the sci-fi fan is not ruling out the idea of joining a mission to Mars. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"I would be happy to go to Mars but I don't think that is going to happen any time soon. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Even so I wouldn't rule it out. A friend of mine, Elon Musk, (a co-founder of PayPal) is building some of the most advanced rockets in the world and he fully intends to get someone to Mars at some point. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"SpaceX, it's called. He has already launched, orbited and landed safely a seven-person capsule right on target, which is no mean feat. It just didn't have anybody in it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Basically, private enterprise is taking over what used to be the role of governments. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"The Deepsea Challenger vehicle is a perfect example of that.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/james2-532_1481487a.jpg","caption":"Top director ...

We are here to turn each and every one of you into clued-up cupids. </p>\n<p>\nEvery fortnight, sex and relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr throws open the doors to her online Academy. Learning to be a good lover has never been so easy! </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight's lecture: It's time to talk...with a difference </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBBC hit programme The Voice shows how you can take away looks but the human voice is still so powerful. That power extends to phone sex with a whopping 59 per cent of the under 35s experimenting with it to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately it's easy to get wrong and embarrass yourself. Thankfully some boffins in their science labs have done lots of new research on the human voice. </p>\n<p>\nLittle did they know I can help you apply their findings to spare your blushes when you get on the blower. </p>\n<p>\nHere are my top tips for teasing talk on the telephone - </p>\n<p>\n* Sex talk is equally about what you say and how you say it so soften and lower your voice - research shows you immediately sound more attractive. </p>\n<p>\n* Slow your pace too - gabbling on is a turnoff. </p>\n<p>\n* Use a confident tone - research shows you boost each other's sexual confidence this way. </p>\n<p>\n* Avoid 'telephonus-interruptus' - ensure you won't be disturbed. </p>\n<p>\n* Set the scene - you'll feel sexier chatting relaxing on the bed with the lights dimmed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Practice makes perfect - before chatting imagine what you might say to them. Say it aloud to your self - seems daft but it works! </p>\n<p>\n* Go easy now - start gently saying something like how much you loved the last time you were in bed together...but no more detail. </p>\n<p>\n* Gauge their response - see if they start chatting 'details'. </p>\n<p>\n* Next flirt enthusiastically - compliment them, tease them, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* See how hot the banter gets especially with a new partner. Be playful hinting, e.g., \"I'd like to try something involving my dressing gown sash and being tied up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.19: Successful phone sex is as much about listening as it is about talking.</b> </p>\n<p>\nStudy checklist for turning up the heat - </p>\n<p>\n* You're now equipped to step up the dirty talk. Tread carefully with a new partner so you don't offend them. </p>\n<p>\n* Remember you might want to whisper into the phone, \"I wish you could lick me all over,\" but don't begin with something triple X-rated. </p>\n<p>\n* Give each other sexy nicknames - sharing secret nicknames strengthens your bond. </p>\n<p>\n* Throw in an occasional raunchy comment when they're phone-flirting. </p>\n<p>\n* Now begin giving lots more detail about what you're doing to yourself plus what you want to do to each other! </p>\n<p>\n* Keep in mind how far you can go - they might be happy to talk about being tied up or spanked but be turned off if you use rude words. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMake the best use of what your partner has revealed to you about their secret fantasies, e.g., maybe they've mentioned being rescued by a hunky fireman or looked after by a sexy nurse. Use this info to heighten your phone sex session. </p>\n<p>\nIf you've got lots of trust you can try sexting - sending hot pictures and messages to each other. Big Academy warning: if you don't have trust, don't do it! They could end up being forwarded to others. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many sex toys are sold in the UK each year - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 40,000 </p>\n<p>\nB) 400,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) 4 million </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer:</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is C) a staggering 4 million - get a stockbroker it's time to buy shares in batteries! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: Simon Cowell and his 'type'\n</h1>\n<p>\nIt's rumoured Simon Cowell's been hanging out with stunning makeup girl Francesca Neill. Mind you this is all completely innocent. And undoubtedly Simon Cowell is faithful to fianc&#233; Mezhgan Hussainy. </p>\n<p>\nBut he certainly likes to surround himself with his \"type\" - without fail gorgeous, immaculately groomed and glamorous brunettes. </p>\n<p>\nBeware though there can be big problems with having a romantic type. They can scupper your relationships and that's true for both men and women. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you keep trying to re-create a past relationship by seeking out a particular type, you never give the new person a chance. You try and force them into a mould. And this isn't fair on them or you in the long term. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight: The Starfish </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe needs to be flexible and he needs some strength to control this hot position as she doesn't move much. A good position for the couple where they like him to take control. </p>\n<p>\nShe lies on her back with him between her legs raised up on his hands. She brings both knees towards her chest. Depending on her flexibility she rest her feet either side his chest or on top of his shoulders. </p>\n<p>\nHe controls the action carefully and varies sensations by doing sensual circular moves with his hips, speeding up or slowing down. </p>\n<p>\nBy varying the style of his moves he can give her amazing sensations. If he moves slowly the Starfish builds their intimacy with good eye-contact. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Follow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's NEW sex-and-love guide is available to pre-order at Amazon</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>For more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>This fortnight's lecture</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>Put the science of sexual attraction to work for you</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBBC news presenter Susannah Reid's cleavage has taken on a life of its own - as reported in your Sun people are obsessed with it. That interest boils down to the science of attraction - those signals [in this case a shapely cleavage] that draw our attention. </p>\n<p>\nSometimes you haven't a clue why your eyes spring out of your head cartoon-style when you clock someone. But most of that first attraction is down to body language and other key signals we give. </p>\n<p>\nThose love-boffins found four specific brain regions light up when attracted to someone. This brain activation gives us butterflies in the stomach, feelings of euphoria, etc. -what we label Love Sickness. </p>\n<p>\nYou don't want to have to ring a doc but to stimulate a little Love Sickness in that special person here are 'his and hers' guides. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For her: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*New research shows a lower + slower tone of voice attracts his interest. You might have a complete laugh with your girlfriends but when you meet Mr. Potential slow it down, chill it out. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Give yourself as slim a waistline as possible with fashion tricks - belts, 'body cons', darker colours at the mid-line, etc. Subconsciously men are attracted to a slim waistline that signals youth and fertility. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Science shows large 'doe' eyes set high in the cheeks will attract him at a subconscious level [he can't quite put a finger on what makes you so alluring]. It's worth investing in fabulous false eyelashes. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Stand so your body forms a natural 'S' shape known to naturally attract his attention. Have one leg slightly further out making that hip dip slightly. The other hip naturally rises slightly higher = very feminine curve. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Most men get annoyed when you repeatedly flick your hair but it's the opposite with an occasional slow stroke down the side of your head - seen as sensual. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Use the age-old trick of attracting his eye-line to your cleavage with a pendant or with your fingertips as you chat. This gives him a subconscious signal a your attraction - you want him to notice your femininity. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*If things are heating up and you really fancy him slide your fingers up and down your drink glass slowly. This signals definite attraction. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*If he's unsure whether you're interested give a simple touch to his forearm when chatting to him - subtly signals your interest. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For him: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*Be a 'doer' - women are attracted to action so don't sit back being shy and quiet. When you make a move, go over, say hello, etc., you immediately score lots of points even if at first you're not her physical type. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Chat her up at the gym as research shows fresh sweat attracts women - note the key word is fresh. So straight after a class say hello don't hang around while your sweat gets stale. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*The female eye notices the classic V-shape of a man's shoulders - usually broader than the hips. So if you're not muscled up top, use the right clothing to bulk out your shoulders. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*As with vocal tone for women [above] you signal confidence with a slower deeper tone. Even if your stomach is somersaulting with nerves keep that voice calm and controlled. </p>\n<p>\n<b>* If you haven't met yet and you're standing, e.g., at a bar where she can notice you, either casually rest your hand on your hip or loop a finger through your belt loop. At a subconscious level this is a display to her of your masculinity - or your man-package. It's very primal! </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*If you're crossing a room to make contact slow your pace and try and add a little bit of swagger - don't go over the top with a big alpha male display. Subconsciously women notice the masculinity of a man's walk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Women often worry [sometimes rightly] a man's only after one thing. At a subtle level she'll notice if you start 'mirroring' her body language as you chat. This signals genuine interest rather than a shallow one - heaven forbid you'd have to shallow intentions! (Smile) </b>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>Academy Rule No.18</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nStudents should always maximise their potential - if you're looking for love you want to look your best. And if you have love you want to keep their interest. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Q: What's the average length of call to a phone-sex chat-line - is it: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>A</b>/ 10 minutes </p>\n<p>\n<b>B</b>/ 1 minute </p>\n<p>\n<b>C</b>/ 100 minutes </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A/ 10 minutes. And judging by Channel 4's My Phone Sex Secrets all types ring them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Jessica Simpson and fianc&#233; Eric Johnson </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nPregnant women look away now as Jessica's hot bedroom antics might just annoy you. Where most women as far gone as she is are content with a cuddle and a foot massage, she claims things have never been more exciting. </p>\n<p>\nJessica says she's unstoppable when it comes to sex with fianc&#233; Eric. And she's having the biggest 'big Os' ever. </p>\n<p>\nI think most pregnant women will agree it's simply TMI (too much information) and please don't give their partners any ideas! </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>Dr Pam's Position </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Ploughman </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe're not talking about cheese-based lunches here! This position requires some flexibility but is worth having a go at. She's lying comfortably on her back and he's kneeling between her legs. She draws both her legs up so her knees are bent and her heels rest towards her bottom at the sides of his hips. </p>\n<p>\nBecause he's kneeling he can pull her hips slightly higher up his thighs for good access. He controls the gentle movements to keep things steady. Couples love the sensations from this position but if he gets tired they can easily slip into classic missionary. </p>\n<p>\nFollow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's NEW sex-and-love guide is available to PRE-ORDER BY CLICKING HERE</a> </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit drpam.co.uk</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lesson: When men lose their sex drive </h1>\n<p>\nThere's this big fat sex-myth that men are always in the mood for sex. Footie team wins? Celebratory sex is on the menu. Footie team loses? It's consolatory sex to cheer him up. Best mate's birthday? Wey-hey, carry on the party at home and so on. </p>\n<p>\nBecause of this pressure men can feel completely useless when they lose sexual interest. Hey, where did it go? they wonder as they search high and low...um, nothing's happening in my boxers, nothing's happening when I wake up, or when she wears her special knickers, etc. </p>\n<p>\nOf course we women decide it must be us - we're not attractive enough anymore. He feels useless, she feels unattractive = not very good for the sex life. </p>\n<p>\nMen lose their va-va-va-voom for as many different reasons as women do - stress at work, not looking after themselves, rows between you two. But it can also be down to TDS - testosterone deficiency syndrome. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.17:</b> Students must let each other know when they're worried about not having sex. Stewing in silence is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough TDS usually strikes the over-50s it also hits many younger men especially from age 35 onwards. Not only do they lose interest in sex and find their erections aren't as powerful but they might feel they're less energetic generally and be more forgetful. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Begin by getting up the courage to speak to each other. You'll both feel so much better and mightily relieved you care enough to discuss things. </p>\n<p>\n* Check with your GP whether TDS or some other medical issue might be responsible for lack of sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep the affection and cuddles going between you. </p>\n<p>\n* Definitely have loads of fun sex-play - it doesn't have to go all the way. </p>\n<p>\n* For more TDS info visit www.sortEDin10.co.uk</a> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nWhether he's in the mood - or experiencing low sex drive  nothing's stopping you two from fun foreplay. Create a seductive \"love zone\" in your sitting room - keep one corner stuffed with cushions, candles at the ready, and your fave music in the player. </p>\n<p>\nKeep a crafty bottle of massage oil handy and give each other the Erotic 8 technique. </p>\n<p>\nTake turns lying on your backs and doing this - it gives sensual stimulation of many erogenous zones. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStart with your hands together at the breastbone and swirl outwards and under their breasts or side of his ribcage. Then bring your hands together at the point just above their navel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen swirl back outwards along their hips bringing your hands back together at their pubic bone. You can see how this makes a figure 8 shape. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRepeat swirling your hands back up their body coming in just above their navel, then outwards and back up to the top of their breastbone. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRepeat varying the pressure and speed of swirling in-and-out over their body. For extra pleasure: feels heavenly done on the back and bum if you lie on your stomach. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many women said they'd propose any time and not only leap year day - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 64% </p>\n<p>\nB) 24% </p>\n<p>\nC) 14% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 24% of women say they'd happily propose any time.

She's been doing this with big-time producer The Dream in Miami. </p>\n<p>\nMind you, you shouldn't hang out with someone who can wine-and-dine you straight after a break-up - too easy for them to sweep you off your feet, into bed, and maybe break your heart for a second time. </p>\n<p>\nBut Tulisa's timing is right and a couple of months down the line is the perfect time to go out and have fun. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Split the Whisker </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a super hot position that'll give couples more sexual confidence. </p>\n<p>\nThe man crouches on his knees as the woman lies on her back, one of her legs resting on his shoulder. Split the Whisker gives him good control because he holds her thighs, hips, or knees, in order to keep control and not slip out. </p>\n<p>\nYou can be in bed or on the floor as long as his knees are comfortable while he's crouching. </p>\n<p>\nMen love this position as it gives them a great view of her that can be a big turn on. It's also exciting for the sexually confident woman who wants to show off her body. For women to have G-spot sensitivity this zone can be pleasured if he pulls her hips slightly up his thighs. </p>\n<p>\nFollow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lesson: <br></br>Taking sex outside the bedroom </h1>\n<p>\nForget estate agents when you think of location, location, location... unless you're chatting about an estate agent fantasy. And, yes, some people might have fantasies about estate agents! </p>\n<p>\nInstead think of location as easy way to keep sex exciting. We're SO influenced by surroundings - no surprise the bedroom gets a bit ho-hum and boring. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Getting creative with locations -</b> </p>\n<p>\nAs long as you're not breaking any laws - or are very careful not to get caught - here are location suggestions. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 1:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* In the bath/shower with warm cascades of water rushing over you. </p>\n<p>\n* On the floor - any floor - but either one that's carpeted or put down a soft blanket. </p>\n<p>\n* Get carried away in the kitchen but you'll definitely need something to cushion kitchen floor tiles/countertops. </p>\n<p>\n* Working hard at your desk and want a break? Maybe you're in a hot new relationship - lean against your desk or workstation for a quickie. </p>\n<p>\n* Just in from an evening out? Why not have a quickie against the doorframe in your front hall. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 2:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* Everyone's gone home so you have the offices to yourselves. Make sure you don't get caught out by the late-night cleaner. </p>\n<p>\n* Get sex-perimental in a swimming pool - the buoyancy of the water makes things fun. Why not let the water lap around you as you go for it on a swimming pool lilo. </p>\n<p>\n* You're at a boring party - nip into the bathroom for a quickie without others knowing. </p>\n<p>\n* Gazing at the stars from a deck chair at your holiday hotel? Then try alfresco sex under the stars. Mind no one can see what you're doing - unless of course you're dogging - in which case that's a different story. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 3: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n* Time for some nail-biting adventure and get sneaky in your office during office hours. A good place is in the stationery cupboard, staff bathroom or behind your locked office door if you have the nerves for it. </p>\n<p>\n* Let's see if you can be so quiet while having sex in your garden shed while your neighbour's sitting next door in their garden haven't a clue. </p>\n<p>\n* Go for some sporting moments and do a 'Boris Becker' in the broom cupboard of a restaurant. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy warning: </b>Dubai is a popular holiday destination but never ever break indecency laws in a country like that. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.16:</b> Students should remember variety is the spice of life - that includes location. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Always have something to hand you can throw over yourselves to cover-up if someone comes by. </p>\n<p>\n* Always have a picnic blanket or at least a thick jacket to put under them for their comfort. Or to pad out any tender body part pressing against, e.g., a stone wall/tree-trunk. Naughty you if you haven't thought of your partner's comfort! </p>\n<p>\n* Pleasure each other with your hands or through oral sex when outdoors. It heightens your sense of risk. </p>\n<p>\n* Simply start your foreplay when out and about - save finishing each other off at home can lead to exhilarating sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Once spring is here use sun cream for any under-exposed body area that may see the light of day  like your bum! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\n'Take 10' to think about your local area and dream up a new location to suggest. When cuddling up tell describe how that beauty spot you go for walks in would be the perfect place to grab some sneaky sex - or at least some fun foreplay. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The equation:</b> Always having sex in bed = using the same position time-after-time. Take things out of the bedroom and you're likely to try new positions too. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How much will the rich and famous spend on a platinum covered, diamond encrusted vibrator? </p>\n<p>\nA) &#163;2,000 </p>\n<p>\nB) &#163;200 </p>\n<p>\nC) &#163;20,000 </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - talk about more money than sense - you can get this dazzling number courtesy of Jimmyjane.com.

They need time, love and attention or they don't survive. </p>\n<p>\nDown the line expect an album of happy, fulfilled love songs... may not be what connected to her fans to her in the first place! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Dr Pam's Position of the Fortnight </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Monkey</b> </p>\n<p>\nThis position is for the experienced couple - requires fitness and flexibility but there is double benefit as it works for both vaginal and anal penetration. </p>\n<p>\nHe lies on his back at the edge of the bed and bends his knees to his chest. She gently sits back on to his erection. She rests her arms slightly behind her so that he can hold them.

But if either goes queasy at the thought, there's plenty to discuss before slipping into a sex club armed with little more than a nervous grin and condoms. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule:</b> Must I tell you no one should be pressured into a three- or moresome if they're not into it? Exactly! Discussion is one thing, pressure is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nCouples who discuss fantasies to spice-up sex usually delve into the arena of three-ways. </p>\n<p>\nBut fantasies are SO different to reality. It's hard enough grappling with two sets of sexual needs plus the more embarrassing side of sex like sweaty bodies and surprising sounds. </p>\n<p>\nFactor in a third set of these things and suddenly keeping it only to fantasy-chat is appealing. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise if determined to go for it: </p>\n<p>\n* You both must really, really want to try it. </p>\n<p>\n* Agree how to go about it, e.g., do you want to look through contact mags or go to a local swinging party or fetish club to find a third-party. </p>\n<p>\n* Sex clubs all have their own rules so check these out. </p>\n<p>\n* Agreeing ground rules is a must. Some couples put certain sexual behaviour off limits like giving or receiving oral sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Accept either - or both - might experience jealousy if feeling threatened in any way by the third party. That includes thinking the third party is more attractive, better in bed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Excellent communication between you is crucial to avoid jealousy/insecurity. </p>\n<p>\n* Discuss whether you'll have the same third party involved in regular sex sessions or always look for new partners. Some couples prefer seeing the same third party. Others worry some sort of love triangle might form threatening their relationship. </p>\n<p>\n* Be prepared that after trying this one of you might go off the idea. </p>\n<p>\n* Get all MI6 about it and \"debrief\" after each experience to see how you're both feeling. </p>\n<p>\n* Crucial to abide by ground rules like NO outside contact - like phone calls - with any new sex partners. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nSpend time discussing each other's motives for wanting a threesome. Some are positive - you're both sexually confident and experimental. Others negative - you need a confidence boost or to combat bedroom boredom. </p>\n<p>\nNegative things need serious consideration because adding a third person is likely to complicate these. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nBefore going for it, get in bed and try to fully imagine having a third person in there with you. Spelling out the details to each other might make you more cautious. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Desire to try it + complete confidence between you = worth a shot! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How much cool cash did Michelle Obama reportedly spend this week in Agent Provocateur's New York emporium? </p>\n<p>\nA) &#163;320 </p>\n<p>\nB) &#163;32,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) &#163;3,200 </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge Answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - that's a heckuva lot of oh-oh-heaven for President Obama. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Heidi Klum and Seal</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nYep, this super-gorgeous couple are separated but Seal said in an interview this week he still loves Heidi. </p>\n<p>\nWhere there's love, there's a way to sort things out. With three children between them plus a fourth from another relationship of Heidi's they shouldn't give up on love too soon. </p>\n<p>\nRumours have been rife about why a couple that always looked love-struck on the red carpet would split. </p>\n<p>\nNone of these alleged reasons are insurmountable, even the ones about Seal having a bad temper. </p>\n<p>\nAnger management, couples counselling, both sticking in there, whatever it takes is worth it before these kids' lives are torn apart for good. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Spinner</b> </p>\n<p>\nHe lies flat on the bed/floor and she sits astride him facing him. She then spins carefully around so she ends up facing his feet. </p>\n<p>\nThis position allows her to vary the pressure of penetration by varying the way she sits. </p>\n<p>\nLeaning forward, her hands on his ankles, decreases pressure. Leaning back, resting her hands at the side of his stomach, increases pressure. </p>\n<p>\nHe can hold her hips to maintain penetration so she doesn't slip off. Slipping her feet underneath her (with knees bent), while supporting herself with her hands, she can then raise and lower herself. </p>\n<p>\nThis variation is known as 'offering the moon' because of the way her bottom moves up and down (mooning) in full view of him.

So if he or she is always pestering you for sex - and you just don't have the interest - you've got a lot of company. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not really surprising - after all when you got together he preferred pizza and she preferred Chinese. He loved an action holiday and she loved lying on the beach. So why wouldn't your sex drives be different too? </p>\n<p>\nBut there's double-trouble when this happens. The partner who has a higher drive feels neglected. And the partner who has a lower drive feels pestered or inadequate. </p>\n<p>\nThese issues have a way of creeping into the rest of your relationship even when you know you love your partner. Time to tackle the differences between your drives. </p>\n<p>\nThe first step is to stop any finger-pointing. Playing the blame game will get you nowhere. Being honest, loving and tactful is the only way to go. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.14: Students should remember there is no right or wrong to how high or low your sex drive is as long as you're both working towards a compromise.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\nHere are some [not all, mind you] of the main culprits affecting sex drive - see how many might apply to you or your partner. </p>\n<p>\n* lifestyle issues like out-of-control stress and long working hours </p>\n<p>\n* personal choices like excessive drinking, and 'recreational' drug use </p>\n<p>\n* being overweight leading to less sexual energy </p>\n<p>\n* experiencing depression and anxiety </p>\n<p>\n* relationship difficulties or breakdown, rows, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* certain physical problems like having a bad back are draining </p>\n<p>\n* fatigue after childbirth can kill sexual desire </p>\n<p>\n* surprising things affect sex drive including medications like the birth control pill, anti-depressants and blood pressure medications </p>\n<p>\n* hormonal changes later in life for both men and women </p>\n<p>\n* other passion killers include worries over financial problems </p>\n<p>\n* and to be brutally honest... plain old boredom in the bedroom can lead to lack of sex drive </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\nPut aside 10 minutes this weekend to study this list and work out if these - or any other things - are affecting your sex drive or your partner's. </p>\n<p>\nIf you identify a culprit or two what can you do about these? The first step is to share this info with your partner - a positive \"we can fix this together\" attitude has been proven to help. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're overly stressed at work  it's killed your sex drive leaving your partner high and dry. Obviously deal with the stresses - take on fewer responsibilities, talk to your manager about streamlining your work load, etc. </p>\n<p>\nBut when you feel up to a fun solution play a sex-game where you pretend to be someone completely different - someone without a care in the world. </p>\n<p>\nGive yourself 'permission' to let go and have fun. Tell your partner you're shutting out worries and focusing on some sexy pleasure. Spin this into a hot fantasy where you're the boss in your dream job - and you're interviewing them to work for you. The main interview 'test'? You have your way with them! </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: being honest about issues + actually sorting them = increased sex drive! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people admit to dumping a lover by text - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 30 per cent </p>\n<p>\nB) 10 per cent </p>\n<p>\nC) 70 per cent </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nA survey out this week reveals the correct answer is B) - 10 per cent say they've dumped a lover by text - how cowardly! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Peaches Geldof and Thomas Cohen</b> </p>\n<p>\nPeaches has always lived life in the fast lane and it's revving up to full throttle now she's expecting her first baby and planning her second marriage at 22 to musician Thomas. </p>\n<p>\nI can only hope this marriage gives her the stability she needs because she'll need to provide her baby with stability. It doesn't happen in reverse - babies aren't there to make you feel better about yourself or to give your life meaning. </p>\n<p>\nThankfully there's the optimism-of-youth on her side that she can conquer all the hurdles coming her way.

Try my tips, tricks and techniques to sexy satisfaction: </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 1: How To Find Out What They Desire</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMany are too shy to say what they like. If your partner's shy take their finger and gently suck and kiss it - then ask if those sensations feel good. Put that info to good use for kissing and sucking their different erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nAlso say something like, \"Do you prefer it when I stroke or squeeze you here?\" It gives them the confidence to be honest. </p>\n<p>\nDefo tell them it's exciting when they tell you what to do to them. Make it playful where they must \"command\" you by saying Yes or No if you're touching the right spot - and in the right way. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 2: Any Activity Can Be Sexy</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTurn practically any activity together into sexy fun and give each other little sensual pleasures. Offer to wash their hair - gently and sensually caress their scalp as the warm water rushes over it...heaven! </p>\n<p>\nOr do something surprising like paint her fingernails. Take each of her fingers gently and show just how sensual your touch can be as you paint each nail. </p>\n<p>\nNever miss a trick when sharing supper to get a little bit rude with food. It's incredibly hot to hand feed each other. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 3: Quickie Tricks</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDevise your favourite 'quickie tricks' that press both of your buttons. For instance he might have one perfect way of touching her that turns her right on. She should let him know what it is because that's the technique to use when you've only got a little time. </p>\n<p>\nWhy doesn't he try 'twirling the pearl' for a quick turn-on? Using his thumb and index finger he gently twirls back and forth around her clitoral region. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 4: Have a laugh</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nToo many couples take sex too seriously - they forget to laugh with (not at!) each other even when things go wrong. </p>\n<p>\nTry fun things like spontaneously deciding to jump into a shower together. Enjoy the water rushing over you, lather each other up, and even invest in a waterproof sex toy. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got ice cubes in a drink have a giggle and slip one down each other's tops - then roll around in bed trying to get it off your skin - and back onto theirs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 5: Kinky-lite</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTry 'Kinky-lite' techniques like playing a little game of At Your Mercy - one of you is blindfolded while the other is allowed to touch, kiss, and lick all over. You don't know which area's going to be touched next! </p>\n<p>\nOr agree to have your wrists tied together with something soft and silky like a dressing gown sash - have some fantasy chat about being at your partner's mercy.

Or they get stuck just moving a vibrator back and forth - a bit snooze-inducing. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sex Toy Etiquette:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nNever introduce a sex toy by whipping a big, shiny, pulsating one out, waving it around and expecting your partner to be instantly aroused. Instead try these ploys \n</p>\n<p>\n*If unsure of their reaction be subtle - suggest popping into your local adult shop and gently steer them to the vibrators. </p>\n<p>\n*Start toying with said toys and look quizzical - as if you're wondering whether they'd be fun or not. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask if they've ever thought about what playing with a vibrator would be like. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep it light and flirty to give them confidence to take a good look at the toys. </p>\n<p>\n*Never grab the biggest vibrator (and crikey there are some huge ones on the market) particularly if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep sex toys as an added extra to your sex-play so your partner doesn't feel redundant. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Good Vibrations:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAlways use lashings of lubricant for a lovely smooth glide across any erogenous zone. </p>\n<p>\nRemember he might be just as keen as she is to feel a vibrator running up and down his chest, abdomen, between the thighs, over the perineum and anal area. </p>\n<p>\nProblem is many men don't want to appear anything but 'straight' - so she should suggest it. </p>\n<p>\nOr after he's used a vibrator on her erogenous zones she can tease him with it. Sometimes it takes her confidence that it's okay for him to enjoy vibrating pleasure for him to relax and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>\nFor added pleasure during penetrative sex slip the vibrator between you two. They come in all sorts of shapes/sizes so invest in a range for different uses - a slimmer one will slip between the two of you easier. </p>\n<p>\nJust in case it's got a powerful vibration, first run it across their abdomen so they can get used to the feel of it. Then you can ask if she's ready for it to be run across her breasts or he's ready to have it run between his thighs. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she's turned on, gently run it back and forth across her pubic mound. Rather than using the end of the vibrator to touch her skin, lay it 'flat' along her pubic bone and move it back and forth covering a bigger area with the vibrations. Guaranteed to drive her crazy! </p>\n<p>\nIt's definitely worth investing in a fingertip vibrator. Slip onto your forefinger and reach all sorts of tiny and exciting places that a normal-sized vibrator can't. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.12:</b> Students shouldn't use a vibrator for more than 20 minutes on one area as you can over-stimulate that area. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Hygiene is crucial so, e.g., if you use an anal vibrator it shouldn't then be used on her vagina. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep separate sex toys for each other. </p>\n<p>\n* Clean your sex toys as per the instructions. </p>\n<p>\n* Before you use a new sex toy get used to the way it works - some are complicated. </p>\n<p>\n* Never ever use everyday items as makeshift sex toys! </p>\n<p>\n* As well as pleasuring each other use for self-pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n* When using lubricants choose water-based ones that won't break down the surface of your plastic-based toys. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you've never tried a 'tongue joy' vibrator get one for oral pleasure! </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nThis neat little vibrator slips onto your tongue so that during oral sex not only does your partner feel the warmth and moistness of your lips and tongue but also the fabulous little vibrations from this sex toy. So practice putting it on your tongue when you're alone and imagine gently flicking it around their most sensitive areas. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: a little vibrator + tongue-action = super hot climaxes! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: With so much talk about 'cougars'(older women) - what about older men?

It's hard enough for a 17-year-old to have a relationship with someone of the same age - let alone someone 15 years older. Add to this the intense national scrutiny and I can only see it ending in tears. </p>\n<p>\nThere's nothing wrong with an age gap relationship on the whole - but they work far better if both people have at least reached their 20s. Otherwise there's a risk the older partner takes over and controls everything. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Sexy Santa [normally called The Staging Post] </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI specially renamed this red hot position The Sexy Santa for Christmas.

So a man might say he has a 'fetish' for large breasts but lo-and-behold his partner has small ones. And a woman might say she has a 'fetish' for men in gym gear but she doesn't turn into a raving nympho the minute a man strolls into her aerobics class. </p>\n<p>\nWhere do fetishes come from? Sometimes the development of a fetish is very complex but other fetishes are easily understood. Take the teenage boy pleasuring himself as he stands at his bedroom window. He catches sight of the neighbour doing some gardening in her Wellington boots and hey, presto, Wellington boots forever hold a special meaning. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a fetish checklist every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Always ask your partner to describe exactly what they mean by 'fetish'. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Check out if they can only be turned on with their fetish or if it's simply a preference. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Have fun considering compromises. For instance, if he has a fetish for women in PVC it might work for her to slip into a PVC basque OR miniskirt. She doesn't have to dress head-to-toe in it yet he'll love the fact she's wearing one PVC piece. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>See if fantasy chat about the fetish will satisfy that partner's desire. You could potentially chat up a storm about him worshiping your feet - instead of him actually licking and sucking your toes if that turns you right off [think Fergie all those years ago]. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Some fetishes might seem downright comical - like a fetish for pink, fluffy slippers or footie strips. But resist having a laugh at your partner if they're willing to trust you and open up. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>If either of you are troubled by their fetish consider sex therapy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule: Be honest if a fetish turns you off.</b> If a fetish like splodging [having a 'good' time hurling cream cakes, etc., or rolling around in puds] makes you laugh it can spoil the moment for the partner that takes their splodging seriously. </p>\n<p>\nDitto if your partner has what you think is a disgusting fetish involving something like 'scat play' [let's not even go there!] put your foot down fast. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> Think through how you can enjoy your partner's fetish. Let's say they've a fetish for gloves. Buy a pair and surprise them during foreplay by whisking them on. </p>\n<p>\nFor their added pleasure select the texture your partner prefers - soft and velvety, smooth and silky, firm and leathery. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy sex trick:</b> as you'll be left- or right-handed - and probably use that hand in foreplay - try swapping over. Use the hand you don't normally use to caress them giving a new sensation. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A fun attitude + fun fetishes = fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of people have a foot fetish according to fetish research - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 1.1% </p>\n<p>\nB) 11% </p>\n<p>\nC) 21% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - just over 1% of people reportedly have a foot fetish. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Jennifer Lopez and Casper Smart </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nJ-Lo, 42, has revealed her credentials as a top-class cougar by getting with tattooed toyboy dancer Casper Smart, 24.

Madonna plays by a simple rule: these are fun, sexy relationships that both parties can enjoy... but they're not permanent! </p>\n<p>\nDemi Moore on the other hand has found out the tough way most younger men don't stick around for a happy-ever-after.

Once in position she simply lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p>\nTo vary the sexy sensations she can move her leg further up his hip - or close it down more tightly around his knees. By wrapping her leg around his knees and pulling his legs more into hers it adds lots of good friction between them - great if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\nSextra Academy tip: Allow your hands to wander over each other's backs and bums.

Evidently a whopping 33% of single girls sleep with their male friends. </p>\n<p>\nSuch friendship fringe benefits put a smile on many faces. But handled badly friends can fall-out over their best mate booty-calls. </p>\n<p>\nHere are definite 'dos and don'ts' for your friendship that strays into full-sex territory: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Friends often flirt with each other - which is why many question whether men and women can really 'just be friends'. So take it cautiously if there's been flirting between you and secretly you'd like things to end up in bed. They may not feel the same! </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> It's likely the first time you two slept together it was under the influence of too many drinks...the classic starting point for so many friends with fringe benefits. So have a chat the morning after to make sure you're both feeling okay about it. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Never humiliate your friend by telling your other pals what you two got up to. Keeping it between your selves avoids loads of gossip or other friends sticking their oar in. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Even if you two have occasionally gone all-the-way no friend should feel pressured to always say Yes to a booty call. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Don't be surprised when your friendly fringe benefits end because one of you finds a proper boyfriend or girlfriend. No room for jealousy - after all you were only friends that took it further. </p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No.9: Always be honest with a friend you're sleeping with. If you know they're falling in love with you - and you don't feel the same - set them straight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSince you've already got trust between you why not get up to some hot sex-perimentation you wouldn't normally try? Go on, they're a friend so don't be slow in coming forward. Ask if there's something they've always wanted to do. </p>\n<p>\nThis is the perfect time to share something like a steamy shower where you sensually lather each other up. Then you can take turns satisfying each other with oral pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Tip:</b> Take a cushion into the shower to kneel on when you're giving oral sex (mind you, a cushion you don't mind getting soaked). </p>\n<p>\nAs the water cascades down you'll both love the sensations of having oral fun under a shower. Have two big warm towels ready to dry each other off with. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nNow you know loads more about each other's likes and dislikes having got playful in the shower. Take that knowledge into the bedroom for more sex-ploration. Why not ask them to keep still while you gently run a sex toy up and down their body to give them lovely sensations. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: friends + fringe benefits = having fun (if you both know where you stand)! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Test Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people who have flings-with-friends are hoping for a relationship too? </p>\n<p>\nA) 8% </p>\n<p>\nB) 38% </p>\n<p>\nC) 68% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - 8% of people who sleep with a friend say they're also hoping for romance. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Loved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Sarah Harding and Tom Crane </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nStunning Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding looks like she's sorting out her personal problems as well as her broken engagement with DJ Tom Crane.

They care more about a guy's personality - plus his sex-techniques that'll satisfy every time. </p>\n<p>\nBut try telling that to a 'smaller' man - it takes loads of encouragement for them to believe it. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The Size Statistics:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrossing the Channel there are 'size stats' from French research out this week. The beret-clad boffins found the average erect penis is between 12.8 - 14.5 cm [5 - 5.7 inches]. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's smaller than this it doesn't mean he can't 'live it large' in the bedroom with many top tips below. </p>\n<p>\nFirst a quick question: Are you a \"grower\" or \"shower\"? Many smaller men when flaccid [non-erect] actually grow 100 per cent when erect. Many larger men when flaccid are likely to grow by only 75 per cent when erect. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.8:</b> No Academy student should ever ridicule a man's size - such remarks can scar him for life. If a woman ridicules your size she's not worth your time. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* The Americans have a saying \"a diamond's better than a brick\" - so a 'smaller' man should always be confident about giving pleasure in other ways. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Remember that some [not all] well-endowed men have no sexual finesse in bed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* It's crucial a man sees himself as a complete man - not just a man with a certain-sized penis. He's far more than his penis size! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Confidence is highly attractive. So the smaller man that's confident generally - and about his sex techniques - will satisfy his partner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* The average length of a woman's vagina when aroused is about 10 cm [4 inches]. So it doesn't take as much length to satisfy her as men think. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* So-called Small Penis Syndrome - or 'locker room syndrome' - is more common in men of average size. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Despite the 'averages' there's huge variation amongst men. The famous Masters and Johnson's research team measured hundreds of penises - the longest non-erect one was 5.5 inches long. The shortest was just over 2 inches long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* A 'smaller' man should aim to be the \"King of foreplay\" to thrill his partner. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework [and this applies to any couple not just a man on the smaller side!]: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBecome the King of Foreplay by confidently asking her what she'd like you to do. As you kiss ask what kind of touch she'd like on her breasts, etc. </p>\n<p>\nLearn to use your fingertips wisely  vary between gentle strokes, circular movements, swishing back and forth, and gentle pinches. Keep asking what feels best. </p>\n<p>\nDitto your tongue and lips - try licking, flicking, sucking and circular movements with your tongue. </p>\n<p>\nCompletely spoil her by kissing, licking and touching all over her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe can encourage him to become the King of foreplay: if you feel shy asking for what you want when cuddling take his hands and move them to your fave erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nKeeping your hand on top of his, gently move it back and forth over these showing the type of touch you like. </p>\n<p>\nTake his finger between your lips and suck it the way you'd like him to apply pressure to your fave zones like your nipples. </p>\n<p>\nYou'll really turn him on if you get the courage up to whisper detailed instructions of what feels best as you get nearer to climax. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Foreplay techniques + confidence = a great lover! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of women report being happy/satisfied with their partner's penis size - </p>\n<p>\nA) 5% </p>\n<p>\nB) 85% </p>\n<p>\nC) 25% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 85 per cent of women are perfectly satisfied by their partner's size. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>George Clooney and Stacy Keibler </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe big question on Tinseltown's lips is whether gorgeous George Clooney has met his match in stunning wrestler Stacy Keibler. </p>\n<p>\nThe statuesque blonde would be wise to treat it like a wrestling match - going in with a game plan if she wants to beat his reputed phobia of commitment. </p>\n<p>\nIf you're with a man that's shy of committing let your confident independent side shine through.

This sends the \"Yawn Factor\" in the bedroom sky high. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhy do couples do this? Like most things in their relationship their sex position simply becomes a habit. For instance, it's Friday night and he's on his way home - he thinks to himself, \"Ah, it's sex night, that means a couple brews and Spoons position before bedtime.\" Mind you, she's probably thinking the same. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNothing wrong with 'comfortable' sex in a long-term relationship - but without occasional changes it's a passion killer. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Inwardly many partners feel shy about suggesting a new position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Or they don't want to upset their partner by suggesting a new one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Couples don't realise it's fairly easy to move into another position from their tried-and-tested one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*If they don't like a new position they can go back to the old one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*It's okay to take time after being in one position to pause for more foreplay - it might lead into trying a second position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No. 7: You don't have to stay in one position from the start of a sex-session to the finish. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nYour Hot Homework: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Try one of the following suggestions:</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n1/ Let's begin with a simple sex-periment - begin in classic Missionary position  he lies on top of her. Then he shifts his weight off of her, moving onto his side and facing her. This frees her to move onto her side but with her back to him. As easy as that you're now in Spoons position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n2/ Try The Cradle position  she's on top, lying chest-against-chest with him. She draws her legs up underneath her so her knees are bent. It's called the Cradle because it's as if she's now cradling him with her body. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis is perfect for slow and sensual moving and allows you two lots of touching and kissing. Some women may need to reach under and cradle his bottom to steady them if his thrusting intensifies. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n3/ Or experiment with the Lovers' Embrace position. You can easily move into this from The Cradle [above] - you both gently ease sideways. Or from Spoons - she simply turns around to face him. Or move into it from Missionary. All you do is lie on your sides facing each other, embracing. She lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy spice-it-up tip: To vary sensations she moves her leg further up or closes it back down more tightly on his leg. This varies the pressure you both feel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFirst reassure your partner you enjoy what you do together - but that you want to tempt them into </p>\n<p>\none of these new positions.

Most people have a few quirks or kinks they secretly wonder about. Often these aren't mentioned until they build trust with their partner. Obviously they don't want to be laughed at or to shock their partner. </p>\n<p>\nAs far as I'm concerned - as long it is legal - what you as consenting adults discuss trying is your business. </p>\n<p>\nThe most common kinky things partners ask to try include: Being blindfolded, a bit of spanking, tying up, and dressing in role-play outfits. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 6</b>: Students should never feel pressured to go beyond the 'kink-level' they feel happy with! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\nIf your partner raises kinky sex-play (or you want to raise it with them) try these: </p>\n<p>\n*Be clear exactly what's meant. The word \"bondage\" might be mentioned and all they mean is getting fur-lined handcuffs from the high street adult shop. They don't mean sticking you in a dungeon! </p>\n<p>\n*Because some partners will panic at words like \"bondage\" think carefully how you describe the thing you want to try... so take the fright-factor out. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll boost your confidence if you stick to some fantasy-chat first. It's fun and sexy and you can sound out how far you two might want to go. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll make you both feel secure reassuring each other this is \"special occasion sex\". You're not going to have to 'swing from chandeliers' every time you have sex. </p>\n<p>\n*If you do anything like handcuffing each other remember it's no joke to leave someone handcuffed (or tied up). Just don't do it! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's take the handcuffs scenario - invest in some from an adult shop. Or spare your blushes and order them online. Then experiment on each other. </p>\n<p>\nYou can tease the person who's handcuffed by kissing them all over and even \"tormenting\" them with an ice cube held between your lips. Trace a cold line over their erogenous zones only to be warmed up with a trail of lovely warm kisses afterwards. </p>\n<p>\nOr while they're \"captive\" turn it into a hot fantasy where you're taking them away to be kept as your sexy prisoner. Have fun with banter along these lines - or any other scenario that you two conjure up. </p>\n<p>\nHeighten the teasing by using their favourite sex toy on them while they're handcuffed.

But people still lack confidence about getting dressed up in sexy gear - particularly some of the fetish gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's understandable, no one wants to look foolish, but you shouldn't underestimate the visual impact of wearing sexy things. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips for sizzling in sexy gear: </p>\n<p>\n* When you're with someone new don't slip into something super-kinky - they might feel a bit intimidated. </p>\n<p>\n* Add in sexy gear one step at a time. </p>\n<p>\n* Suggest shopping together to get the balance right - choose anything from sexy-lite to full-on-fetish. </p>\n<p>\n* If you're going to surprise your partner with a hot new outfit think about the things they mention in their fantasies. Do they talk about thigh-high, black patent lace-up boots or little floral dresses? Let those things guide your choices. </p>\n<p>\n* Beware of overdoing it. Sexy stilettos and a short skirt might look amazing. But if you also wear a lace-up basque it might be OTT - you can have too much of a good thing! </p>\n<p>\n* You can get lots of cheap n' cheerful gear or one 'investment' piece, e.g., a gorgeous hand-made basque. Is your partner going to want to have fun ripping it off - like in a bodice-ripping fantasy? Maybe go for the cheap n' cheerful stuff! </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought something sexy to wear - practice flaunting yourself in it on your own. That helps banish feelings that you look silly. Gradually you'll think, Hmmm, I look pretty hot! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 5:</b> Students should never embarrass a partner who's attempted to dress-up for them. You could 'scar' them permanently by telling them they look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Nearly 10% of people say it'd turn them on if their partner dressed up in a uniform. Playing 'doctors and nurses' has never been so much fun now you can pick up these outfits from adult shops. </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought an outfit have some fun with a little bit of role-play. </p>\n<p>\n* If you both enjoy sexy dressing-up occasionally go to costume hire shops for some adventurous ideas. </p>\n<p>\n* There is loads of fun gear for men - he might end up strutting around the bedroom in a black leather, studded man's thong. </p>\n<p>\n* If, as a woman, you're not happy about your legs stilettos and high-heeled boots lengthen them - and make you feel super sexy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe next time you two are 'in the mood' let your partner know you'd like to try a bit of dressing up. Start gently saying something like \"I've fantasised about you wearing old-fashioned stockings and suspenders.\" </p>\n<p>\nThis doesn't feel threatening to them and can plant the beginning of some great ideas. Have fun with it and ask her/him what they think of this - and if they've ever wanted to wear kinky gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet creative with things you already have that could work well as sexy gear. Pair some very high heels with little frilly knickers - strut around in front of him with you both pretending he's caught you out getting dressed. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: imagination + sexy gear = red hot love! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percent of people say they get turned on by spanking - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA/ 15% </p>\n<p>\nB/ 75% </p>\n<p>\nC/ 5% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A/ - 15% of people say they like to include spanking in their sex play. That's potentially a lot of sore bottoms! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nIt's not surprising Amanda Holden always looks radiant after announcing recently she and husband Chris Hughes are expecting a baby. After the devastation of losing their baby son earlier this year they now face a brighter future. </p>\n<p>\nThe fallout from a tragedy breaks up some couples. But those who keep talking and supporting each other - as Amanda and Chris obviously did - can come out the other side fighting and with a stronger relationship. </p>\n<p>\nIf you two are facing a crisis, face it together and support each other. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Courtesan</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a sophisticated position that she can pair-up with some new sexy gear she's bought - like a short miniskirt minus her knickers. </p>\n<p>\nShe sits on a lowish chair or at the end of the bed. He kneels in front of her - on the floor - facing her. Their hips need to be at the same height for full sex. </p>\n<p>\nAs they kiss and cuddle she lifts her legs carefully and wraps them around his lower back. She pulls him in towards her and edges on to the end of the bed or chair. </p>\n<p>\nHe studies her by holding her around her waist. Once they're in position and comfortable he can begin gentle thrusting. </p>\n<p>\nThey may not last long in this position - as she needs quite a bit of strength to keep her legs wrapped around him - but it's an excellent one for them to continue kissing and caressing. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons Week 4: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Body-image issues that stop you enjoying sex</b> </p>\n<p>\nIn extensive body-image research I found staggering numbers of women insist on lights-off during sex with their fella - over 40 per cent. Heaven knows how many single women - who don't have the trust of a long-term relationship - turn out the lights too! </p>\n<p>\nWhen it came to weight issues the stats were worse - a massive 75 per cent felt overweight. Sadly women think men will heads for the hills at the glimpse of a bulge. </p>\n<p>\nBut it doesn't stop there as now the fellas have body-image issues too. So the Academy aims to banish body hang-ups  men's and women's - from the bedroom. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips to boost body confidence - </p>\n<p>\n* Daily remind yourself you're more than what your body looks like - focus on your top personality traits - e.g. you're funny, kind, caring, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Take charge of negative thoughts about your body. Tell yourself nobody's perfect, no one cares about lumps and bumps, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Face reality: do you want to waste time wishing you had a smaller bum or bigger breasts OR get smart and put your energies into enjoying life - including your sex life? </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Choose your sexiest attribute - maybe your naughty smile or cheeky glint in your eye etc. Value these special lovely little things - and flash that smile. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Buy things that accentuate your good attributes. Be proud to flaunt those - whether it's your breasts, bottom, legs, shoulders etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* If you genuinely have excess weight do something FUN to get fit, e.g., take some sensual Latin American dance classes. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 4:</b> Each day students should close their eyes for a few moments and visualise themselves as a Sex Goddess or Sex God. Hang onto this hot and sexy image for the rest of the day! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Most people simply don't notice what you think are your bad points. </p>\n<p>\n* Research shows sexiness comes from confidence - walk tall, with good posture, pretending to be confident - you'll soon believe it. </p>\n<p>\n* You're not the only one with body issues - that person in bed with you probably feels the same inside. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDevise your own super-hot 'signature sex technique' - take a sexy thing you already do well and make it even hotter. This helps you lose inhibitions - and worries about your body - since you'll feel confident doing your signature technique. </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're fab at kissing and also pretty good at giving oral sex. Why not devise your very own oral technique that uses your snogging skills? </p>\n<p>\nFor instance if you're great at French kissing apply those techniques 'down below'. You'll have your partner gasping for more - all they'll notice is how great you make them feel. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your technique + extra effort = your signature sex technique! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people feel too embarrassed to talk about sex - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 91% </p>\n<p>\nB) 31% </p>\n<p>\nC) 1% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is B) - a large survey found 31% of people are too embarrassed to talk about sex even with a partner. If you don't talk to each other you won't get what you want! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Loved-up Celebs </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nHollywood hunk Will Smith and wife Jade Pinkett Smith have denied break-up rumours. A couple who always present a united front the splitting-up stories were surprising. </p>\n<p>\nThe strong theme of their love? Definitely the way they keep their family unit tight - forming Team-Smith with children Jaden and Willow. This is the perfect way to handle their stratospheric celebrity status with all its temptations. </p>\n<p>\nCouples should take a page out of their book and protect their love by creating some 'team spirit' between them. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Spoons </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a great position for anyone overcoming body confidence issues because neither of you gets a good look at each other's bodies. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of you lie on your sides, the man behind, the curve of her back and bottom snuggled into the curve of his stomach and chest. She parts her legs for full sex. </p>\n<p>\nBy alternating how high she lifts her top leg it varies the friction they feel. He can carry on with foreplay with his arms wrapped around her - easy to run his hands over her erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nThe Spoons is versatile and ideal for a slow, sensual or more vigorous sex.

And only about 15 per cent climax regularly. Those statistics equal a whole load of disappointment! But we can change this today. </p>\n<p>\nHere are some pointers every good student should learn - the first section is for the girls (but the guys should take a peak): </p>\n<p>\n* Reject thoughts that you'll \"never climax\" - it's easy to slip into a negative mindset when you've never climaxed with a man. </p>\n<p>\n*Even if you're with a partner where it's never happened, tell yourself \"I'm going to start afresh and be positive - it can happen if I relax about it!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n*Women should know how their body works. The best way forward is letting your fingers do the walking through self-pleasure. Men are masters of this - high time women became the mistresses of their bodies too. </p>\n<p>\n*Self-pleasure arms you with knowledge you then share with a partner. </p>\n<p>\n*Relax in a warm bath, the shower, or in bed with the lights down low. Maybe light a candle, put on some mood music and explore your body. </p>\n<p>\n*Share the sensations you discover with him the next time you're together. </p>\n<p>\nAnd for the guys: </p>\n<p>\n*Sorry guys, you may think you're Mr. Lover-man but what you think works may not work for her! </p>\n<p>\n* Help her relax and tell her to take her time. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask her what you can do to help bring her along. </p>\n<p>\n*She might feel embarrassed because it takes time to climax but reassurance will go a long way. </p>\n<p>\n*Really listen to her suggestions - hopefully she knows what works for her - she just needs to share it. </p>\n<p>\n*Don't get stressed-out if it takes some time getting to know what works for her. Treat it as sex-perimentation! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 3:</b> Students shouldn't fake orgasms - it seems okay when you don't want to \"hurt his feelings\" because you're tired and it's just not going to happen. But in the long run honesty's best. There's nothing wrong with enjoying sex-play knowing you're too tired for it to end in a climax. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet started with lashings of foreplay for her. Take your time showering her with kisses. Definitely kiss around the back of her neck and ears - unless she's supersensitive this is oh-oh-heavenly. </p>\n<p>\nStroke her lightly with your fingers - you build more sexual tension swirling them gently all over her body. Build to a firmer touch checking that she wants it. </p>\n<p>\nPretend you're her \"sex doctor\" discovering what makes her \"feel better\". Turning exploring her body into foreplay. Keep asking her what feels good and where. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you're both ready for full sex let her select the position - all students should check out my recommendation below. Give her \"permission\" to take charge of the action. Remember you can always have your pleasure once she has hers! </p>\n<p>\nThe must-know equation: understanding your body + sharing that knowledge = climax guaranteed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: By the time a couple's been together two years how much less sex do they have then when they first met? Is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 10% less sex </p>\n<p>\nB) 90% less sex </p>\n<p>\nC) 50% less sex </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is C) - they have half as much sex as when they were in the hot honeymoon phase! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSometimes a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do in the name of love! </p>\n<p>\nThe Hoff's girlfriend Hayden Roberts quit her job behind Debenham's makeup counter because bosses wouldn't give her enough time off to spend with David. It must've been makeup brushes at dawn as she stood up for her love. </p>\n<p>\nIn this case she's got her priorities right because sometimes love has to come first. I hear from too many women with bitter regrets having put their careers first. </p>\n<p>\nYou've got to look at the circumstances and sometimes they're so unique you need to make tough decisions. </p>\n<p>\nHow many Hollywood hunks - even the ageing ones - is Haley going to meet? And heck the Hoff looks like fun now he's cleaned up his act! </p>\n<p>\nIf things ever go pear-shaped and Haley doesn't get her happy-ever-after with the Hoff she's smart enough to know that there are other make-up counters and department stores - and men - out there. Food for thought if you find yourself weighing up the pros and cons of whether someone's worth making sacrifices for. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The CAT</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe Coital Alignment Technique (or Clitoral Alignment Technique as some call it) is the perfect choice this week  it's simple yet almost guaranteed to give her a climax. </p>\n<p>\nShe can either be on top or the bottom - but if she has difficulty climaxing I recommend she goes on top. He lies flat on the bed, her on top - sort of a \"reversed\" missionary position. She can have her legs inside his or outside of his. </p>\n<p>\nHaving them inside his legs squeezes his penis [edit, manhood?] fairly tightly so she should be careful how much pressure she uses. She then shimmies a couple centimetres up his pelvis so that her pubic bone rubs against his pubic bone. </p>\n<p>\nHe can reach around her hips and hold her in place - for a little added pleasure he can squeeze her buttocks gently. She controls the action using small circular or rocking movements. </p>\n<p>\nThe CAT allows her full control of the sensations she gets. It also slows him down so he doesn't climax too quickly allowing her to get the right stimulation to climax. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's a bit lazy he can have a rest while she goes on top and takes over! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>.

A whopping 94 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women confess to them... the rest are fibbing saying they don't have them. </p>\n<p>\nSo today's lesson is all about fantasy-chat to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nTiming's crucial - if your partner's just confessed undying love it's not the best time to mention your kinky bondage fantasy. But in the middle of fun foreplay? Definitely ask if they have \"naughty thoughts\" about secret desires. Using words like \"naughty thoughts\" is gentler than diving-in asking about fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nUse what you're already doing to kickstart fantasy-chat. If you're gently rubbing massage oil on them describe lying on a tropical beach and they're a sexy stranger who comes over to flirt. They begin rubbing suntan oil into you - you end up slipping off for amazing sex. Hopefully such chat will get your partner in the mood for sharing their fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nVariety's the spice of life - don't always describe the same scenario as that can get boring. The whole point of fantasy-sharing is roaming into fresh territory. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 2:</b> Students shouldn't upset a partner by describing fantasies of sex with their fave celeb or a hot fantasy about your neighbour! No, no, a 1000 times no - it's very bad bedroom manners. Your partner should feature prominently in your fantasies - at least the ones you share with them. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise. </p>\n<p>\nA healthy fantasy life has benefits: </p>\n<p>\n* It helps you escape sexual boredom </p>\n<p>\n* You get double the pleasure - you share your secret fantasies and they share theirs </p>\n<p>\n* When your partner's away fantasy-chat makes phone-sex more fun </p>\n<p>\n* In your private fantasies you can be with anyone - even people you'll never meet like your favourite celeb </p>\n<p>\n* Sharing fantasies gives you two fresh ideas to try - like some role-play </p>\n<p>\n* It's free! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge  when feeling confident to share your fantasy, describe one that boosts your partner's sexual confidence. </p>\n<p>\nToday's homework is to dream one up ahead of time - then when you're next in bed together whisper, e.g., \"You're so gorgeous I fantasise I'm a photographer and you're a model. I chat you up and start undressing you.\" This type of fantasy makes them feel fab - and that's the point. </p>\n<p>\nOne of you is probably more confident so by all means \"go first\" describing your fantasy. But emphasise you really want to hear theirs. Turn it into a game where you have to guess their fantasy. This can reveal all sorts of juicy stuff to chat about. </p>\n<p>\nAnother great game is taking turns deciding the next twist in a fantasy scenario. E.g. you start by describing how you get lost and go into a bar to ask directions. </p>\n<p>\nNo prize for guessing there's a really sexy stranger (who looks like your partner - remember your manners!) sitting at the bar who starts chatting you up. Now your partner says what happens next, and so on. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your fantasies + their fantasies = endless fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many under-30s have had sex with a friend - in other words \"friends with fringe benefits\"- is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 66 % </p>\n<p>\nB) 6 % </p>\n<p>\nC) 36 % </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A) - one study found a whopping two thirds of under-30s has been more-than-friendly with a friend!

Inside you get a bit paranoid thinking: \"Am I a sex maniac, wanting too much?\" Or \"Don't they fancy me anymore?\" </p>\n<p>\nWomen are particularly bad about blaming themselves when he loses interest. Whereas the fellas are less worried about blame - they just want to sort out more sex! </p>\n<p>\nAcademy rule No. 1: Don't point the finger of blame for lack of sex at yourself or your partner. You're in this together, you'll sort it together. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist of passion-killing culprits every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n* Problems in your relationship (at each other's throats and you won't be at it!) </p>\n<p>\n* Trouble at work/financial worries </p>\n<p>\n* Not enough sleep or time together (a good chance the Beckham's are experiencing this one) </p>\n<p>\n* Too many late nights including too much booze and cigs </p>\n<p>\n* Boredom with the same old sex and/or feeling shy about trying new things </p>\n<p>\n* Medical problems and/or side-effects of prescription medication </p>\n<p>\n* Stress, anxiety and/or depression (face it, when you're down you don't feel sexy) </p>\n<p>\n* Erectile difficulties for the man meaning he avoids sex </p>\n<p>\nMost of these affect the way you feel and think i.e. your brain action. Research shows how powerfully our brains affect sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\nPut a hot, naked woman in front of a depressed man and his brain won't switch on his arousal centre. What hope has his wife of five, ten, or more, years got? </p>\n<h3>\nHot &amp; Helpful Homework: </h3>\n<p>\nIt's time for applying your new knowledge - thoroughly examine the checklist and get stuck in with the main culprit. If a number of these are affecting your sex life, focus on changing one at a time. </p>\n<p>\nStudy example: Let's say you're having lots of arguments plus partying too much at weekends - ending up hungover. </p>\n<p>\nWhen calm, agree with each other that the arguing must stop. Then look at what starts arguments (Household chores? Money?) and work out solutions together. </p>\n<p>\nBe the first to be affectionate and loving to your partner despite the rows. Making these efforts will have big payoffs. </p>\n<p>\nThinking of our example - arguments and partying  next knock excess drinking on the head. A hangover on a Sunday morning doesn't lead to Sunday afternoon delight! Agree a drinks limit and help each other stick to it. </p>\n<p>\nWhen things are better, recharge the spark. Make regular time for each other, get cosy on the settee, and whisper in their ear how much you miss that \"thing\" they do best in bed. </p>\n<p>\nTease them a little, let your fingertips gently run over their erogenous zones, and keep up the sexy banter. Full sex should be back on the agenda soon. But consult your GP about ongoing health issues that might affect desire. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many couples now regularly use oral sex to guarantee the woman's satisfaction - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 45% </p>\n<p>\nB) 20% </p>\n<p>\nC) 69% </p>\n<p>\nA: The correct answer is B.

herself together all through the illness. Some people give up, but she always thought she was going to beat it. </p>\n<p>\n\"Jemma may have had cancer, but cancer never had Jemma. Everyone was in awe for what she did and how she handled the cancer.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJemma, of Exeter, Devon, first displayed symptoms in 2008 and started what was to be four years of chemotherapy in February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nShe worked with Alex at EDF Energy in Exeter and they became an item just nine months before her death. </p>\n<p>\nHeartbroken Alex said he had no idea she had cancer when they first got together. </p>\n<p>\nHe explained: \"I didn't know she was ill, you wouldn't. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was just a normal relationship as you could imagine to start with, but then two months in the cancer spread to her liver and her lungs and I knew then that I had to be there for her. </p>\n<p>\n\"But I loved her  it was as simple as that, so it was never really a decision.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlex proposed in January and the wedding was set for April 18 at Colehayes Park, a Grade II listed Georgian mansion in Dartmoor National Park. </p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Forward</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut on March 16 the couple decided to bring the date forward to the following day because Jemma's health was deteriorating. </p>\n<p>\nThey arranged for a special licence for a registrar to come to the family home and conduct the ceremony at 4.30pm on March 17. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jemma died at 3pm with Alex and her family at her bedside. </p>\n<p>\nMum Janet said her daughter worked hard to raise the profile of the Eve Appeal, which raises money for research into women's cancer. </p>\n<p>\nJanet also told how Jemma also tackled the Great West Run, Birmingham Half Marathon, and even took part in the Race for Life the weekend after she had undergone chemotherapy. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"She was inspirational  she carried on as if there was going to be every tomorrow. </p>\n<p>\n\"She was completely wiped out after the Race for Life but she was determined to do it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe added: \"She touched everyone she came in contact with and she lived life to the full and never gave up. </p>\n<p>\n\"She was determined to get across the message to younger women about the dangers of ovarian cancer, which they call the silent killer. </p>\n<p>\n\"We cared for her at home but it wasn't really care because she did it herself, she was very independent.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDad Bob added: \"She was absolutely unique. </p>\n<p>\n\"The week she died I helped her do her bedroom  she was always looking forward and never back. </p>\n<p>\n\"She never once let her dress drop, she never once let her make up drop, she never let her hair go silly, she never felt sorry for herself and always thought of other people before herself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"At her funeral there was about four times the church outside and inside, they had to do it by a loudspeaker.\"\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Inspiration</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJemma had proven an inspiration to many women and her campaign for the Eve Appeal gynaecological cancer research charity was widely praised. </p>\n<p>\nThe charity said she had helped get the message to thousands of women. </p>\n<p>\nLiz Engel, of the Eve Appeal, said: \"I first came into contact with Jemma in 2009 when she wrote to me about her illness and was concerned that most of the people she knew were not aware of the risks or symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. </p>\n<p>\n\"Despite living with the worry and uncertainty of her diagnosis she was unwavering in her determination to help us to reach others, and particularly younger women like herself. </p>\n<p>\n\"There must have been days when she just didn't feel like it but whenever we asked her she would cheerfully agree.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJemma's funeral was on Tuesday, March 27. </p>\n<p>\nShe was treated for ovarian cancer after her diagnosis in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nJemma first noticed something was wrong in 2008.

Many sufferers can be bedridden for years. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition where you suffer widespread pain and fatigue. </p>\n<p>\nAs many as one in 25 people may suffer from it in Britain. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Here, LYNSEY HAYWOOD speaks to three people who tell us why these two illnesses are far more serious than most people realise. </i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSophie, 17 </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SOPHIE ELLIS has suffered from ME since she was nine. She can't even watch TV or send a text and is fed through a tube. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She has not been downstairs in her house in Banbury, Oxon, for more than a year. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She lives with dad Mark Ellis, 52, a financial adviser, and mum Karen, 52, her full-time carer. Mark says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Sophie was nine she got a fairly typical virus which lasted two to three weeks. </p>\n<p>\nBut she never really recovered. </p>\n<p>\nShe suffered crippling gastric problems, heartburn and acid reflux, as well as a general lack of energy. </p>\n<p>\nThe GPs we saw tried to deal with the symptoms rather than the root cause. </p>\n<p>\nAs parents we had no knowledge of ME, so while seeing countless consultants we never thought to ask about it. </p>\n<p>\nWe simply thought it was something people got in the Eighties and it made you feel like you had flu. </p>\n<p>\nWe certainly didn't know you could treat it. </p>\n<p>\nSophie was getting worse and worse to the point where she couldn't eat and was increasingly bedbound. </p>\n<p>\nThen, about two years ago, one consultant suggested ME and, after researching it ourselves, it all made sense. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt took up to six years to get an accurate diagnosis but sadly, by then, having pushed herself so hard for six years, Sophie's batteries were completely run down. </p>\n<p>\nIt felt like we'd missed our window of opportunity when we could have done something. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Karen has given up her job as a shelf-stacker at Sainsbury's to be her full-time carer. </p>\n<p>\nThe slightest thing exhausts Sophie and because it's neurological, it affects every part of her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe can't watch TV or use a laptop because she's light intolerant. It makes her dizzy or ill. </p>\n<p>\nShe can't read more than a couple of times a day and she hasn't been downstairs for more than a year. </p>\n<p>\nWe can't speak to her for more than a few minutes at a time because it drains her energy. </p>\n<p>\nHer room has to be dark and she needs help getting to the loo as she's too wobbly on her feet. </p>\n<p>\nShe can read texts but can't type herself because her brain can't co-ordinate her fingers. </p>\n<p>\nEating and chewing is now almost impossible for her, so she has a tube which feeds liquidised food through her nose, but she can drink herself. </p>\n<p>\nWe're trying to step up the little achievements she can manage each day  exposing her to a little more light, getting her to eat a little food herself. </p>\n<p>\nBut if we push her too hard she relapses badly and we're back at square one. </p>\n<p>\nWe can't have visitors to the house at all now because of any potential disruption. The best Karen and I can hope for in terms of our own lives is a walk and a coffee when Sophie's brother Matt, who is 29, comes round. </p>\n<p>\nThis makes Sophie feel terribly guilty too  ME impacts hugely on everyone. </p>\n<p>\nBut throughout Sophie's been bright and cheerful, always with a smile on her face. </p>\n<p>\nMeeting other people through the Association of Young People with ME (AYME) has helped us realise we're not alone and often people do get better We've met people in their twenties who are leading largely normal, happy lives, who were once like Sophie is now. </p>\n<p>\nThey are our inspiration to keep going. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nJamie, 23 </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>JAMIE STRONG, from Kingston upon Thames, is determined to end the stigma surrounding ME. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nFive years ago I regularly lapped the eight miles or so around Richmond Park on my bike. As a healthy, active 17-year-old, I enjoyed hanging out with my mates, running and pumping iron at the gym. </p>\n<p>\nThen in January 2007 my whole world came crashing down. </p>\n<p>\nOut of the blue I started having severe stomach pain with bleeding. </p>\n<p>\nI was diagnosed with probable gastroenteritis and, after a colonoscopy, ulcerative colitis. </p>\n<p>\nI started to get joint pain and brain fog. </p>\n<p>\nI struggled through my A-levels but by September I was having trouble standing. </p>\n<p>\nI was collapsing all over the place and had to postpone my place at university. </p>\n<p>\nNext I was diagnosed with Addison's disease, which is a lack of pituitary hormones in the body. </p>\n<p>\nI was given more medication, which helped me go off to the University of East Anglia, but my short-term memory was letting me down and I felt exhausted. </p>\n<p>\nSix weeks after I started, my parents had to come and take me home. It was then that I received the diagnosis of ME. </p>\n<p>\nME is sometimes called chronic fatigue syndrome. But fatigue doesn't come close to what I have. </p>\n<p>\nMost mornings I wake up  if I manage to sleep at all  feeling more drained than when I went to bed. </p>\n<p>\nI often experience near-paralysis in my legs. If I manage to get myself in the bath, I then have to lie on the bath mat for 20 minutes before I can stand up. </p>\n<p>\nGoing up the stairs feels like I'm climbing Everest. </p>\n<p>\nEven reading or a conversation can be too much for me now. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I try to keep going, the exhaustion can become so extreme that I feel as if I'm about to die. It's like my brain is on fire. </p>\n<p>\nI have burning muscle pain and painkillers bring little relief. When this happens, the only way to survive is to lie in a dark, silent room. </p>\n<p>\nI desperately miss friends my own age. They no longer see me since they don't understand why I can do so little or why the doctors can't help me. </p>\n<p>\nI've made contact with other young people with ME but mostly they are too ill to meet. I can leave the house once or twice a week if someone is taking me and I don't have to walk far. Sometimes I use a wheelchair. </p>\n<p>\nI've tried everything to get my health back  alternative therapies, acupuncture, diet, supplements, cognitive behavioural therapy, increasing activity levels, relaxation techniques, meditation, resting, pacing and medication. </p>\n<p>\nTo live this life with no end in sight feels like a living death. </p>\n<p>\nIf only people would realise this is a real, devastating physical illness, then those with ME wouldn't feel so abandoned, dismissed and belittled. </p>\n<p>\nWe need the Government to treat this as the serious illness it is, to educate doctors and to instigate more research so that proper treatments  possibly a cure  can be found. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nLinda, 52 </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>OCCUPATIONAL therapist Linda Horncastle was crippled by pain caused by fibromyalgia for nearly two decades. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She even contemplated suicide to spare her family the burden of looking after her. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda, from Seer Green, Bucks, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI first fell ill aged 27, after the birth of my son Matthew. I saw a specialist who said it was a trapped nerve and gave me pain-killers, but it didn't get any better. </p>\n<p>\nThe pain spread across to my other shoulder, down my back and I felt so utterly tired all the time. </p>\n<p>\nFour years after Matthew was born I had my second son, Steven, by which time I couldn't lift either of them up. </p>\n<p>\nIf they wanted a hug, they'd have to climb on to my knees. </p>\n<p>\nI was completely dependent on my husband David, now 52, and friends to help me with the kids. I finally found out what was wrong with me when I was 33. </p>\n<p>\nWe were living in France and a GP referred me to a rheumatologist who said I had fibromyalgia. </p>\n<p>\nHe advised I visit some thermal baths and make changes to my diet. But then David's job was transferred back to the UK and the stress of moving made my symptoms worse. </p>\n<p>\nI was housebound for days on end. I didn't have the energy to do the school run and I was in constant, agonising pain. </p>\n<p>\nMy family was suffering so much because of me. </p>\n<p>\nDavid had to do all the cooking and housework. Normal things such as family holidays and after-school clubs weren't an option for Matthew and Steven. </p>\n<p>\nI felt so guilty I twice contemplated suicide, thinking they'd all be better off without me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd lost almost all my friends because I couldn't leave the house. I had panic attacks whenever I went on public transport. </p>\n<p>\nThe turning point was reading an article by a physiotherapist who'd been similarly debilitated by fibromyalgia. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained how she had got her life back and even started work again with stretching exercises combined with cutting out sugar, caffeine and gluten from her diet. </p>\n<p>\nI made all these changes and went to a pain clinic where I learnt relaxation techniques so I didn't burn myself out. </p>\n<p>\nMy symptoms improved by around 40 per cent, but I was still far from well again. A doctor suggested I try a device called an Alpha-Stim. </p>\n<p>\nThis uses a small electrical current to produce alpha waves which stop my brain getting more pain signals than it should. </p>\n<p>\nBy the end of the second week of using it I was feeling much better. I slept well for the first time in decades and my energy and pain levels improved. </p>\n<p>\nI even started work again in 2010, which I never in a million years thought would happen. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>For more information see ukfibromyalgia.com</a> and meassociation.org.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/3869083/Is-your-tiredness-down-to-thyroid.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Is your tiredness down to thyroid?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4017963/France-advises-women-to-get-risky-breast-implants-removed.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"France advises women to get risky breast implants removed"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01479/SOPHIEM-532_1479882a.jpg","caption":"Once so vibrant ...

It's incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n\"<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I'd try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n\"For breakfast, I'd have four slices of toast. For lunch I'd make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n\"Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I'd never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n\"Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: \"I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn't dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n\"So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges  you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n\"Worth more than &#163;3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class  purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n\"So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I'd done. It was the motivation I needed to carry on,\" she says. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Comparing myself month by month stunned me. My face was thinner and I could notice the difference in my waistline and arms.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I began looking forward to each month when the time came to take a picture and compare myself to the previous one.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola also joined women-only gym Curves and began working out twice a week. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"After the first year I'd lost five stone  down from 24st to 19st. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My meals changed completely to consist of a piece of toast for breakfast, a sandwich with two pieces of brown bread for lunch, fruit for a snack and meat with vegetables for dinner. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking at myself filled me with pride and the compliments I was receiving from friends and family were incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was determined this wasn't going to just be a fad diet phase  this was a new lifestyle for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the next three years she lost a further six stone, dropping to 13st 2lb. </p>\n<p>\nNicola says: \"Every woman wants to look their best in a photo. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I was ever tempted to have a take-away binge at the end of the month, I'd think about having my picture taken and it would put me off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd for shoe-mad Nicola there was only one way to mark her sensational new figure. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In January this year I splashed out on a beautiful pair of &#163;380 cream Jimmy Choo shoes to celebrate.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4210484/Ive-tried-61-different-diets-since-I-was-13.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"I've tried 61 different diets since I was 13"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Why we're all tee totally happy"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4201637/My-8-year-takeaway-binge-cost-25kand-my-unborn-babys-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My 8-year takeaway binge cost £25k...and my unborn baby's life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I'm proud to be UK average size 16.

Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

Try <b>Origins Never A Dull Moment</b> skin-brightening polisher with fruit extracts to help reveal a healthy glow, &#163;24 <i>(Origins)</i>. </p>\n<p>\nPut your feet up and slather on <b>Elemis Papaya Enzyme Peel</b>, &#163;28.60 <i>(Elemis counters)</i>.

You can layer under make-up or wear stand-alone. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are going out and want to appear more made up, try adding highlighter along the cheekbones, down the bridge of the nose and on the forehead  this gives a shimmering dewiness. </p>\n<p>\nYou can also place highlighter on the brow bone and under the arch of the brow to make your eyes appear brighter. </p>\n<p>\n<b>L'Oreal Lumi Magique Concealer</b>, &#163;8.49, <i>(Boots)</i> will help to brighten the eyes if you dab a small amount in the darkest areas, ie, underneath, and <b>Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer</b> in Chestnut, &#163;17, is great for darker skins.

My mum was from Norway, my dad from Switzerland and my grandmother was Finnish, I have an Italian uncle, my first love was from South Africa and I was born in Texas.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am definitely a Texan girl. It is a culture you really love in a Latin sort of way. You taste it and hear it and the climate is hot  Texas hot.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI felt lucky that my parents were European  different  and opened the doors to let me see America is not the centre of the universe. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant that, with Bridget Jones, I could go to London and enjoy all things English that make the country so wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the making of the first film, I was even whistling songs by the Spice Girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my mum was a realist about bringing up a teenage girl in America and kept a sense of humour. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me that there are consequences for the things you say and do. She wanted me to grow up to be a good person. She and Dad liked simple and quiet. We had a very quiet house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mum didn't talk about her childhood growing up in Norway during the Second World War. Her sisters talked but all had difficulty in putting into words what they had seen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey told about women giving birth in tunnels because there was no safe haven in any other structure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd about being lost from family members and not being sure if they were alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it was different for me, from my friends, growing up in a house where your mother was grateful just to have peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was one thing which was never acceptable, though.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I said: \"I don't know how to do that\", she would say: \"Learn.\" </p>\n<p>\nShe encouraged me to get a college education (Renee has an English degree) as something to fall back on if acting didn't work out.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved to Los Angeles on December 6, 1993, to be exact.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy attitude was that I was going to see where it took me.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been working in Texas from the age of 21, and been in a couple of films. But I had pretty well exhausted my learning opportunities. </p>\n<p>\nSo I took a grungy little one-bed apartment and was scared to death of the future. It was a leap of faith, I guess. </p>\n<p>\nI had some friends in LA who I had met on films but inside and emotionally, I felt alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make a living, I worked in a bar called The Three Cubs on a street called Vine, behind the Mobil gas station.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was an incredible place for a girl like me, who had lived in relatively safe places all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were crack deals being done on the street corners  so I would come back from the bar late at night then not be able to get out of my car to my apartment until the deals were completed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked at the bar for two years. That was why Mum's guidance was so important and I stayed happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you can take care of yourself and see your friends, that is all that matters. </p>\n<p>\nThe main difference that the film Jerry Maguire made in my life was I could pay my rent and didn't have to waitress any more. It gave me freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew from the start that if I failed in acting, I always had my degree and could try a million things. I was not a \"look at me\" kind of girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had gravitated toward acting because I had a vivid imagination and daydreamed a lot. </p>\n<p>\nBut I did not daydream about being on a film set, winning an Oscar or having people know my name.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for the fact my mum never worried that I would compromise myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was always telling me, 'You don't sit down enough'  but she learned to trust my instincts.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/3927676/Jerry-Maguire-actors-grown-up-to-be-a-big-star.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jerry Maguire actor's grown up to be a big star"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01473/Renee_Zellweger--5_1473337a.jpg","caption":"Different perspective ...

3","teaser":"ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV levelled late for City  but their title hopes were still dented","timestamp":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 13:22:12 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nALEKSANDAR KOLAROV capped a dramatic comeback for Manchester City with a late equaliser against Sunderland. </p>\n<p>\nBut the Black Cats, through Seb Larsson's double, still seriously dented the title aspirations of Roberto Mancini's men at the Etihad Stadium. </p>\n<p>\nThe Swedish midfielder netted the opener on 31 minutes, only for Mario Balotelli to level two minutes before the break with a disputed penalty. </p>\n<p>\nMartin O'Neill's side were in no mood to go into half time behind however, with a Nicklas Bendtner planting home a header. </p>\n<p>\nDanish frontman Bendtner then turned provider 10 minutes into the second period, allowing Larsson to open up a two-goal lead. </p>\n<p>\nA cracking goal from Balotelli on 85 minutes gave City hope of clawing something back, with Kolarov duly delivering for the home side moments later. </p>\n<p>\nBut the result still leaves City sitting two points behind rivals Manchester United  who now have the chance to extend that lead to five with victory at Blackburn on Monday night. </p>\n<p>\nCity had welcomed back influential captain Vincent Kompany after four games out, while Sunderland were forced to leave out on-loan left-back Wayne Bridge against his parent club. </p>\n<p>\nThe visitors were lively early on and had a good chance to go ahead after 15 minutes with Sessegnon twice involved in a sweeping move  only for Craig Gardnerto hit the side netting. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCity responded with Dzeko testing Mignolet and Kompany, back in the side after a calf injury, scuffed a shot wide from the resulting corner. </p>\n<p>\nRichards won a corner which Balotelli headed over and City began to show signs of frustration. </p>\n<p>\nGardner found McClean on the edge of the area with a smart reverse pass and the Irishman turned to fire narrowly wide. </p>\n<p>\nBendtner then had a shot blocked before the Black Cats grabbed a deserved lead just after the half-hour. </p>\n<p>\nLarsson did the damage with a superb finish after Sessegnon found space on the left and picked out the Swede inside the D. </p>\n<p>\nThe Swede had defenders blocking his sight but had enough room to flick a low shot with the inside of his boot beyond Joe Hart's reach into the bottom corner. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nCity tried to respond quickly and Yaya Toure was angered when he was dragged back by Kilgallon as he raced towards the area. </p>\n<p>\nMignolet saved the resulting free-kick from Kolarov and follow-up efforts from Milner and Richards were blocked. </p>\n<p>\nBalotelli wanted a penalty after going down in the area. </p>\n<p>\nReferee Phil Dowd waved play on but did point to the spot moments later after Dzeko jumped into a challenge with Gardner. </p>\n<p>\nSunderland were furious at the decision but Balotelli kept his cool to level with a clever spot-kick. </p>\n<p>\nAn argument broke out between Dzeko and Phil Bardsley when play was stopped following a clash of heads between Richards and Jack Colback. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBalotelli proved an unlikely peacemaker and play eventually restarted. </p>\n<p>\nCity may have wished it had not as Sunderland reclaimed the lead in first-half injury time when Bendtner planted a firm header past Hart from a Sessegnon cross. </p>\n<p>\nCity boss Mancini made an attacking change at the start of the second half by sending on winger Adam Johnson for Richards and dropping Milner back to right-back. </p>\n<p>\nYaya Toure needed treatment and continued to look uncomfortable after being caught by Lee Cattermole in midfield. </p>\n<p>\nThe City talisman was then beaten to the ball inside his own half as Sessegnon launched the attack which led to Sunderland's third. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBendtner raced into space down the right and played a low ball into the box for Larsson, who timed his run perfectly to slide in at the far post. </p>\n<p>\nMancini's response was to send on Tevez for Silva and the hosts spurned a chance moments later as Kolo Toure headed over from a corner. </p>\n<p>\nCity won a free-kick after Kolarov went down on the edge of the area and frustrations boiled over as the hosts could not decide who should take it. </p>\n<p>\nBalotelli clearly wanted to be involved and reacted unhappily when Tevez lined up behind the ball. </p>\n<p>\nKompany had to push the Italian away and in the end it was Kolarov who took it, curling a shot wide. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTevez had his first chance as City broke from deep but hit the side netting from the edge of the area. </p>\n<p>\nBendtner missed a fine chance to make it 4-1 when he fired over from the edge of the box and City finally stirred into life. </p>\n<p>\nBalotelli reduced the arrears with a fine goal, all of his own making, five minutes from time as he came in from the left and ran across the edge of the box to beat Mignolet from distance. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hosts threw everything into attack and were rewarded again as substitute David Pizarro rolled the ball wide for Kolarov to smash home. </p>\n<p>\nDespite some frantic late scenes, however, City could not claim a winner. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Man City:</b> Hart, Richards (Johnson 46), Toure, Kompany, Kolarov, Milner

2 Arsenal 1","teaser":"ADEL TAARABT and Samba Diakite did the damage as Gunners' win streak ended","timestamp":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 13:25:29 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nBATTLING QPR ended Arsenal's winning run  and boosted their survival hopes. </p>\n<p>\nThe R's earned a hard-fought 2-1 victory to climb level on 28 points with Blackburn. </p>\n<p>\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Adel Taarabt fired the hosts into the lead on 22 minutes with his first Premier League goal. </p>\n<p>\nArsenal levelled through Theo Walcott 15 minutes later, but Rangers snatched what could prove a priceless three points through Samba Diakite mid-way through the second half. </p>\n<p>\nQPR captain Joey Barton had used his pre-match programme notes to call for the Rs fans to get behind him after being booed off the pitch while being substituted during the win over Liverpool 10 days ago. </p>\n<p>\nBut the controversial midfielder received a mixed reception when his name was read out ahead of kick off. </p>\n<p>\nWalcott made early progress down the right channel, forcing a corner which was eventually hacked clear. </p>\n<p>\nArsenal continued to press without stretching the home side. </p>\n<p>\nOn seven minutes, Clint Hill bundled Walcott over to concede a free-kick just right of centre, 25 yards out. </p>\n<p>\nRobin van Persie struck a low, curled effort goalwards, which Paddy Kenny gathered at the second attempt, with Walcott looking to pounce on the loose ball. </p>\n<p>\nRangers were soon on the offensive, with Alex Song needing to make a couple of important blocks as Bobby Zamora threatened. </p>\n<p>\nThe home side continued to push Arsenal back, and Zamora sent a free header over from 10 yards after a deep free-kick into the area. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut QPR broke the deadlock on 22 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nTaarabt collected a pass from the halfway line, before turning Thomas Vermaelen on the edge of the penalty area and dispatching the ball into the bottom corner. </p>\n<p>\nMoroccan Taarabt celebrated by donning a fez that he then threw into the crowd, but referee Mike Dean took a dim view of his actions and brandished a yellow card. </p>\n<p>\nArsenal needed to regroup, but had been in this situation more than once recently and recovered to secure victory. </p>\n<p>\nBut QPR remained full of energy, with Taarabt enjoying plenty of the ball. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nArsenal were level on 37 minutes with their first real chance. </p>\n<p>\nVan Persie made space on the edge of the area and stabbed the ball to Walcott. </p>\n<p>\nThe England winger cracked a first-time effort off the base of the far post, and was quickest to the rebound, hooking in his seventh Premier League goal of the season. </p>\n<p>\nArsenal began to pass the ball around with confidence, Aaron Ramsey dragging a low shot from 20 yards across goal and wide. </p>\n<p>\nThe visitors pressed again at the start of the second half, as Bacary Sagna floated over a deep cross from the right which fellow full-back Kieran Gibbs nodded just wide. </p>\n<p>\nQPR were now finding it difficult to retain much possession, and then gave the ball away when looking to build a break. </p>\n<p>\nOn 57 minutes, Kenny punched away an angled free-kick from Van Persie. </p>\n<p>\nThe Dutchman was denied again by the QPR keeper after spinning off his marker and racing into the penalty area. </p>\n<p>\nQPR then went ahead for the second time on 66 minutes. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nVermaelen slipped again, allowing Jamie Mackie to skip into the penalty and pulled the ball back for Diakite to slam home. </p>\n<p>\nArsenal needed another response and on 69 minutes, Gervinho replaced Ramsey. </p>\n<p>\nQPR soaked up plenty of pressure, but also looked dangerous on the break as Arsenal committed men forwards. </p>\n<p>\nWith 10 minutes left, Mikel Arteta was replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Marouane Chamakh came on for Gibbs. </p>\n<p>\nBarton almost sealed it when his effort was tipped over by Wojciech Szczesny after another break by Mackie down the right. </p>\n<p>\nThe late Arsenal fightback never materialised as Rangers closed out four minutes of stoppage time to boost their hopes of staying up. </p>\n<p>\n<b>VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS AVAILABLE FROM

And the visitors were ahead after just nine minutes. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSturridge crashed home from close range after a pinball scramble following Salomon Kalou's cross. </p>\n<p>\nIt was nearly 2-0 when John Obi Mikel's thunderbolt hit Collins  and deflected straight to Shay Given. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the Blues then went even closer when Juan Mata hit the post and Torres saw his follow-up blocked. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nVilla started to regroup but Barry Bannan's curling free-kick was dealt with by Michael Essien. </p>\n<p>\nFrank Lampard then deflected a Warnock cross just wide before Nathan Baker volleyed over from the resulting corner. </p>\n<p>\nPetr Cech's sensational 43rd-minute save stopped Villa levelling before the break. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWeimann played the ball to Agbonlahor, who spun sharply 10 yards out before firing in a powerful low drive. </p>\n<p>\nBut Cech somehow managed to deflect the shot over the bar. </p>\n<p>\nFormer Villa defender Gary Cahill replaced Luiz, who had suffered a knock, on the stroke of half-time. </p>\n<p>\nSix minutes after the break, Chelsea doubled their lead. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTorres attacked a Mata corner and brushed the ball to Ivanovic, who turned in past Given. </p>\n<p>\nDi Matteo's men looked in complete command and seemed to be cruising to three points. </p>\n<p>\nBut on 77 minutes, Collins gave Villa a glimmer of hope when he nodded home Lichaj's throw-in. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAn amazing comeback was on the cards  and Lichaj sent Villa Park wild by converting Marc Albrighton's corner just three minutes later. </p>\n<p>\nIncredibly, the drama did not end there. </p>\n<p>\nIvanovic smashed home on 83 minutes in a carbon copy on his first.

Damien Duff ensured Cottagers' goalless run ended in style at Craven Cottage","timestamp":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 13:19:46 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nCLINT DEMPSEY and Damien Duff fired the goals that saw Fulham take down Norwich at Craven Cottage. </p>\n<p>\nMartin Jol's side went into the game on the back of three without a goal  but arrested that slump with Dempsey's opener in the second minute. </p>\n<p>\nDuff then doubled Fulham's advantage in the 13th, although an impressive first half showing was tempered by Pavel Pogrebnyak limping off injured. </p>\n<p>\nSubstitute Aaron Wilbraham's 77th minute effort led to a nervy ending by the Cottagers, who held onto end a three-match losing streak. </p>\n<p>\nFulham captain Danny Murphy had started along with forward Bryan Ruiz, as boss Jol shuffled his pack slightly. </p>\n<p>\nNorwich handed a debut to January signing Ryan Bennett as manager Paul Lambert made four alterations to the side that defeated Wolves last weekend. </p>\n<p>\nAny fears that Fulham's struggles in front of goal would continue against the Canaries were extinguished after just 107 seconds. </p>\n<p>\nRuiz latched onto a long ball, turned and saw a low drive saved by goalkeeper John Ruddy  with Dempsey bundling the ball home. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNorwich then enjoyed a spell of possession, but went further behind in the 13th minute. </p>\n<p>\nAgain the Canaries were caught out by a quick surge forward as Dempsey slotted the ball through to Duff, who curled home a left-footed effort from the edge of the box. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMousa Dembele had a shot deflected as Fulham pushed for a third, before Dempsey twice saw headers go awry. </p>\n<p>\nElliott Ward picked up the game's first booking for a challenge on Ruiz in the midst of the Cottagers' dominance. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd there were calls from the home faithful for the centre-back's sending off after he was adjudged to have taken down Pogrebnyak minutes later. </p>\n<p>\nThe Russia international picked up a knock in the clash and was replaced in the 35th minute by debutant Alex Kacaniklic. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile struggling to control the match, Norwich were still looking dangerous in flashes and Jonny Howson wasted a gilt-edged chance to reduce the deficit by firing across the face of goal. </p>\n<p>\nBut only the goal frame and a last-ditch Bennett block prevented Fulham taking an unassailable lead on the stroke of half-time as Dempsey hit the post from an acute angle and Dembele saw his follow-up deflected behind. </p>\n<p>\nNorwich boss Lambert brought on striker Simeon Jackson in place of defender Zak Whitbread for the second half in a 3-5-2 formation. </p>\n<p>\nKacaniklic was impressing on his Fulham debut and was unfortunate to see a superb right-footed curled effort tipped onto the crossbar by Ruddy four minutes after the restart. </p>\n<p>\nNorwich tightened up soon after and attacked with renewed vigour, with mark Schwarzer doing well to stop a Wes Hoolahan drive before Aaron Hughes brilliantly blocked Andrew Surman. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRussell Martin headed straight at Schwarzer from the resulting corner, before David Fox collected a booking for scything down Dembele. </p>\n<p>\nSurman saw a 25-yard free-kick deflect wide as the Canaries continued to press, efore Stephen Kelly burst through at the other end and was only thwarted by Bennett's late sliding tackle. </p>\n<p>\nThe chance began a change in momentum in the home side's favour, with Kacaniklic, Hughes and John Arne Riise all going close. </p>\n<p>\nFulham switched off in the final 15 minutes and duly conceded. </p>\n<p>\nMoments after substitute Wilbraham inexplicably shot wide, he made amends by reducing the deficit 13 minutes from time as his effort deflected in off Hughes. </p>\n<p>\nAs Fulham began to rock, Norwich threw bodies forward and only last-gasp defending prevented Lambert's side finding another goal. </p>\n<p>\nSchwarzer and his defence were being tested by the visitors, with Dickson Etuhu booked shortly after coming on against his former club. </p>\n<p>\nWilbraham and Kyle Naughton had efforts as the game came to a close, but the west Londoners held out. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Fulham: </b>Schwarzer, Kelly, Hangeland, Hughes, John Arne Riise, Murphy (Diarra 71), Dembele, Ruiz (Etuhu 82), Dempsey, Duff,
