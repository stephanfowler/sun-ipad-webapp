That included rape, incest, child prostitution and pornography. </p>\n<p>\nThe annual figure is equivalent to 444 attacks a week — or one kiddie abused every 20 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nJust as worryingly, only 2,135 of offences reported — ten per cent — led to someone actually being convicted and sentenced. Thousands of paedos escape scot-free. </p>\n<p>\nMr Brown, head of the NSPCC’s Sexual Abuse programme, said: “When you have a situation where more than 60 children are being sexually abused every day, something is very wrong. </p>\n<p>\n“The Government has to start treating the situation as seriously as they would if faced with an outbreak of chronic disease. </p>\n<p>\n“We also need a clearer picture of what is happening between an offence being reported and someone appearing in court. The police are doing their best to bring prosecutions but we need to understand why there is such a huge disparity between the figures. The fact there are repeat offences against some children also shows not all are one-off incidents.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLondon’s Metropolitan Police dealt with the most abuse cases, a total of 3,420. The Leveson Inquiry into Press standards has heard Scotland Yard has 150 cops working on its phone hacking investigation — and just 27 devoted to nailing paedophiles. </p>\n<p>\nLondon’s Deputy Mayor Kit Malthouse also told the inquiry the Met’s bill for probing phone hacking is forecast to hit £40million. </p>\n<p>\nIn contrast, £36million is spent annually on investigating child abuse in the capital. </p>\n<p>\nThames Valley Police, covering Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire, had the second highest child abuse figures, with 1,264 offences. Last month the force smashed an alleged child sex ring in the university city of Oxford. It is claimed 24 victims — some as young as 11 — were groomed, drugged and raped over a period of six years. </p>\n<p>\nSix men aged 26 to 37 are remanded in custody awaiting trial. </p>\n<p>\nA former officer with Thames Valley Police was jailed for 18 years in January for a campaign of sex abuse described by a judge as “one of the most despicable cases” he had heard. </p>\n<p>\nMohammed Younas, 43, of High Wycombe, Bucks, was convicted by a jury of 15 counts of rape of a girl over the course of eight years, from when she was seven years old. </p>\n<p>\nAylesbury Crown Court heard Younas, whose father was a colonel in the Pakistani Army, would rape his victim every other day at the height of the abuse. </p>\n<p>\nIn another case involving Thames Valley, pervert David Cox was jailed for two years in February for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. He was being monitored by the force after being banned from unsupervised contact with children by a court in Sussex. </p>\n<p>\nBut he attended services at St Ebbe’s Church, Oxford, where he mingled with children, including a vulnerable young girl. </p>\n<p>\nHe was only caught when a support worker at the hostel where he was living caught him downloading extreme pornography. </p>\n<p>\nWest Yorks was third in the police figures of child abuse cases, with 1,170 allegations. It was followed by Hampshire, which had 1,148. </p>\n<p>\nMore than 1,470 of the national total were aged five and under, 4,973 were ten to five and 14,819 were between 11 and 17. Six times as many girls (19,790) were abused as boys (3,218), the NSPCC said. </p>\n<p>\nThe figures released yesterday show a small drop from 2010, when a total 23,390 offences were recorded. </p>\n<p>\nBut the NSPCC’s Mr Brown said: “A concentrated effort has to be made if we are to start reducing this distressing level of offences, many of which are committed on extremely young and helpless children. </p>\n<p>\n“The NSPCC is doing what it can by using information like this from the police to tailor our treatment services. We are also pioneering new programmes, including our Schools Service, which aims to work with 1.8million kids aged seven to 11 over the next four years. </p>\n<p>\n“But we can’t tackle this problem by ourselves. </p>\n<p>\n“It requires a major effort from government and the public to give children the protection they need and to provide more therapeutic programmes — so the young victims of abuse can start to rebuild their lives.”\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\na.france@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n208 children saved by<br></br> Sarah’s Law in its first year<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h6>\nBy GRAEME WILSON, Deputy Political Editor </h6>\n<p>\nSARAH’S Law has protected more than 200 kids from predatory paedophiles and criminals in its first year, Theresa May will reveal today. </p>\n<p>\nCops have had more than 1,600 enquiries from parents wanting to check on an adult with access to their children. </p>\n<p>\nTheir investigations turned up at least 160 paedophiles — plus a further 58 who had committed other offences. </p>\n<p>\nThe news was welcomed last night by Sara Payne, whose eight-year-old daughter Sarah was murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nShe said the law, named after her daughter, was a vital weapon against child abusers. </p>\n<p>\nIt allows parents to ask cops to check the background of new partners or other adults with access to their children. </p>\n<p>\nMs Payne said last night: “If just one child had been kept safe as a result of Sarah’s Law then all the work to see it introduced would have been worth it. </p>\n<p>\n“The fact that it is hundreds of children is wonderful and testament to the fact the scheme is needed. </p>\n<p>\n“It sends out a message to convicted sex offenders that they cannot hide their criminal history.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMichelle Skeer, the Assistant Chief Constable of Cumbria, also praised the legislation. </p>\n<p>\nShe said it had helped protect children and ensured greater public confidence in the police and “other responsible authorities” in the monitoring of child sex offenders. </p>\n<p>\nMrs May will say today: “Thanks to Sarah’s Law, we know that more than 200 children have been protected from potential harm over the last year. </p>\n<p>\n“We’re doing everything we can to protect the public, and especially children, from predatory sex offenders by tightening the law and closing loopholes.”\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4225671/Paedo-jailed-after-victim-10-takes-pic-of-him-on-Nintendo-DSi.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Paedo jailed after victim, 10, takes pic of him on Nintendo DSi"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4235448/Theresa-May-says-web-spies-will-trap-killers-like-Ian-Huntley.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Web spies ‘will trap killers like Huntley’"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4222368/Kidnap-paedo-David-Bryant-jailed-30-years-after-his-crimes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Kidnap paedo jailed after 30 yrs"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4216717/Paedophile-Mohamad-Hatef-is-nicked-by-Sainsburys-shopper-in-Alton.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Paedo is nicked by shopper"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4203595/I-am-so-glad-we-were-burgledit-exposed-my-father-as-a-paedophile.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I am so glad we were burgled...it exposed my father as a paedophile"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4186262/Frank-Lampards-paedophile-uncle.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Lampard’s paedo uncle and girl, 13"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNN0401B---532g_1483932a.jpg","caption":"Abuse ... the 43 police forces in England and Wales recorded 23,097 child sex offences last year"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNN0407MUM---532_1483940a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNN0407SARA---5327_1483939a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNN0406JON-250c_1483937a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNN0406GXB-532_1483935a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/carousel-sex-offen_1483923a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Wife No4 ...

The politician yesterday posed happily with Putri — two years younger than his oldest child — at his South London home. </p>\n<p>\nHe said with a wink that he’d been awake to 2.45am, calling himself “indefatigable” — an apparent reference to his controversial description of Iraqi despot Saddam Hussein in 1994. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Scot — dubbed “Gorgeous George” — then revealed he’d been up until that time selecting council election candidates. </p>\n<p>\nClaiming he was interested only in talking about his new role in Parliament, he added: “Why would I discuss my personal life?”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<i>Galloway, born in a Dundee slum, was with first wife Elaine from 1979 to 1987.

If the subject of the image is under 18 then anyone who makes, possesses or shares the image commits a criminal offence. </p>\n<p>\n\"The consequences can be quite devastating for the person concerned.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Montagu told This Is Gloucestershire that modern technology was to blame. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It is very sad that our young people are exposed to such pornography, but it is one of the evils of modern technology. </p>\n<p>\n\"We simply have to continue educating the young to reap the benefits that modern technology offers but not to fall into the trap of misusing it. </p>\n<p>\n\"We must try to persuade them that we should not want to be involved in listening to or looking at anything that portrays a lack of dignity and respect for other people.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Posted ... porn video featuring 14-year-old boy and girl went on Facebook","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01484/facebook-phone_1484142a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01484/facebook_1484122a.jpg"},{"caption":"Boy, 14, held over facebook porn movie - video of teen and girl of same age is 'seen by thousands'","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01484/carosuel-facebook_1484152a.jpg"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f5e484648a7800001a"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Bikini babe ...

It’s all a bit bizarre.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRoyal Mail have accused Snowball of negotiating her way past the letterbox’s two spring-loaded covers and double brush guard to get to the hapless postie’s hand. </p>\n<p>\nIan added: “You have to stretch to even get your hand through the letterbox. At worst, this is just a cat wanting to play with someone wiggling their fingers through it. </p>\n<p>\n“Although I acknowledge that my cat is a very intelligent animal, she is not able to lift up a spring loaded flap; keep it open; push her paw through a double brush guard and maul an unsuspecting delivery person in the time it take to delivery of the letter.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIan, who has not had any post for the last week, has now put a cage around the letterbox and hopes this will be satisfactory to resume the service. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I respect postmen come out in all sorts of weather conditions but they are in serious danger of making the Post Office a laughing stock. </p>\n<p>\n“This has just made me think: ‘What on earth is going on with this world?’\n</p>\n<p>\n“I thought it was an early April Fool’s joke when I got the letter — I just can’t get my head around it at all.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIan originally received a letter on November 15 last year stating that Snowball was a “potential hazard”. </p>\n<p>\nThe letter stated: “Either ensure that your cat is kept away from the letterbox or provide an alternative safe delivery point.”\n</p>\n<p>\nHe wrote back to ask for clarification, but got no response until a letter was sent to him by Royal Mail delivery office manager Jamie Clarke last Thursday. </p>\n<p>\nMr Clarke wrote: “On 28/03/12 at 1430 hours... our delivery officer was trying to deliver a pack to you. </p>\n<p>\n“When they opened the letterbox your cat clawed out via the letterbox and cut our delivery officers finger quite deep. </p>\n<p>\n“This is the third such incident. As a result it has been found that the level of risk is unacceptably high.”</p>\n<p>\nIan says he does not know the details of when the other two incidents took place. </p>\n<p>\nA Royal Mail spokeswoman also could not confirm when the other two attacks were, as the sorting office had closed for the day. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: “There are around 4,000 animal attacks a year on Royal Mail people. These attacks cause great distress and in too many cases serious injuries. </p>\n<p>\n“If we feel that there is a risk from any animal we are committed to working with the customer to agree simple steps to ensure that we can deliver the mail safely.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Neighbour Glenys Armstrong, 54, said: “Snowball is a lovely cat and friendly.

Emergency services attend a seven-vehicle accident in Shotts, North Lanarkshire. </p>\n<p>\nThere were a number of other collisions and reports of cars sliding off the road in Tayside and Fife where some vehicles also became stuck in the snow in the Largoward and St Monans area. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRoads were closed in some areas due to the weather. </p>\n<p>\nAround four inches (10cm) of snow carpeted most parts of northern Scotland, with 7.5 inches (17cm) recorded in Aviemore and temperatures of minus 2.7C in Glen Ogle. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nScotland’s central belt was also hit by the wintry weather, which will gradually creep into northern England, parts of Wales and the Midlands in the coming 24 hours. </p>\n<p>\nScottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said: “This kind of weather is much more normal for Scotland than the superb weather we have had over the previous days. So we have had, for example, 124 gritters out overnight. </p>\n<p>\n“Because we’ve not had this kind of weather over previous weeks, it can catch people by surprise and what we’re saying is people should listen to the media, take on board any information they’ve got about the likely length of time to make their journeys and take the appropriate precautions.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nForecasters predict that the snow will move south. </p>\n<p>\nThe weather is in stark contrast to March’s hot weather: the only years to have had a warmer month in the past 100 years are 1938, 1948, 1957, 1990 and 1997. </p>\n<p>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"What a difference a week makes ... snow has replaced last week's sunny weather","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/scotland-weather-5_1483447a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/scot1_1483448a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/London-weather_1483450a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/scot2_1483449a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/snow-532a_1483476a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/snow-crash-532_1483492a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/UK_main_1483465a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/snow4-caro_1483497a.jpg"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f7e484648a7800004e"},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"U2 reinvented ... how The Edge and Bono might look performing on stage","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SUN_20120404-532e__1483949a.jpg","section":"showbiz","headline":"U2 change Direction","teaser":"THE Irish rockers are set to surprise fans with their boyband-style routines","byline":"By GORDON SMART, Showbiz Reporter","timestamp":"Wed, 04 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nU2 fans should brace themselves for a new twist to their famous live shows – four stools and standing up during key changes. </p>\n<p>\nThe Irish rock giants are planning to reinvent themselves as a boyband when they leap back into action later this year. </p>\n<p>\nBono, Larry Mullen Jnr, Edge and Adam Clayton — have been in touch with a collection of hit Swedish songwriters who helped make One Direction a global sensation. </p>\n<p>\nCarl Falk, who co-wrote the Brit award-winning What Makes You Beautiful and One Thing for the teen idols, revealed the secret plan, saying: “There’s a long way to go but we are doing something with U2.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBono has had a bad back for a few years, so hopefully it doesn’t mean choreographed dance routines. </p>\n<p>\nA source added: “The band are back in the studio getting a feel for new material after the last album No Line On The Horizon.

This is sooooooo funny.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRyan had moved the audience to tears as he sparked a guessing game over who the romantic ballad was for. </p>\n<p>\nAnd on Monday we revealed it was Katie, who met Ryan at college six years ago. </p>\n<p>\nBut she has told mutual pals: “We’re just friends.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRyan, also 19, had hoped his gamble to serenade Katie in front of millions on national TV would win her heart. </p>\n<p>\nHe even planned to whisk her away on holiday if he won the talent competition. </p>\n<p>\nBut in a crushing blow we can now reveal she fancies another pal. A source close to the pair, who did not want to be named, said last night: “I’m afraid it might be too late for Ryan. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s a great guy but Katie has got the pick of the men. </p>\n<p>\n“They are really good friends and have been for ages but that’s as far as it goes. </p>\n<p>\n“There is someone else she is keen on. I suppose she could change her mind and if he goes all the way in the competition, who knows.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRyan met Katie at Portmarnock Community College in Dublin and they became good mates. </p>\n<p>\nThe pair even went to their school prom together last September. </p>\n<p>\nRyan had harboured a secret crush on Katie all these years but never found a way of telling her until his audition on the smash show last Saturday. </p>\n<p>\nThe emotional performance had the audience sighing and crying and won him a string of yes votes from the judges at the Blackpool audition. </p>\n<p>\nSimon Cowell asked: “So that’s the first time she’s ever going to hear it? Wow. Well if that doesn’t work, nothing will.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRecalling their school prom date, Ryan told The Sun: “When I saw her in that dress, I thought she looked beautiful. </p>\n<p>\n“She makes me nervous. I don’t want to rush in. She’s my mate, she’s a nice girl and she has a beautiful smile. </p>\n<p>\n“If I win I’ll spend my £500,000 on a holiday for just the two of us and maybe a sparkly ring if she’s lucky.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Ryan’s dad last night put paid to any hopes of a fairytale romance blossoming from his stunt. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking from the family home in Loughshinny, Co Dublin, Brian said: “I don’t think there’s any chance of them getting together. </p>\n<p>\n“They’re just friends, they’ve been friends for ages. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s very fond of her. They’ve been mates since school. </p>\n<p>\n“Ryan wanted to tell her something and did it on national telly. </p>\n<p>\n“They are not an item and never have been. It’s not going to happen, unfortunately.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBrian added: “It’s gone massive, this, and we’re all very surprised.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRyan’s future on BGT is under threat because earlier this year he appeared on the Irish version of The Voice. He signed a contract with Universal Music and is now begging bosses to free him, hoping public support will win them over. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “On Britain's Got Talent </a>I came across much better. If I could sing in the finals it would mean the world.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>Ryan's a jig hit</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nSHOW bosses have been besieged with requests from couples begging to have Ryan O’Shaugnessy’s song as their first post-wedding dance. </p>\n<p>\nThe Irish crooner brought tears to viewers’ eyes with his heartfelt ballad No Name. </p>\n<p>\nHe told how he wrote the track for a mystery girl he wanted to go out with. She was later revealed to be Katie Keegan.

I might end up with one eyebrow or something.” </p>\n<p>\nHe continued: “I remember when I was 18, I was nowhere doing what they're doing, but it was a good time, they're like rabbits. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“They are building up such a huge fan base, they are going to be massive. I wouldn't mind a few fans camping out.” </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut he added: “I'm only over there for seven weeks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I don't want to spend too much time over there, I might get homesick. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ll miss my fans, my family and my new house.” </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I bought it in October but I’m finally moving in over Easter, I think my mum is a bit upset.” </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOlly caused a surprise of his own when he came in for his Biz Session – performing a gentle <b>PAUL WELLER</b> cover. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOf Broken Stones, he said: “I don’t think many people expect me to sing that song but I love it. I used to sing it in the pub in Whitham years ago. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“I'm a really big fan, Stanley Road is one of my favourite albums.” </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe added: “I bet Weller doesn't know who I am though. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I bet he wouldn't like the fact I'm from the X Factor. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“But I gave it my best.” </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Oh My Goodness is out now.</b> </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Make mine a treble ...

But Lily is certainly more youthful and current. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun, she says: “Someone told me they were listening to the radio and they were playing classic hits. At the end the DJ came on and said, ‘For all of you who don’t know, that was Phil Collins — Lily Collins’s dad’. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I thought that was the weirdest thing, just so bizarre. Even my dad has said to me, ‘You know, I am known as your dad now’.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n“But he is extremely proud and couldn’t be happier. He came to the premiere the other day and we were just like a huge family. It was so lovely to have Mum and Dad there. </p>\n<p>\n“It is a weird shift. I am doing what I am now because I am doing it — I never wanted to give anybody the ability to say I am doing something because of family.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUnderstandably, Lily is worried people will think having a famous father opened doors for her in the movie industry, giving her an unfair advantage. But there are plenty of sons and daughters of rock stars who have tried and failed to make it in Hollywood. </p>\n<p>\nPhil, 61, who was an actor before he became a rock star with Genesis, has commented about how difficult Lily’s family background has made it for her. He once said: “She’s always got this thing hanging around her neck — she’s Phil Collins’s daughter.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLily thinks Dad was just defending her and says: “He is probably just referencing what everyone assumes — that having the last name gives me an opportunity and protecting me from that.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhether being Phil’s daughter has helped or hindered, Lily certainly didn’t get her stunning looks from Dad. For those remarkable eyes she has mum Jill Tavelman to thank. </p>\n<p>\nLily says: “I have seen that more and more. I am seeing characteristics, things that I do that are very her. And I look at photos sometimes and see her smile and her laugh. More and more people are saying that now — and I love it.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJill was Phil’s second wife. They married in 1984 and divorced 12 years later. After the break-up, Lily, then seven, went to live with her mother in Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nThe split was said to be acrimonious, with Phil paying out £17million and finishing the relationship by fax. But now it seems they are friendly again. </p>\n<p>\nLily, whose birthday was on March 18, says: “I celebrated my 23rd with my mum and dad, who were both here in LA the day after the premiere. We had a very relaxed, quiet day together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough she mainly grew up in the States, Surrey-born Lily has fond memories of an English childhood spent in the company of some of the UK’s biggest stars — including Elton John, who used to babysit her. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “He is definitely a close family friend. I consider myself very European and more British at heart. </p>\n<p>\n“I am not your beachy Californian girl. I enjoy the cold. Whenever I come back to England I automatically relax and feel at home.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLily reckons spending her early years in England helped to prepare her for the Snow White role. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I grew up in England in the countryside in basically farmland and forests. </p>\n<p>\n“I used to run around pretending. I was read fairytales before bedtime and I was totally the young girl who loved fairytale princesses. </p>\n<p>\n“The idea of playing one never crossed my mind and when it happened, at first I thought it was a mistake. But it was an absolute honour and I was so excited to do it that the importance of playing this iconic role didn’t truly hit home until I finished shooting, so I didn’t get to be nervous about it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: “To play a character that is the fairest of them all is even hard for me to say — it is the most bizarre concept to me. </p>\n<p>\n“In our story Snow White never once looks in the mirror, so she is unaware of the beauty everyone is talking about. She doesn’t know what effect it has on people.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Lily too is confused by the effect she is having on people, with fan sites dedicated to her already springing up. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “It still shocks me that people are interested in me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“But I can still go about everyday life, go to the market and that kind of thing, without being followed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLily’s first acting role came at the tender age of <b>TWO</b> on BBC television comedy drama Growing Pains. </p>\n<p>\nBefore her adult acting career she worked as a journalist for American youth channel Nickleodeon and for British teen magazines such as Elle Girl. She admits it was a way to get experience in front of the camera and a job to do as she waited for her big chance in Hollywood. </p>\n<p>\nThe break came when she played the daughter of Sandra Bullock’s character in the Oscar-nominated 2009 film The Blind Side. After that success she decided to concentrate on acting. </p>\n<p>\nTalking about her time as a reporter, she says: “I was always pursuing acting at the same time. I was just auditioning but being told no and so I kept practising. At the same time I wanted to be doing something else. Then I was finally told yes on The Blind Side and there came a point when I had to decide whether the audience could believe me as the character when I was also on television as me.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDad Phil started acting young, having gone to drama school at 14 and appearing as the Artful Dodger in a London production of Oliver! </p>\n<p>\nLily says: “I have always loved dressing up.

She is not the type of girl who simply lives off her parent’s fame but wants to make her own way in the world. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “She’s a feisty, passionate young woman.

She has now been with Dave Norman, 28, a tiler, for 18 months and says she wouldn’t be happy in any relationship where she is not allowed to see her ex. They are all from Bristol. Lucy says:</b> </p>\n<p>\n“I met Dom in September 2008. We were both students and I fell for him because he was so easy to talk to. </p>\n<p>\nWe became great friends first, then evolved into boyfriend and girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\nWe moved in together after a year and all was going well until our mutual friend blurted out she had slept with Dom. </p>\n<p>\nI was utterly crushed and my trust of Dom evaporated. </p>\n<p>\nDespite my anger at him breaking us up, Dom and I would bump into each other at university, we had the same mutual friends and I found it impossible to ignore him. </p>\n<p>\nGradually we became friends again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe shared so much together in such an exciting period of our lives and that bond couldn’t be broken. </p>\n<p>\nWe talk about everything together and he’s a great listener. </p>\n<p>\nBut I’d never trust him as a boyfriend again. </p>\n<p>\nI met Dave a year after splitting from Dom and we hit it off. </p>\n<p>\nDave knows all about what happened between me and Dom. At first he couldn’t understand why I’d want to be friends with him. </p>\n<p>\nBut he soon came to understand how supportive Dom had been as a friend — and still is. </p>\n<p>\nSo far it’s working out nicely. </p>\n<p>\nThe boys get on fine when we meet up together but I’m not sure if they would be friends in their own right. </p>\n<p>\nDom and I meet up for coffees or early-evening drinks at least once a week. </p>\n<p>\nI don’t discuss relationship problems with him though, I have girlfriends for that. </p>\n<p>\nI feel lucky that I have a boyfriend who understands. If he didn’t, things could get complicated.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Boyfriend Dave says: </b>“I’m cool with Lucy’s friendship with Dom. </p>\n<p>\n“Dom and I are completely different — I wouldn’t go out drinking with him. </p>\n<p>\n“But he’s funny and I have to respect him because Lucy does.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ex Dom says: </b>“To throw away the bond Lucy and I formed would be impossible. </p>\n<p>\n“I know I screwed up but it was completely out of character and I’m very lucky to still have Lucy as a friend. </p>\n<p>\n“I’ve got friends who can’t be friends with their exes so I see myself as fortunate to have Lucy in my life still. </p>\n<p>\n“I really think we’ll be in touch for many years.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n<b>NO, says Suzanne Parker, 36 </b>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>\n<b>SUZANNE, who runs a menswear shop in Ormskirk, Lancs, was given an ultimatum: Stay friends with her ex and lose her boyfriend. She says: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’d known my ex, Martin, since I was five and we’d always been good friends. </p>\n<p>\nThree years ago we began dating, which turned out to be a big mistake. </p>\n<p>\nWhat was a friendship soon turned into bickering. </p>\n<p>\nAfter five months we realised we weren’t suited to one another and split. </p>\n<p>\nAt first it was a bit strange between us but once we got over the awkwardness of knowing we’d slept together, we fell back into being friends. </p>\n<p>\nTwo months after we split I began dating Adam, who I met through Facebook. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAdam was lovely and we seemed made for each other. </p>\n<p>\nI told Martin about Adam from the start. </p>\n<p>\nHe was very excited that I was starting to see someone new. </p>\n<p>\nThe two of them met about a month after Adam and I started dating. </p>\n<p>\nThey got on like a house on fire and we would often hang out together. </p>\n<p>\nDespite seeing how well they got on, I decided not to tell Adam that Martin and I had been an item. </p>\n<p>\nBut two years into our relationship, I was chatting with Adam about my past and casually mentioned I’d dated Martin. </p>\n<p>\nAs I told him I could see him become tense and within minutes he was furious. </p>\n<p>\nI tried to convince him nothing would ever go on between us, but he wouldn’t have it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe gave me an ultimatum — either stop talking to Martin or our relationship was over. </p>\n<p>\nI couldn’t believe it. I was hurt and shocked by his reaction. I told him he couldn’t control me and my friendships. </p>\n<p>\nBut he remained adamant it was Martin or him. </p>\n<p>\nI was torn. </p>\n<p>\nI didn’t want to sacrifice a friendship over somebody’s jealousy, but I’d really fallen for Adam and didn’t want to throw away what we had. </p>\n<p>\nFor the next month I carried on phoning Martin and each time Adam found out he went ballistic. We had the most awful rows. </p>\n<p>\nEventually Adam moved out. </p>\n<p>\nI really missed him and phoned to ask him to come home, but he told me that he only would if I stopped talking to my ex, Martin. </p>\n<p>\nI didn’t want to choose. </p>\n<p>\nI was terribly upset that it ended the way it did, but maybe this proves it wasn’t meant to be between us.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Security worker Adam Smith, 32, says: </b>“I didn’t like the idea of ex-boyfriends being in the background — it felt like an intrusion. </p>\n<p>\n“Suzanne wouldn’t have it though and it was stressing me out so I left. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s over now and it’s all because she wanted to stay friends with her ex.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Martin Hollenby, 33, a woodworker, says:</b> “It’s sad what happened, but I don’t see why Suzie and I couldn’t be friends. </p>\n<p>\n“There was nothing going on between us.

Twice Arshad, then 24, was asked by firefighters if anyone else was in the vehicle. Twice he said no. Arshad was sentenced to six years for causing death by careless driving while over the alcohol limit and while uninsured. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>From prison he sent two portraits of Emily to her mum Patricia, yet he refused to see her to explain what happened. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Here, Patricia, 51, talks to NIKKI WATKINS about her agony at being denied the right to ask him why he left her daughter to die.</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFOR Patricia, every day has been a living hell since losing her daughter. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “Being told Emily had died was too much to comprehend. Emily was caring, full of life and my best friend. To lose her so violently is unimaginable. Losing a child in such an awful way changes you. I will never again be the person I was.”\n</p>\n<p>\nPatricia’s agony has been heightened by Arshad’s seemingly callous behaviour towards her family. The hospital nurse, said: “Arshad sending the portrait was disgusting. He didn’t ask the prison authorities, who would have asked me if I wanted to receive anything. </p>\n<p>\n“He passed it to a mate to deliver and took that choice away from me. Later, I heard he had applied for early release and I knew I had to ask him questions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>“He refused to see me. But he had no qualms about sending me a portrait of my daughter framed by matchsticks after she burned to death.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nPatricia last saw college student Emily, who was studying to be an accountant, when she waved her off to her part-time job on November 1, 2008. </p>\n<p>\nThe mum — who lives in Dunstable, Beds, with lorry driver husband Tom, 49, and student son Jordan, 19 — says: “Emily had a supermarket job to help fund her studies. She headed out after work with friends. Near her curfew she sent a text to her brother Jordan, then 16, telling him she would be home soon. </p>\n<p>\n“Although we were a close family we hadn’t talked much about Arshad, her boyfriend of six months. I saw his car when he dropped her off but that was it. Every time I brought him up Emily would get embarrassed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nConfident her daughter was on her way home that terrible night, Patricia went to bed. She says: “At 5am the phone rang. Seeing my daughter’s bedroom was empty I started to panic. When Emily’s name came up on the phone screen I relaxed but it wasn’t her voice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“A man told me he was Arshad’s brother and that there had been an accident and Emily was missing. He asked if she was with me. A police officer came on the line and said he would call back when there was more news. </p>\n<p>\n“I tried to comfort myself with the thought that if Emily was seriously injured, the hospital would have been in touch. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“An hour later I opened the front door to the officer and heard the words, ‘I’m sorry’. I just knew and broke down.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe officer explained there had been a crash in the early hours. Emily had died. </p>\n<p>\nPatricia would learn later that Emily’s phone had been retrieved by Arshad as he escaped from the burning wreck. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nReeling in shock, Patricia asked to see her daughter’s body. She says: “It was then they told me I couldn’t identify her body. The car had caught fire and there was none. </p>\n<p>\n“Emily had never hurt anyone, why had this happened to us? She was so innocent, she didn’t deserve to die like this. Clinging to the bannister for support, I climbed upstairs to wake Jordan. The agony on his face will stay with me for ever. It was the worst moment of my life.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family, who are Catholics, were devastated not to be able to give Emily a traditional funeral service. Her coffin contained a body bag with just a few charred remains. </p>\n<p>\nPatricia says: “After the funeral, attended by more than 1,000 of her friends, my grief worsened. Overnight I went from being a tough, working mother to lying on the sofa just about able to breathe. </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I was haunted by images of her trapped, screaming for help.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShortly after the funeral, Patricia was told Arshad had been arrested but she was too consumed with grief to ask why. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWeeks later she bumped into him while visiting Emily’s grave. Patricia says: “We cried together, I hugged him and he kept saying he couldn’t remember anything.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, in May 2009, Arshad appeared at Luton Crown Court and admitted causing death by careless driving while over the drink drive limit and causing death by driving while uninsured. </p>\n<p>\nThe court heard he and Emily had been for a night out. Driving her home he lost control of the car, crashed into a tree and skidded into a field where the car caught fire. Patricia says: “What came next left me and my family stunned. </p>\n<p>\n“The court heard Arshad freed himself from the car but left Emily trapped inside. When witnesses called for emergency services, he didn’t even tell them she was in the car. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“He was asked by a paramedic and a firefighter if there was anyone in the car. To both he said no. </p>\n<p>\n“Firemen later realised Emily was in the car but by then it was too late. She had been injured during the accident but that hadn’t killed her. She had burned to death.”\n</p>\n<p>\nArshad maintained he could not remember what happened. He was sentenced to six years and banned from driving for eight. Patricia says: “I was disgusted one human could allow that to happen to another. </p>\n<p>\n“He’d had time to get Emily’s mobile phone but claimed he was in too much of a state of shock to remember she was in the car. I was left with no doubt that had he told someone she was in there, she might still be alive. </p>\n<p>\n“Emily’s death was utterly degrading. The anger and grief made me have suicidal thoughts.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Then, when Patricia thought things couldn’t get any worse, the story took another sick twist in March 2010.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nPatricia says: “Jordan had answered the door and was handed a parcel from Arshad. I gasped in shock. It was a sketch and a photo of Emily decorated with a clock. Both were framed with matchsticks. </p>\n<p>\n“To make frames out of matchsticks when he had let my daughter burn to death seemed hugely insensitive. I couldn’t look at them but I couldn’t just throw them in the bin because they were pictures of Emily. I had to put them in the loft. It was terrible. </p>\n<p>\n“Had he not considered asking me through the proper channels if I wanted to receive his gifts? </p>\n<p>\n<i>“It may be possible that he had not connected matchsticks with leaving his girlfriend to burn to death but perhaps that is being too kind.”</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLast year Patricia was told Arshad had applied for early release. She says: “I knew that to be able to move forward I needed to see him face to face. I asked if I could visit him in jail but he refused to see me. </p>\n<p>\n“He is such a coward. I hope he will change his mind before he is released, which I fear could be as early as this year. I’ve read books on grief, looking for advice, and one day I plan to write my own book to help others grieving in horrific circumstances. </p>\n<p>\n“But in the meantime I hope publishing the pictures of the wreckage in which my daughter died will help save another life by stopping others from getting in a car with a drunk driver. </p>\n<p>\n“Emily would have liked that.”\n</p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>Patricia is donating her fee for this article to Sisters Of St Clare Convent in Luton.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Agony ...

He claimed for accidental damage to his Italian-made wig. </p>\n<p>\nOne lovestruck motorist simply claimed: “My girlfriend kissed me, I lost control and woke up in hospital.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother insisted : “As I turned the ignition key I glanced at my mother-in-law and headed over the embankment.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis short-sighted client was obviously a pane. He told insurers: “I thought my window was down but found out it was up when I put my hand through it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA case of mistaken identity led to this case: “Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don’t have.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt’s a common problem. This driver said: “I was on the way home from the garden centre after buying some plants when a hedge sprang up obscuring my vision.”\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, when asked what gear they were in when their car crashed, one dozy claimant replied: “Reeboks and Wranglers.”\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Given the boot ... driver claimed on insurance after car was damaged by welly","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNF04CLAIMA--_1483615a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/SNF04CLAIMB-_1483616a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"Don't peck on me!","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4224984/Dont-peck-on-me.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f6e484648a78000029"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"In it to win it ...

I know it’s a controversial thing to get your kids involved in, but I think people read too much into it. </p>\n<p>\n“Their confidence has shot through the roof since they’ve started competing. It’s wonderful watching my kids doing so well. </p>\n<p>\n“There’s such a buzz about the UK scene — it’s fresh and exciting. It’s so rewarding being right at the forefront of it and I’ve never heard of as big a family as mine getting involved.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne’s obsession was sparked by seeing footage of American pageants and has escalated so much in the past 12 months that normal family life at their home in Lincoln has been put on hold. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “The glitz and glamour come at a high price. You’re talking at least £500 to £600 per child per competition. There’s the entry fee plus travel expenses, costumes and grooming on top. </p>\n<p>\n“The dresses alone cost £300 to £400, and you can’t wear them more than once. </p>\n<p>\n“The shoes cost up to £60 a pair. </p>\n<p>\n“Then there’s all the beauty, the hair, nails and tan.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEvenings are spent searching YouTube for clips of the biggest and best pageant stars for inspiration. </p>\n<p>\nMost nights after school the kids practise their choreography for the talent round and try out their hair and make-up. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “It’s the nature of the scene — to stay at the top, you’ve got to keep going bigger.”\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandma Joyce, 49, a former pub landlady, is a dab hand with a needle and has made countless “one-off” outfits for the troupe. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “It’s so important to have good costumes. My mum is brilliant. She’s really talented at making fabulous costumes, so thankfully we don’t have to buy them all.”\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery weekend, James, 29 — who is stepdad to the two eldest kids — looks after baby Niyah, while Leanne, Joyce, Tia, Courtney and Ellie check out shops nationwide to find fabrics and accessories. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “Our outgoings are sky-high. James and I have cut back so much. We’ve gone from taking two holidays a year to one and when we do go away we stay in the UK. </p>\n<p>\n“We don’t eat out much any more and I buy my clothes from budget stores such as Primark and Asda so I can plough money back in to the kids’ pageant wardrobe.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe result of all their effort is a mantelpiece full of awards. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “The kids are all naturals, especially Tia, who won the Tiny Miss North crown in her first ever competition. All my kids have the pageant bug — even my three-year-old son.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis year the family are going even further, as Tia prepares to become the first British competitor in the Dream Girls USA pageant in St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “In Tia’s last competition, she danced to Copacabana by Barry Manilow. </p>\n<p>\n“Some people think the song is inappropriate for an eight-year-old but she doesn’t understand the words. It’s just a good beat to perform to.” </p>\n<p>\nRecently Leanne and Joyce have found it hard to find the sort of bold, ostentatious outfits that they say are needed to stand out. </p>\n<p>\nSo they plan to launch their own online pageant boutique. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “Mum made the showgirl costume for the Copacabana dance and it went down a storm. </p>\n<p>\n“It’s really hard to find unique ‘wow-wear’ here and it’s expensive to ship it from the US. </p>\n<p>\n“This is an ideal opportunity to turn something we love into a business venture. There’s the market for it and it means that we’ll stay right at the forefront of pageant fashion.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe US pageant scene has been growing for decades and has received a lot of attention in the UK. </p>\n<p>\nIt was notorious US cable TV series Toddlers & Tiaras that first got full-time mum Leanne hooked. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “We would watch it as a family and I’d be blown away by the glamour. Tia loved it too and was the natural leader. </p>\n<p>\n“I think the other kids may have seen how much time I spent with Tia and felt a bit jealous. With six kids, there’s always rivalry.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly 15-year-old Josh has opted to stay out of the spotlight, though he helps by babysitting during pageant season, from March to October. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne is behind all of her kids when it comes to their pageant careers, but she insists she is realistic. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “We want to let them all dip their toe in and try it but I know it’s not for everyone.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAll the same, she wouldn’t want to see the kids quit on a whim — especially Tia, who has had a flush of wins. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “We’d never force her to do anything she didn’t want. But we’d be reluctant to let her just walk away. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s so good and we’ve invested so much. </p>\n<p>\n“Although it’s not all about the winning, it’s a lot of money to spend if you don’t succeed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne dismisses the objections that are often levelled at pageants, insisting the outlandish outfits and make-up are harmless dressing up. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: “Kids wear less during the summer holidays on the streets in Blackpool. </p>\n<p>\n“Strangers aren’t going to walk off the street and see my kids in a swimsuit, because all the events are ticketed. </p>\n<p>\n“And not every competition is full glitz. They’ve all done great in natural pageants too.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Woodalls intend to keep following their pageant dream for as long as they can. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: “I am so excited waiting for pageant season to get into full swing. </p>\n<p>\n“We’ll all be spending loads of time together doing what we love most.”\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By Dr LINDA PAPADOPOULOS, </b>Psychologist </p>\n<p>\nTHE notion of little girls enjoying dressing up is nothing new and there is nothing wrong with them role-playing. </p>\n<p>\nWhat is concerning is that in competitions such as these, they are encouraged to experiment with themes they may not be ready to deal with. </p>\n<p>\nThese girls are being judged on their appearance. They are aware that to succeed they not only need to act a certain way but to look a certain way. </p>\n<p>\nThis is an unhealthy and potentially dangerous message. </p>\n<p>\nWe also need to consider the impact of wearing clothes that are designed to highlight sexual characteristics they do not yet possess. </p>\n<p>\nJudging girls on how they look devalues them and teaches them to base their self-worth on being appealing to others. That is simply not fair to them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>Additional reporting: Naomi Rainey </b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"In it to win it ...

His owner, teaching assistant Amy Barratt-Singh, 25, from Birmingham, is a Scorpio. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “This confident and brave canine aims to protect and guard his family. From a young age you have been able to see early signs of his assertive, leadership potential. Sometimes this can come across to others as aggressive in style. </p>\n<p>\n“He is energetic and at times may well believe that he’s in charge. </p>\n<p>\n“There may be a power struggle between the signs of owner Amy and Bo-Duppy.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAmy says: “Bo-Duppy is certainly confident and brave. He is protective to the extreme and when we are in the street he will not let a stranger come anywhere near me. </p>\n<p>\n“He definitely shows leadership potential.

She is very home-loving and is always a bit unsure when we’re away on holiday.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLeo<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>July 23 - August 23 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nGERMAN shepherd Sky is two and a Leo. She lives in Shenfield, Essex, with mum-of-four Shelley Hutchins, 39, who was born on the cusp of Gemini and Taurus. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “This canine is loyal with a loving heart. She needs to shine and be treated like the queen she is. </p>\n<p>\n“Grooming procedures will give her the feeling of being adored. </p>\n<p>\n“Never ever scold, her loving heart simply couldn’t bear it. </p>\n<p>\n“Things between owner and pet should work well as long as Sky gets lavished with praise.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShelley says: “This is very true, Sky is loving, loyal and trusting but sometimes thinks her way is the right way and doesn’t listen.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nVirgo<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>August 24 - September 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBRITISH Blue cat Martha, two, is a Virgo. Her owner, Sun beauty writer Lauren Naylor, 31, lives in Wapping, East London, and is a Leo. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “Do make sure Martha’s bed and bowls are spotless as she’s a stickler for cleanliness. She can be a bit of a fussy eater too. </p>\n<p>\n“She thrives on predictability and routine. This is why Virgo dogs really are ideal candidates for training as a helper for the disabled. </p>\n<p>\n“A Virgo pet and Leo owner work well together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nLauren says: “This is very accurate. My dad, David, is disabled and she loves to sleep near him in his wheelchair or keep a watchful eye over him from the stairs.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLibra<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>September 23 - October 23 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCROSS-BREED Sophie, six, is a Libra. Owner Alexandra Newbury, 30, is a service adviser from Tamworth, Staffs and is a Capricorn. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “The Libra canine thrives in the company of a significant other and your relationship will be very special. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s well-mannered, so you can take her anywhere. </p>\n<p>\n“Balance and fairness are important to her, and she’ll expect the same high standards as you when it comes to dining and sleeping in a comfy bed. </p>\n<p>\n“Owner and pet will work well together as long as they spend a lot of time together.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlexandra says: “That is actually freaky as it describes her so well. She expects to sleep on my bed and always wants what I’m eating for tea. She is well mannered, gentle and calm. </p>\n<p>\n“You can take her anywhere. Our picture was taken in the pub where she charmed everyone.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nScorpio<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>October 24 - November 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLABRADOR Barney, three, is a Scorpio. He lives with Cancerian office worker Maggie Morgan, 42, in Hamble, Hants. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “The Scorpio canine tends to be suspicious by nature and terribly nosy which makes him an excellent choice as an airport sniffer dog. Your relationship is likely to be intense, as he may not be happy to share you. </p>\n<p>\n“He sometimes likes to hide things so you may one day stumble upon hidden treasures that perhaps you thought were lost. </p>\n<p>\n“In the stars, owner and pet are a good mix because both appreciate closeness.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMaggie says: “On every walk, Barney has his nose to the ground, sniffing out who has been out and about on his patch. </p>\n<p>\n“I’m sure he’d be an excellent sniffer dog if he’d been properly trained. </p>\n<p>\n“Only he knows where he keeps his stash of my socks and gloves.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nSagittarius<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>November 23 - December 21 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMOGGY Forbes, four, is a Sagittarius.

His sleep patterns differ on a nightly basis and he will often be awake all night if he is bored in the day. </p>\n<p>\n“He also likes nothing more than to go on an adventure – usually to stay at my parents’ house when I go on holiday.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nCapricorn<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>December 22 - January 20 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBLACK and white puss Freddie, six, is a Capricorn and lives with Libran teacher James Burrows, 32, in Colchester, Essex. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “The Capricorn pet takes life very seriously. He seems wise beyond his years. </p>\n<p>\n“He’ll enjoy showing you just how hard he can work and plod on until he gets it right. </p>\n<p>\n“This is a good combination of pet and owner as Freddie will feel very settled.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJames says: “Freddie is a very clever cat and loves to show this off. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s forever catching birds and mice, and loves to bring them to me and show me what he has achieved.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nAquarius<b><br></br></b> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>January 21 - February 18 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCROSS-BREED pooch Ralph, two, is an Aquarius – just like writer owner Sally Windsor, 32, of Crawley, Sussex. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: “An Aquarian canine is special and highly intelligent. He’s a one-off, blessed with an optimistic outlook. </p>\n<p>\n“He’s very interested in others and always makes them feel welcome. </p>\n<p>\n“His favourite activity is to run with a pack of canine friends. </p>\n<p>\n“Horoscope-wise owner and pet are a good combination.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSally says: “Ralph is always trying to make new friends in the park, so he’s a typical Aquarius. </p>\n<p>\n“He doesn’t like sticking to the rules – a bit like me – so the two of us are always getting into trouble together.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>Pisces<br></br> </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>February 19 - March 20 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nJACK Russell Porky, three, is a Pisces.

She offers unconditional love. </p>\n<p>\n“The star signs of owner and pet work, if the owner takes the pet everywhere.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison says: “Porky loves being around people as she’s very affectionate and gets jealous if I give others dogs too much attention. </p>\n<p>\n“She’s very lazy – forever dozing when the rest of the house is up and about.”\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Expert ...

See how here","timestamp":"Mon, 02 Apr 2012 11:38:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nLESS is more when it comes to working out. Doing as little as four minutes – or one “HIT” – can be better for you than an hour’s slog. </p>\n<p>\nThe four-minute, high-intensity training session can increase your aerobic and anaerobic capacity and speed up the metabolism, helping you burn more fat and make you look 200 per cent leaner than a traditional 60-minute aerobic workout. </p>\n<p>\nKnown as the closest thing we have to a fitness miracle, the HIT workout is loved by researchers and fitness pros alike for its fat-torching abilities and simplicity. </p>\n<p>\nCeleb fans include Jessica Biel and Cameron Diaz. </p>\n<p>\nHIT workouts are not easy, but are appealing to time-starved mums, working women and anyone juggling a hectic life. </p>\n<p>\nSun fitness expert Nicki Waterman says: “My advice is to combine your plan with 30 minutes of aerobic exercise like fast walking, jogging, swimming, cycling or dancing, for example, to get the maximum effect. </p>\n<p>\n“To do a HIT, simply pick an exercise and set a timer for 20 seconds on and ten seconds rest. </p>\n<p>\n“Do the exercise as hard as you possibly can for 20 seconds and then rest for ten, repeating eight to 20 times in total. And remember, you have to work to 100 per cent maximum intensity. By the end of the four minutes you should feel like you’ve done a full workout and have nothing else to give.”\n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out my favourites to get you started for one week. </p>\n<p>\nBut please check with your doctor before starting this exercise programme. And always warm up and cool down for at least five minutes before and after each HIT session. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MONDAY:</b> <b>Skipping</b> </p>\n<p>\nCARDIO and coordination all in one. Take a skipping rope and jump as fast as you can, using whichever foot pattern you like. </p>\n<p>\nOptions include both feet together, high knees, the “boxer shuffle” with heels in front, alternating feet, and butt-kickers. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Make sure your rope is long enough before you start – nothing ruins a good HIT workout like getting whipped across your calves. </p>\n<p>\nTo check for proper length, stand in the centre of your rope and pull the handles straight up. They should come at least as high as your armpits. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TUESDAY:</b> <b>Jumping Lunges</b> </p>\n<p>\nYou already know and love (to hate?) lunges for their butt-blasting ability. Add a jump in between alternating legs to up the difficulty and cardio factor. </p>\n<p>\nStart by stepping your right foot forward into a deep lunge, until your leg is parallel with the ground. Then jump, bringing your back (left) foot forward and landing in a lunge. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> You can step through each lunge if jumping gets too hard. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDNESDAY:</b> <b>Box Jumps</b> </p>\n<p>\nFind a weight bench, or a step that hits somewhere between your shins and your knees. </p>\n<p>\nStand in front of it and jump on top of the bench/step with both feet together. </p>\n<p>\nJump back to the floor, again with both feet together. Try not to rest when you land and jump right back up again. </p>\n<p>\nIf this is too difficult, you can do step-ups onto the box instead. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THURSDAY:</b> <b>Mountain Climbers</b> </p>\n<p>\nMake a triangle with your hands and feet on the floor with your butt up in the air. Bring one leg towards your chest. Keeping hands on the ground, jump to switch your legs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Just quickly touch each toe down so you’re not resting by putting whole foot down. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>FRIDAY:</b> <b>Hindu Squats</b> </p>\n<p>\nThese are similar to a traditional squat but instead of stopping when your thighs are parallel to the ground, you continue down, dropping your butt towards your heels until your fingertips brush the ground. </p>\n<p>\nGoing through the full range of motion gets your heart rate up faster and engages more muscles. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Don’t be afraid – contrary to popular belief, researchers now say that for healthy people, squatting to the ground won’t hurt your knees. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SATURDAY: Bicycle Sprints</b> </p>\n<p>\nBikes are perfect for engaging your whole lower body and really getting your heart rate up for those 20 seconds. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> It’s a little easier to time and to rest on a stationary bike – you can just take your feet off the pedals for ten seconds rather than trying to start and stop/coast on the road. </p>\n<p>\nThe HIT diet plan </p>\n<p>\n<b>SUN nutritionist Amanda Ursell says:</b> “If your aim is to lose weight, then you need to combine your workout with a style of eating that provides energy to exercise, yet cuts empty calories that are keeping your body mass index high. </p>\n<p>\n“Timing of your meals and snacks is especially important because your body needs fuel to cope with the HIT workout before you start and, once you have finished, to allow your muscles to recover and be ready for the next hard session. </p>\n<p>\n“Here’s how to eat to lose weight but keep your body healthy and able to cope with the HIT plan over the coming week.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Before you train:</b> Whether you train before breakfast, before lunch or at the end of the day before dinner, have something like a handful of raisins, a banana or even a small smoothie an hour to 30 minutes before you start. </p>\n<p>\n<b>During training:</b> Drink “to thirst”. This simply means have a drink when you feel the need and stop once you no longer feel thirsty. </p>\n<p>\n<b>After training:</b> Have your meal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner within half an hour of finishing. If you can’t manage this, have another small snack like some dried fruit or a cereal bar. </p>\n<p>\n<b>YOUR DAILY DIET</b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Breakfast:</b> This is not the week to skip breakfast, however rushed your daily schedule. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are training early, have breakfast once you have finished. If not, make time to have it before you leave the house. </p>\n<p>\nHave a breakfast of porridge made with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk with some dried fruit such as chopped apricots; a wholegrain cereal such as Oatibix or Weetabix or a fruit salad which includes a banana with some zero per cent fat Total Greek yoghurt and a handful of sunflower seeds. </p>\n<p>\nAlternatively, have two poached or boiled eggs with two pieces of toast and a glass of orange or apple juice. </p>\n<p>\nHave a glass of water and your usual cup of tea or coffee using skimmed milk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-morning:</b> Have a handful of nuts such as almonds, cashews, pistachios or Brazil nuts with an apple, orange or a pear and a glass of water. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lunch:</b> Build your lunch around an average-sized portion of carbohydrate foods that give you a steady supply of energy. These include pitta breads, tortilla wraps, bread, pasta, noodles, or a baked potato. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich food such as tuna, chicken, turkey, lean slices of roast beef, hard-boiled eggs, prawns, cottage or ricotta cheese, pulses such as baked beans, peas or lentils, tofu or Quorn products. </p>\n<p>\nHave some veg with these such as tomato and cucumber in a sandwich, lettuce and spring onions in a wrap or pitta or salad with a baked potato and baked beans. Always have some water with your lunch. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-afternoon:</b> A couple of oat cakes with some cottage or ricotta cheese and berries; a slice of peanut butter on toast; an apple with a small matchbox-size piece of reduced-fat Cheddar or a handful of mixed nuts and raisins. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dinner:</b> As with lunchtime, dinner needs to be a mix of an average-size serving of carbohydrate-based foods such as new boiled potatoes, pasta, rice or noodles. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich foods such as lean red meat – lean mince, a lean pork chop or lean roast lamb; Turkey, chicken or ham; grilled, baked or canned fish; tofu, Quorn mince or “chicken” pieces, pulses such as baked beans. </p>\n<p>\nAlso add some vegetables. Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, green beans, sweetcorn, tomatoes, onions – whichever you enjoy and find easy to prepare. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Fan ...

She was strict, but wanted a daughter who could look after herself. </p>\n<p>\nI was not the easiest of girls to bring up. From very young I seemed to know what I wanted to do in life — singing, dancing, acting. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant my mum had to drive for miles to take me to various classes. She was always encouraging about self-improvement. </p>\n<p>\nShe took me to auditions in Los Angeles, which was on the other side of the country from where we lived in Florida. </p>\n<p>\nI was born in Oak Ridge, a small town in Tennessee, but was brought up mostly in St Petersburg, Florida, after my mother remarried. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she and Dad were together, they did not have much money. But I was happy as a kid. </p>\n<p>\nIt made me realise you don’t have to be rich to be happy. My dad used to hunt ducks and my mum would put them in the pot. We lived modestly. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum says I was born really ballsy. She’s put up with it very well. </p>\n<p>\nI attended a Pentecostal church and then a Christian school. I had to obey strict rules at school and at home. I was grounded a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI got a diploma from a correspondence programme. It was the deal I made with my mum. I had to have a real diploma before she would allow me to drop out of Christian school and move to Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some struggles along the way, which my mum has seen me through. I am also not the easiest of people to be friends with. </p>\n<p>\nI think it is my fault. I work away from home and have learned to be on my own. </p>\n<p>\nI don’t socialise much on a film set and don’t have to become best friends with the people I work with. </p>\n<p>\nThere is a saying in Hollywood that what happens on a film set stays on a film set. But if I’d ever dated a co-star, it would have been downright depressing. Most actors would not appeal to most women, if they actually met them. </p>\n<p>\nI met Brian when I was 18. I was too young to remember his show, Beverly Hills 90210, so I didn’t know who he was. But I knew I was instantly in love. </p>\n<p>\nThere is no secret to being a sex symbol. I play the game, that’s all. </p>\n<p>\nIf people want to think of me as wild and crazy, that’s up to them. The fact is, I’ve only had two serious boyfriends in my life — and I married one. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI have the same hang-ups as any other girl. Am I too fat? Too thin? Do I wear the right clothes? You think about it so much, it can hurt how you live. </p>\n<p>\nSo am I insecure? God, yes. Show me a woman who says she’s totally secure about everything in her life and I will show you a pain in the ass. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some bad moments along the way, during which calls to my mum have meant a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI lived in New York, doing TV comedy Hope & Faith, and it was cold and miserable. </p>\n<p>\nI was either at work or home in a little apartment, on my own. I let whole days slip by, doing nothing. </p>\n<p>\nI am confident in how I project myself but not in terms of how I look. It all came to a head when I was making 2008 film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People in London. </p>\n<p>\nThere was one scene in which I danced around in lingerie. I suddenly felt like I couldn’t do the scene and asked if I could wear a skirt. </p>\n<p>\nThe director, quite rightly, said it would look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nBut I was not happy. It ended up with the producer serving me a beer before the scene. I was tired from working non-stop on several films, was suffering from jet lag on the trip to England and started to worry about my ability. </p>\n<p>\nThat’s where Mum comes in. I called her a few times from London and she was able to calm me down and encourage me. </p>\n<p>\nI am still her little girl, whatever way you want to look at it. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"'Mum says I was born ballsy' ... actress Megan Fox","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02FOXX_1482370a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02MEG2-_1482371a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"Is Megan Fox expecting a baby?","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4225465/Is-Megan-Fox-expecting-a-baby.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"The Dictator will rule screens this Spring","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4225048/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-stars-in-new-trailer-to-The-Dictator.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Megan Fox serves up a tasty treat in new advert","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4192011/Megan-Fox-serves-up-a-tasty-treat-in-new-advert.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Megan's the face of an Angel in latest shoot","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4164565/Megan-Fox-is-the-face-of-an-Angel-in-latest-shoot.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"My tattoos are a Meg-a mistake","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4160020/Megan-Fox-tattoo-Star-is-having-her-Marilyn-Monroe-inking-lasered-off.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":{"#":"Megan Fox is back in her bikini"},"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4145794/Megan-Fox-looks-hot-in-her-bikini-in-Kona-Hawaii.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f8e484648a7800005e"},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Fashion tribe ... be bold with bright shades","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30WOM6--_1480589a.jpg","section":"woman","headline":"Mex 'n' match","teaser":"AS fashion goes Aztec with graphic prints and bold colours, we show you how to get the look on High Street","byline":"By SASKIA QUIRKE","timestamp":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nTRIBAL fashion is taking over this season, with the bold look top of the trends. </p>\n<p>\nStyle warriors will love the hot colour combinations and mixed-up graphic print clashes inspired by old Mexico. </p>\n<p>\nMust-have labels Burberry Prorsum and Peter Pilotto showcased the look on their catwalks and now savvy stores such as Asos and Topshop are cashing in on it. </p>\n<p>\nAccessories are key – think raffia, beading and ethnic prints, with brands such as Evans going all-out with colourful woven bracelets and necklaces. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Here <b>SASKIA QUIRKE</b> takes a closer look at the trend that’s straight out of Mexico’s Aztec past and on to the High Street. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MAIN IMAGE LEFT:</b> Dress, £20, very.co.uk</a>; lime skirt, £35, and wedges, £75, both Topshop; earrings, £12, Freedom at Topshop </p>\n<p>\n<b>MAIN IMAGE CENTRE:</b> Coat, £99.99, Zara; tribal dress, £13, Primark; earrings, £12, Freedom at Topshop </p>\n<p>\n<b>MAIN IMAGE RIGHT:</b> Jumper, £28, Littlewoods; leopard print top (worn underneath), £20, River Island; shorts, £28, Topshop; shoes, £80, Aldo; ring, £20, Freedom at Topshop </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>LEFT:</b> Jacket, £150, Topshop Boutique; vest, £5, Primark; trousers, £40, Topshop </p>\n<p>\n<b>RIGHT:</b> Black top, £80, Topshop; neon print skirt, £40, Topshop </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Fashion tribe ... be bold with bright shades","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30WOM6--_1480589a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30WOM1--_1480590a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"How to dress like Alesha Dixon","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4223537/Top-stylist-on-Alesha-Dixons-make-over.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":{"#":"What your clothes say about YOU"},"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4221210/What-sense-of-style-says-about-YOU.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Which push-up is bust?","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4218830/Which-push-up-bra-is-best.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"I see your trew colours","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4217083/Star-style-steal-I-see-your-trew-colours.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Go bananas for a tasty new trend","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/4232005/Go-bananas-for-a-tasty-new-trend.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f8e484648a7800005f"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Quirky ...

Their clothes may act as armour, diverting attention from them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nCameron Diaz </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Style:</b> The film star’s relaxed look indicates a more carefree and grounded personality. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret:</b> When someone feels they are seen chiefly as a sex object, they may downplay their feminine side to show there is more to their character. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nKate, Duchess of Cambridge </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Style:</b> As a younger Royal, Kate could push the boat out more with her outfits but plays it safe. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret:</b> Kate probably likes to maintain routine and please others. But some conservative dressers may long to break free. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nChristina Hendricks </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Style: </b>The vampish Mad Men actress can seem aloof and untouchable. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret:</b> Someone who dresses like this may not feel sexy inside. She might be over-compensating to cover insecurity. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nBeyonce </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Style:</b> The singer’s trademark jewellery reveals a powerful personality who is happy to show she is on top. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret: </b>Lots of flash or expensive gear can mask a deeper insecurity that makes the wearer feel a need to prove themself. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nHolly Willoughby </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Style: </b>Holly’s style is feminine and traditional, but with a twist of sexiness. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret: </b>The girl next door may secretly wish to be more assertive and outgoing.

It’s incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n“<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: “I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I’d try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n“For breakfast, I’d have four slices of toast. For lunch I’d make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n“Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I’d never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n“Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.”\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: “I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn’t dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n“So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges — you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n“Worth more than £3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class — purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: “I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.”\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n“So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I’d done.

Manchester United never depend on one player. </p>\n<p>\n“If you look at the past, players have left and fans have said how are we going to cope? </p>\n<p>\n“But the manager is the best at replacing players and the team still win titles and trophies. </p>\n<p>\n“That is why Manchester United are so special.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was not part of United’s plan to play the likes of Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Tom Cleverley and Danny Welbeck as often as they have this season. </p>\n<p>\nBut the quintet have not shirked the responsibility of first-team football and Vidic believes their performances give United great hope for the future. </p>\n<p>\nHe added: “We didn’t expect the young players would play so many games and have such influence on the team. </p>\n<p>\n“This is a great plus for the club. </p>\n<p>\n“Obviously we have had some injuries over the past year, which is another difficult thing we have gone through, but we have coped and been very competitive with Manchester City. </p>\n<p>\n“Now we are at the top of the league and have a big chance to win it.”\n</p>\n<p>\nVidic has ruled out the possibility of a return to action before the end of the season. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “I am not pushing. I am lucky, the manager and the physios and the doctor weren’t trying to beat the record. </p>\n<p>\n“As soon as I got the injury and had the operation, I knew I wouldn’t be back.

City — W7,D4,L4.</p>\n<p>Astonishingly, since their 6-1 thrashing of United at Old Trafford, City have taken just 12 points from a possible 30.</p>\n<p>This suggests they don’t like it up ‘em. That too many of their players are homers.</p>\n<p>And Mancini has not been able to do a thing about it.</p>\n<p>The Italian has had almost two and a half years to build a championship-winning side. And yet he still appears to have come up short.</p>\n<p>Compare this with Jose Mourinho, another manager blessed with limitless funds, at Stamford Bridge. In his first two years, Chelsea won back-to-back titles.</p>\n<p>City fans will say that Mourinho had considerably more to build on seeing Chelsea had finished second the season before.</p>\n<p>Yes, but Mourinho still knew what was missing. As such, he brought in Petr Cech, Ricardo Carvalho, Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba.</p>\n<p>As for Mancini, he was not exactly building from scratch.</p>\n<p>He already had Joe Hart, Micah Richards, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Joleon Lescott, Kolo Toure, Gareth Barry, Nigel de Jong and Carlos Tevez.</p>\n<p>He also decided he could do without Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz, Shay Given and Wayne Bridge.</p>\n<p>It was hardly a blank canvas.</p>\n<p>To that he has added players valued at £230 million.</p>\n<p>What’s gone wrong? Well, Stefan Savic was a bad buy, James Milner will never be anything more than support cast, David Silva has run out of steam, Yaya Toure hasn’t been the same since the African Nations Cup while Adam Johnson, one of the only threats out wide, is in and out of the side.</p>\n<p>Edin Dzeko? An expensive enigma. Which leaves us with Tevez and Mario Balotelli.</p>\n<p>And here, perhaps, we should look at Alex Ferguson for the self-help manual on how to deal with problem players and the circus around them.</p>\n<p>Tevez did well enough at Old Trafford but, once his agent started to make outrageous demands, he shipped the Argentinian out. Just as important, he got his corrosive advisor off the premises.</p>\n<p>But the poison would soon resurface at City despite Tevez’s huge popularity. Mancini’s pugnacious attitude didn’t help, either, and the final dug-out skirmish was inevitable.</p>\n<p>All round, Mancini’s body language has been poor.</p>\n<p>As for Balotelli, perhaps he was seen as the player to turn a good team into winners. Like Eric Cantona at United.</p>\n<p>Except Ferguson could handle Cantona. Mancini, who should have known better, has more or less run out of excuses for Balotelli.</p>\n<p>Mourinho got it right when he called the kid “unmanageable”. Certainly at this stage of his career.</p>\n<p>City fans will claim they have missed Kompany and Lescott at a vital time. United, though, have suffered far more with long-term injuries to Nemanja Vidic, Darren Fletcher, Tom Cleverley and Antonio Valencia.</p>\n<p>All this just highlights the job Ferguson has done this season, building an unbeatable team ethos among a squad that, on paper, doesn’t compare with City’s.</p>\n<p>There is a real hunger — from the young players all the way through to Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs — while you get the impression that certain City players have just followed the pound notes.</p>\n<p>It was well put the other day when Ferguson’s squad was described as more than the sum of their parts, Mancini’s less so.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was down to what the respective managers could get out of them.</p>\n<p>After City’s 3-3 draw with Sunderland, the official Bluemoon blogger wrote: “Be disappointed we dropped two points. Be disappointed we have handed the initiative to United. Be disappointed if we don’t come back to win it.</p>\n<p>“But look at the bigger picture. The title is certainly coming and it’s coming soon.”</p>\n<p>Yet City’s owners will be forgiven for thinking that if they couldn’t win the title this year what chance next?</p>\n<p>This, remember, is the season when United are set to win their 20th championship with a team that even their own supporters regard as one of the weakest in Ferguson’s 25 years at the club.</p>\n<p>The season when Chelsea went into serious decline and Arsenal imploded in the first month.</p>\n<p>When Spurs, as ever, folded when the pressure was on.</p>\n<p>The season when City didn’t have a better chance.</p>\n<p>Sheikh Mansour will be asking his advisers one last question: would we do better under Mourinho than Mancini?</p>\n<p align=\"right\">steven.howard@the-sun.co.uk</a></p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"WRONG MAN FOR THE JOB? ... faltering City boss Roberto Mancini","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/mancini_1483657a.jpg"},{"caption":"Steven Howard says it is a no brainer for Man City to get Jose Mourinho in","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/HOWARD-SPLASH2_1483752a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"We have no fear","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4237212/Ashley-Young-The-pressures-all-on-Man-City-now-not-us.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Mourinho slams City rumours","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4236699/Jose-Mourinho-slams-Manchester-City-transfer-rumours.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"I won’t ditch Mario","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4235183/Roberto-Mancini-insists-he-wont-ditch-bad-boy-Mario-Balotelli.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f7e484648a78000040"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"I BELIEVE ... but RVP was not always so sure","image":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/rvp_1483669a.jpg","section":"sport","headline":"Robin reliant","teaser":"ACE admits he became Arsenal’s main man only because Adebayor left","timestamp":"Wed, 04 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>ROBIN VAN PERSIE admits he became Arsenal’s main man only because Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor was shown the door.</p>\n<p>The Dutchman has bagged 54 goals since the start of 2011, making him one of the most prolific marksmen on the globe.</p>\n<p>But he revealed he was happy to play second fiddle to Adebayor until Arsene Wenger sold him to Manchester City in 2009.</p>\n<p>Van Persie said: “I was hoping to play as a second striker.

When results aren’t good, it’s always down to the manager.\n</p>\n<p>\n“But with Robbie in charge we have found more respect in ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Robbie has brought in some new ideas and instilled great confidence in us.\n</p>\n<p>\n“And we soon began to realise that we are still a great team with great players.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“We have built from our victory in Robbie’s very first game in charge and we have gone from strength to strength since then. I wasn’t expecting Andre to leave.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I was very happy when he arrived because I grew as a player when he was the boss. He gave me more freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\n“His relationship with the players was good. Of course, there is discontent when you don’t play but I never saw these things ending in fights as some people claimed.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWith a 1-0 lead from last week’s first leg in Lisbon, Chelsea already have one foot in the semi-finals. Yet Ramires insisted the job against his old team is still a long way from finished and warned: “We’ve got an important advantage but we’ll face a serious challenge.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Benfica will be highly motivated and will do everything they can to stop us.\n</p>\n<p>\n“There is already a lot of talk about the semi-finals but no one in the Chelsea dressing room is thinking about that yet.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We are the last English club in Europe and we will do our best for the fans to make sure we stay in this competition.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRamires’ first job at Stamford Bridge tonight will be to apologise to fellow Brazilian Emerson... and then rip the Benfica full-back apart again.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Blues star identified Emerson as the weak link before the first leg of their quarter-final last week.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd his prediction proved spot-on as he exposed Emerson to the wrath of the Portuguese fans before helping set up the only goal of the game for Salomon Kalou.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Ramires was adamant he did not mean any disrespect to his opponent. He added: “I’d like to apologise to Emerson. I expressed myself badly.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I said that I meant the Benfica team as a whole and did not mean him specifically.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Everything fell on him and I’d like to say sorry because I didn’t mean to disrespect him. I will apologise to him personally before the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We always have to respect a fellow professional, especially one who is playing for Benfica. If he is playing for them, it’s because he has quality.”\n</p>\n<p>\nYet Ramires’ remorse will not prevent him from seeking to finish off the Portuguese outfit and book Chelsea’s place in the Champions League semi-finals.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he sees the European Cup as a real opportunity to end a miserable season with a bang. Ramires, who joined Chelsea from Benfica for £19.8million in August 2010, added: “The Champions League can save our season and that’s why we’re giving it everything and also in the League to guarantee a place next year.”\n</p>\n<p>\nRamires’ future is already assured after he signed a new five-year deal at the Blues the day after AVB was sacked.\n</p>\n<p>\nFamed for his incredible stamina, Ramires has been working hard in the gym at Chelsea’s Cobham HQ to add some extra muscle to his slender frame.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: “I started trying to bulk up when I was still at Benfica. I took supplements and did a lot of muscular work.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’ve carried on with that programme in the gym at Cobham and with the food supplements and the results can be seen on the pitch.\n</p>\n<p>\n“When I was at Benfica I weighed 10st 5lbs. Now I’m 11st.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I’m firmer and stronger and that extra weight makes a real difference on the pitch, particularly in England when there is so much physical contact involved.”\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"CHIN UP ...

He believes the champions have shown they have the bottle to go the distance while their neighbours have cracked under the heat. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe told Match of the Day magazine: “The pressure has always been on City — there aren’t any nerves coming from our side. </p>\n<p>\n“We don’t play with fear and we haven’t got any nervousness going into games. </p>\n<p>\n“We’ve got the momentum going into the final stretch of the season.”\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the time City play Arsenal on Sunday they could be eight points adrift of United, who have a lunchtime clash with QPR the same day. </p>\n<p>\nYoung added: “We have another massive game on Sunday and it’s not going to be easy. But we play before City and can put ourselves eight points clear of them which at this stage of the season is massive. Winning at Blackburn on Monday was a huge result. This is a crucial time of the season for us — everyone knows that.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a summer spending spree and with young players being blooded, this was always viewed as a season of transition for United. </p>\n<p>\nBut they look like ending it with a 20th top-flight crown and Young believes manager Alex Ferguson has got the blend just right. </p>\n<p>\nHe says the youngsters have learned a great deal from veterans Ryan Giggs, 38, and Paul Scholes, 37, who came out of retirement in January. </p>\n<p>\nBoth played key roles in the vital win over Blackburn and Young feels they still have plenty to offer. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “The younger players have taken over this season, with their music and general loudness. </p>\n<p>\n“But if someone like Ryan Giggs or Paul Scholes starts talking we all sit down and listen. I asked the boys about Scholesy as soon as I joined and they said he was unbelievable in training. </p>\n<p>\n“He still pings the ball around like you wouldn’t believe.” Ferguson also believes the old heads have been the key to United’s season as they close in on yet another title. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “It’s down to experience. It never fazes them and they can handle it. We’re doing okay right now. </p>\n<p>\n“Scholes and Giggs are unparalleled of course but I think Rooney has four title medals, Rio five, Michael Carrick has got a few. </p>\n<p>\n“Even people like Rafael has got two or three. So it all adds to the experience, and that’s valuable at this time of the season.”\n</p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, Sunderland pair Phil Bardsley and Lee Cattermole have told City: You’re not as good as you think you are. </p>\n<p>\nThe pair were not impressed by Roberto Mancini’s men as the Black Cats bagged a point in a 3-3 draw at the Etihad on Saturday. </p>\n<p>\nScotland international Bardsley believes all the hype surrounding City is way off the mark. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: “They weren’t the team that they’ve been made out to be. They weren’t that impressive.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Sunderland skipper Cattermole reckoned City were not up for the battle. </p>\n<p>\nHe insisted: “We took City apart on their own pitch. Once we got the ball down, I didn’t think they had the hunger to chase it down.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<b><i>Match of the Day Magazine is on sale at all good newsagents now.</i></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"UNITED FRONT ...

In the first game Benfica had many chances. They do have a great result winning 1-0 away but let’s wait until tomorrow night. Both teams would be difficult. We’re happy to be in the semi-finals for the fifth consecutive season.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf Chelsea see off Benfica they will set up a repeat of their hugely controversial 2009 semi-final. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBack then, notorious ref Tom Henning Ovrebo caused a storm as he turned down four decent penalty shouts for the West Londoners before Andres Iniesta’s sensational last-minute strike saw the Catalan giants through on away goals. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe good news for Chelsea? Messi has never scored against them. The bad news? He will be desperate to change that stat in another record-breaking season. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThere was some refereeing controversy last night too, though nowhere near the same scale as Ovrebo. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAfter 11 minutes, Dutch ref Bjorn Kuipers gave a stonewall penalty as Luca Antonini upended Messi. The Argentina ace put it away with ease. Barca dominated and wasted chances but Milan stuck at it and, as long as it stayed 1-0, they were in with a shout. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAntonio Nocerino’s 32nd-minute leveller was not in the script — but after the goalless first leg, his strike meant the Italians took the advantage by virtue of their away goal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAn upset looked on the cards — but four minutes before the interval Kuipers pointed to the spot again. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOK, it was a penalty by the letter of the law as Alessandro Nesta pulled Sergio Busquets as Isaac Cuenca whipped in a corner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut the big question former Chelsea boss and chief Barca-basher Jose Mourinho is likely to ask this morning is simple: How many other teams would have been given a penalty in a similar situation? It was one of those that happens by the dozen in every high-level football match. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMessi struck the kick coolly into the opposite corner to his first to restore the lead. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri said: “We gifted them the first penalty but with the second the ref gave them some help. The second penalty was awarded very easily. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“Without that, the game could have been made complicated for Barcelona.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nGuardiola hit back insisting the ref was right and pointed to Barcelona’s 21 shots. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Barca boss said: “Both were penalties. I’ve seen them on TV. If there is a penalty, the ref must give it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n“We had 21 shots, against an Italian team of the quality of Milan — not three or four.”\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMilan did not have a single shot in the second half. But the visitors DID have a valid penalty shout when Daniel Alves brought down Robinho. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nKuipers waved it away and, after 53 minutes, Iniesta added the killer blow — just as he did at Chelsea in 2009. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\na.kastrinakis@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"YOU CESCY THING ...

To lose six out of seven in the league is something the club won’t tolerate, we can’t tolerate.\n</p>\n<p>\n“To have picked up just eight points out of 36 since the turn of the year is shambolic — relegation form.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n“The fact that this is the worst run in the league since 1953 speaks volumes. The eyes of the world are on Liverpool FC and the critics are having a field day. We’re becoming a laughing stock.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We’re all proud to be associated with the club and everything it has achieved over the years. But at the moment being a fan is just embarrassing and that’s something I haven’t had to say before.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAldridge went to Anfield in 1987, snapped up from Oxford by current Kop boss Kenny Dalglish to replace Juventus-bound Ian Rush.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe spearheaded a line-up which included Peter Beardsley and John Barnes, and lifted two league titles and an FA Cup, before heading for Real Sociedad.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Liverpool of today could hardly be more removed from the one of his day, which went on a then record unbeaten start of 29 games and lifted the title at a canter.\n</p>\n<p>\nAldridge, 53, said: “You can blame the manager and the coaching staff but it comes down to the players.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Some of them should take a look in the mirror.They are playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We know we’re not the finished article but we’re better than what we’ve seen recently.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The team just seems to have lost belief. They need to get back to playing for each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n“We’ve talked about good performances not getting the rewards they deserved, but it’s time for all those excuses to be thrown out of the window.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Liverpool FC fans are going to work distraught and seeing the team struggle like they did at Newcastle hurts a lot.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Reds have proved they can still match the big guns in a one-off — as they proved by knocking both Manchester clubs out of the domestic cups.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Carling Cup is in safe keeping, and on Saturday week they have a Wembley showdown with Everton as they gun for a place in the FA Cup final.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut they will have to do it without keeper Pepe Reina, banned for three games after his dismissal at Newcastle, and with players’ confidence on the slide.\n</p>\n<p>\nAldo added: “When you are in a rut it’s hard to get out of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“As a manager sometimes you have to do something different just to try to get a response. When I was at Tranmere occasionally I’d take all the lads for a Chinese or a few beers.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Something needs to be done to spark a reaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n“More than anything I want to see some pride. That’s all we’re playing for in the league now.\n</p>\n<p>\n“The target has to be to make sure the Blues don’t finish above us.\n</p>\n<p>\n“They have turned their season around and now we need to see our players follow suit.”\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"KENNY DO IT ...

He was on his serene, almost stealthy way. </p>\n<p>\nAnderson’s third wicket came when left-handed opener Lahiru Thirimanne padded up and was plumb lbw. </p>\n<p>\nSteven Finn, playing instead of the injured Stuart Broad, was full of praise for his new-ball partner. </p>\n<p>\nFinn, 23 today, said: “I’ve learned a lot from Jimmy, especially over the last 12 months. </p>\n<p>\n“He is an exceptional fast bowler who knows how to extract the maximum movement, nip and swing in any conditions. </p>\n<p>\n“To have him talking to me at mid-on or mid-off when I’m walking back to my mark and helping get my mind right is definitely a big help. </p>\n<p>\n“As a young player, I can learn from him about taking wickets. </p>\n<p>\n“He is so patient, he doesn’t go searching for those wickets. He is as consistent as possible. </p>\n<p>\n“Jayawardene played very well and assessed the conditions excellently. But he didn’t take the game away from us, even though he scored a century.”\n</p>\n<p>\nJayawardene offered a half-chance to Alastair Cook at short leg off Graeme Swann on 34. </p>\n<p>\nAnd, on 79, he edged Anderson between wicketkeeper Matt Prior and Strauss. Otherwise, his innings was error-free. In fact, he offered fewer chances than during his 180 in Galle, although he did not produce quite as much dazzling strokeplay. </p>\n<p>\nIn 11 home Tests against England, Jayawardene has scored six centuries and averages 90.66. </p>\n<p>\nThey are remarkable figures. </p>\n<p>\nJayawardene put on 124 for the fourth wicket in 44 overs with Thilan Samaraweera, who accumulated in his own unhurried way — although he was shaken up when struck on the helmet by Finn. </p>\n<p>\nSamaraweera also survived a DRS verdict by third umpire Rod Tucker, even though England’s fielders believed he should have been given out caught by Cook at short leg off Finn. Samaraweera was leg before to Tim Bresnan — chosen ahead of Monty Panesar — and Jayawardene was finally out lbw to Swann. </p>\n<p>\nHe reviewed the decision but the replay showed sharp turn for Swann from around the wicket and umpire Asad Rauf’s verdict was vindicated. </p>\n<p>\nEngland collected one more wicket before the close when Finn coaxed an edge from Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene to Prior. </p>\n<p>\nSamaraweera said: “Mahela is very calm. We have played a lot of cricket together and I can tell he is in tremendous form. </p>\n<p>\n“He is a great player and gave good advice to me.”\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"BOWLED OVER ... pace hero James Anderson celebrates after snaring Lahiru Thirimanne lbw","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/jimmy_1483874a.jpg"},{"caption":"HE'S TON IT AGAIN ...

A time of 1:42.862 put me fifth on the grid for Race one.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I got off to a great start, passing Spanish youngster Pepe Oriola on the opening lap to take fourth.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a really tightly contested race. I had one eye on Tom Coronel’s BMW ahead but was also very wary of my charging team-mate Alain behind.\n</p>\n<p>\nI ended up finishing fourth, by no means a bad result, with Alain 0.268s back.\n</p>\n<p>\nRace two was just as close, Russian racer Aleksei Dudukalo stalled from third on the grid and a bunch of us had to take evasive action.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the aftermath I was down to sixth and again in the middle of a bumper-to-bumper bunch.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had to watch out for Yvan behind me. He’s always a tough nut to crack and is not the reigning WTCC champion for nothing, but I held him off and took sixth at the flag.\n</p>\n<p>\nObviously the start to this year has not been as strong as my form in the first two race weekends last year, when I won twice.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut that just goes to show what I mean about the tough nature of this year’s series.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn a positive note, my run of consecutive points finishes now stands at 35. I’ve also finished my last 46 races, stretching back almost two years.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next race weekend in Marrakech is firmly on my radar for my first win of 2012. I’m in no doubt it’ll be just as tough out there and maybe some drivers will go loco in Morocco.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut if I stay out of trouble, I’m hoping to tell you about a triumph or two next time around.\n</p>\n<p>\nTalk to you then.\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"STRUGGLING TO SIXTH ... but at least Huffy's team-mate Yvan Muller is behind, so not all is lost","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01484/huffy76_1484150a.jpg"}]},"_id":"4f7c72f9e484648a78000078"}]}
