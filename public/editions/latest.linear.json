It is managed by a team of staff including his housekeeper, who was present at the time. </p>\n<p>\nSources believe the woman is an \"over-zealous fan\" Â— and said the incident would upset Cowell, who is known for greeting the public. </p>\n<p>\nAn insider said: \"Simon is one of the biggest stars in the world but he is very much a people person and doesn't walk around surrounded by big, burly bodyguards. </p>\n<p>\n\"He makes a point of shaking hands and speaking to people when he's going about his business. This is bound to make him more wary about being so open with strangers.\" It is not the first time Cowell has suffered a security scare. </p>\n<p>\nHe \"freaked out\" after finding a tracking device under his &#163;140,000 Bentley in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nCowell became suspicious after a mysterious biker began following him.

The passengers were collapsing all over the deck and being sick but I wasn't. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then the captain made the announcement, 'Do not worry. There hasn't been a tragedy at sea since the Titanic went down in 1912'. </p>\n<p>\n\"It wasn't true, of course, or heartening for us passengers. But yet again, the spectre of the Titanic had been raised.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin, his brothers and their parents were almost killed at sea themselves when, in 1967 on the way back from Australia, their ship travelled through the Suez Canal. </p>\n<p>\nHe recalls: \"A civil war was going on in Aden and our boat was fired upon. We were all ordered off the deck and into our cabins. It was quite exciting at the time but we could have all been killed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat same year Robin narrowly missed losing his life again, when he and his then wife-to-be, Molly, were involved in the Hither Green rail disaster, in south London, in which 49 people died. He says: \"I felt on top of the world that morning as the Bee Gees had just had a big hit with Massachusetts. Looking back, Massachusetts probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"Until that record hit the Top Ten I would never have been able to afford a First Class train ticket. But on that occasion, because Massachusetts was doing so well, I did. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And like everyone else travelling First Class that day, both Molly and I had more chance of surviving the crash than those who weren't. </p>\n<p>\n\"But though we did survive, I saw harrowing things I've never forgotten. </p>\n<p>\n\"Headless bodies being dragged out of the train wreck, people screaming. </p>\n<p>\n\"Molly and I were rushed to hospital in Lewisham so we could be examined for injuries. I had broken glass from the train windows tangled in my hair. </p>\n<p>\n\"It took days to remove it but that was really the least of it. The shock and the horror was far, far worse. When we got to the hospital it looked like a war zone. All around us people were being carried in on stretchers and some of their injuries were horrific. Suddenly, it all became too much for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"The worst thing of all was that I was unable to help anyone, to mitigate their suffering, I couldn't cope with that. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I knew I had to get away from all the carnage so I checked out of the hospital and instead went to stay with the Bee Gees' manager, Robert Stigwood. </p>\n<p>\n<b>\"After that I suffered a delayed reaction. For days and days I couldn't stop crying. In the end the only thing which saved me was my music, composing with my brothers and singing again.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But although I did recover, I'll never really forget the horror of the Hither Green train crash and the tragedy of all those poor souls who died or were injured in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin makes it clear that he does not think living through the rail disaster qualifies him for understanding the Titanic tragedy more than others. However, he believes it is easier for him to walk in the shoes of the doomed Titanic passengers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs an avid collector of Titanic memorabilia, he has always been obsessed by the tragedy. </p>\n<p>\nHis collection includes a pen fashioned from pieces of the wreckage. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a present from second wife Dwina, who also gave one to RJ. </p>\n<p>\nAnd that led him to change tack from composing pop music and, with RJ Â— also a talented musician Â— embark on composing his first classical work. </p>\n<p>\nRobin adds: \"It has taken us two years to complete The Titanic Requiem. </p>\n<p>\n\"Two years of dedication, and I'm definitely very proud of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRJ is also proud of the composition, and equally proud of his father's courage in working day and night on it while undergoing chemotherapy to combat his cancer. </p>\n<p>\nRJ says: \"He kept going on against all odds. He has been every inch a professional and he deserves a medal for it. For him to come straight out of chemotherapy and into the studio is incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"We've always been close but working on a piece of music that is meant to last for hundreds of years brought us even closer. </p>\n<p>\n<b>\"We composed the requiem in order to honour the memory of those who died and to celebrate the age in which they lived.\"</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin adds: \"I never pushed RJ to become a musician, though. I wanted him to excel at whatever he wanted to do but I never pressured him. </p>\n<p>\n\"As he grew older it turned out that he had a flare for melody, and like me and my brothers, who never had music lessons, he flourished. Our collaboration has been wonderful. We have already started working on our next joint classical composition, The First World War Requiem. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But neither of us will be giving up pop music, either. RJ will be recording an album, Instant Love, and I will be working with Barry again, I'm looking forward to it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I just hope that The Titanic Requiem will be a fitting memorial for all those brave souls who died during the tragedy, so they will never be forgotten.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the most moving elements in the requiem is the song Don't Cry Alone, which Robin sings. It tells of a man who knows he is going to die begging his wife not to cry alone when he's gone. </p>\n<p>\nIt is a song that Dwina finds particularly emotional. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"When Robin first played me the song he was in the middle of chemotherapy. I cried when I heard it. It brought up all my fears that I might lose him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Robin jokes: \"I was afraid that I might lose me, too. Luckily, I was wrong... \"</i>\n</p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>The Titanic Requiem is released as an album tomorrow and will be performed in concert at Central Hall in London's Westminster on April 11.

Damn, I'll just dye my hair'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe actress had to endure months of gruelling training to get in shape for the role. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It was intense. I had training about three times a day for a few months. Then, once we started working, I had to have the training just for endurance because it was so many hours. </p>\n<p>\n\"I mean, if there's a scene of me running up a mountain, that's what we shot all day Â– me running up a mountain. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had about six weeks of archery. It was brand new to me and I loved it. I think I'm good at shooting arrows now Â— and I can skin a squirrel!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe action was so intense that the star, who is dating British actor Nicholas Hoult, 22, had a constant battle to keep weight on. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It was great to lose weight because it was unintentional. I didn't go to the gym once. It was just a really physical movie. </p>\n<p>\n\"I actually ate more on that movie than I ever have on any other because it was non-stop and physical and I needed energy. </p>\n<p>\n\"It happened very naturally with all the training. It was hard to keep weight on for continuity. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I ate a ton. Any picture you see of me from that set, I'm probably eating.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer jumped at the chance to play the lead role. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I loved the books. That was the hardest part for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I almost wished I didn't love them as much as I did because of just the pressure I put on myself to make sure it was something I could be happy about and proud of. </p>\n<p>\n\"Katniss is such an iconic character and there is so much pressure just coming from myself because I was a fan.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe movie, based on Suzanne Collins' novels, is set in a future North America destroyed by drought, fire, famine and war. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEach year inhabitants are forced to take part in a televised fight to the death. </p>\n<p>\nJennifer said: \"I think it makes us look at humanity in kind of a real way, where it is is becoming desensitised. </p>\n<p>\n\"We can watch the demise of a marriage or we can watch death on television and it's entertainment. </p>\n<p>\n\"We're a society that's obsessed with reality. We're obsessed with gossip and bad things happening rather than good stories and good, uplifting things. We live in a world where history repeats itself and it's <i>(the events of the movie)</i> really not that far off, I don't think.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer is quickly rising up the ranks in Hollywood thanks to the new movie on top of past success. She was nominated for an Oscar last year for her role in thriller Winter's Bone Â— but she says she does not feel like a star. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The glamorous part lasts for about five minutes and it doesn't even really feel glamorous. So it just feels like a job. Being on a set is not glamorous. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I don't really think about it because I don't really like going out that much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm kind of a home body, so I was stressing out one time about movies and that I won't be able to go out to dinner Â— I won't be able to go to a bar and just hang out. </p>\n<p>\n\"But then I'm always lying to get out of those things anyway.

Kelley. </b></p>\n<p>\n<b>Michelle, 53, who co-stars with Johnny Depp in upcoming film Dark Shadows, is also known for her work with charities helping cancer patients. Here, she tells GARTH PEARCE what she wished she knew aged 18. </b></p>\n<p>\n\"I WISH I had known at 18 the importance of education. </p>\n<p>\nI was always at the beach. I couldn't wait to get out of school. I was so bored. </p>\n<p>\nI was a California girl to a T, being brought up in Midway City between Los Angeles and San Diego. </p>\n<p>\nI was not a good girl and always in trouble for something or other. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back, I wish I had paid more attention Â— and I also regret that I did not have teachers who were more interested in me. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I became a mother, I realised I had not taken enough advantage of my education and came to appreciate how important it really is. </p>\n<p>\nThat is completely different to having success. </p>\n<p>\nThere are people who have had no education who have made a lot of their lives. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are not careful, education can just slip by and it is sometimes hard to get a second chance. </p>\n<p>\nI'd also taken up acting at school because I was so bad at English and thought I would improve by taking theatre studies. But becoming an actress was as unobtainable as going to the moon Â— or becoming president. </p>\n<p>\nI had worked, part-time, as a check-out girl in a supermarket since the age of 14 and, in the end, I left school at 17 and worked there full-time. I had not learned a thing. </p>\n<p>\nI was living with my parents at home, working the check-out, spending time on the beach and realised I'd better do something with my life. I called a friend of mine, Walter Deadman, who was a hairdresser, who had always been harping on at me to model. </p>\n<p>\nI told him I would like to become an actress. </p>\n<p>\nInstead of laughing, he suggested I join a beauty pageant. I called up a modelling agent, John Robert Powers, who ran a sort of charm school. </p>\n<p>\nI borrowed a dress Â— I never wore them because they used to call me chicken legs at high school Â— and went along for some test shots. I used those to put myself up for the pageant. </p>\n<p>\nSo I went to LA for the first time in my life for the pageant. The biggest stress was that I smoked and I'd have to give it up for a week! I won a prize, because they suddenly decided they wanted a Miss Orange County. In truth, they had more crowns than people. </p>\n<p>\nBut winning that pageant did change my life. I moved out of my parents' house to about half a mile down the road and about six months later signed with an agent. </p>\n<p>\nI got a TV series and did not have to work at the supermarket any more. After that, what happened to me felt very dreamlike Â— a Disneyland experience, which changed me. </p>\n<p>\nBut I also wish I'd have known how being recognised would bother me far more than it should. </p>\n<p>\nI found it disturbing and completely unnatural. There is nothing to prepare you. </p>\n<p>\nI wish I could have handled it better, initially. </p>\n<p>\nI have learned since that it is possible to have both a home life and a working life. The worst moment was when there was a radio report, in the late 1990s, that David had left me for Ally McBeal actress Calista Flockhart Â— and we were both listening in the car, with the kids! </p>\n<p>\nThey gave an on-air apology the next day and I have never heard a more grovelling retraction. But it is hard dealing with that kind of stuff. </p>\n<p>\nI also struggled with my own image as a sexual person. </p>\n<p>\nThat ended with a film, The Fabulous Baker Boys in 1989, by which time I was 31. </p>\n<p>\nEven two years before that, I would not have been able to play the part of the sexually appealing Susie Diamond. She was dynamic and unapologetic and I was able to put on those clothes and play the part. I think, because of the way I looked, I had stayed away from buying anything sexy or overtly sexual. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a turning point for me, because I could understand why men would find her sexy. </p>\n<p>\nI wish I'd been more like her. Before that, I would walk around looking like a bag lady! </p>\n<p>\nBut the biggest turning point in my life was becoming a mother. If you had told me when I was 18 that I could survive on three hours' sleep a night, I'd have never believed it. You just cope. </p>\n<p>\nI would not choose a showbusiness career for my children. </p>\n<p>\nI would say: 'Be a doctor, or something else'. The value of a good education has never left me.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4198283/Johnny-Depp-news-Actor-plays-vampire-in-new-Tim-Burton-film-Dark-Shadows.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Darkest Depps"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4126962/Bryan-Adams-Valentines-Day-mash-up.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Bryan Adams Valentine's Day mash-up"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4076093/Johnny-Depp-news-Actor-sports-another-pale-face-in-Tim-Burton-movie-Dark-Shadows.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Johnny looks Deppart"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4059894/Johnny-Depp-news-Stars-face-changed-for-Tim-Burton-vampire-movie-Dark-Shadows-with-Michell-Pfeiffer.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Johnny is Depp in the Dark Shadows"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNF26MICH--532o_1477786a.jpg","caption":"Regrets ...

Damn, I'll just dye my hair'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe actress had to endure months of gruelling training to get in shape for the role. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It was intense. I had training about three times a day for a few months. Then, once we started working, I had to have the training just for endurance because it was so many hours. </p>\n<p>\n\"I mean, if there's a scene of me running up a mountain, that's what we shot all day Â– me running up a mountain. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had about six weeks of archery. It was brand new to me and I loved it. I think I'm good at shooting arrows now Â— and I can skin a squirrel!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe action was so intense that the star, who is dating British actor Nicholas Hoult, 22, had a constant battle to keep weight on. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It was great to lose weight because it was unintentional. I didn't go to the gym once. It was just a really physical movie. </p>\n<p>\n\"I actually ate more on that movie than I ever have on any other because it was non-stop and physical and I needed energy. </p>\n<p>\n\"It happened very naturally with all the training. It was hard to keep weight on for continuity. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I ate a ton. Any picture you see of me from that set, I'm probably eating.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer jumped at the chance to play the lead role. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I loved the books. That was the hardest part for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I almost wished I didn't love them as much as I did because of just the pressure I put on myself to make sure it was something I could be happy about and proud of. </p>\n<p>\n\"Katniss is such an iconic character and there is so much pressure just coming from myself because I was a fan.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe movie, based on Suzanne Collins' novels, is set in a future North America destroyed by drought, fire, famine and war. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEach year inhabitants are forced to take part in a televised fight to the death. </p>\n<p>\nJennifer said: \"I think it makes us look at humanity in kind of a real way, where it is is becoming desensitised. </p>\n<p>\n\"We can watch the demise of a marriage or we can watch death on television and it's entertainment. </p>\n<p>\n\"We're a society that's obsessed with reality. We're obsessed with gossip and bad things happening rather than good stories and good, uplifting things. We live in a world where history repeats itself and it's <i>(the events of the movie)</i> really not that far off, I don't think.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer is quickly rising up the ranks in Hollywood thanks to the new movie on top of past success. She was nominated for an Oscar last year for her role in thriller Winter's Bone Â— but she says she does not feel like a star. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The glamorous part lasts for about five minutes and it doesn't even really feel glamorous. So it just feels like a job. Being on a set is not glamorous. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I don't really think about it because I don't really like going out that much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm kind of a home body, so I was stressing out one time about movies and that I won't be able to go out to dinner Â— I won't be able to go to a bar and just hang out. </p>\n<p>\n\"But then I'm always lying to get out of those things anyway. So now I just have an excuse Â— 'I can't go, I'm famous'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I guess I feel I have to be more mature. I can't really, like, moon the paparazzi or anything, which is always my dream.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer, who auditioned for the part of Bella in Twilight, was also in X-Men: First Class last year. But she doesn't want to fall into Hollywood's traps. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"It is so strange to see in Hollywood how skinny these women are and how that puts pressure on our young girls. </p>\n<p>\n\"I remember being in school when I was 14 and girls were on diets and eating salads with dressing on the side.

All of a sudden I could see myself in a gorgeous white dress, walking down the aisle with all my friends and family looking on proudly. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In that moment I decided I had to get married and started planning straight away. I wanted to put my name on the wedding waiting list there and then.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin minutes of returning home, Rearna decided both her dad Des, 54, and brother Landon, 19, would walk her down the aisle to the song A Case Of You by James Blake. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It's such a beautiful song, when I heard it on the radio I instantly said 'That's it'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEver since her visit to the church ten months ago, Rearna is \"like a woman possessed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite her friends mocking her sudden obsession with her fantasy wedding, Rearna hasn't stopped giving them details of her big day. </p>\n<p>\nShe admitted: \"My friends laugh at me. They couldn't understand when I first told them I'd started to plan a wedding without a boyfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"Suddenly, bridal shops and wedding magazines became interesting. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking through them for ideas, my mind raced with thoughts of invites, flowers and, of course, the dress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna was in Uckfield, East Sussex, for a day when she saw an ivory dress on a mannequin in the window of Fross Wedding Collections. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I stopped in my tracks. I'd seen dresses I liked in the magazines but nothing compared to this. </p>\n<p>\n\"I knew straight away it was the dress I was going to get married in and booked an appointment for later that day to try it on. </p>\n<p>\n\"My friend Leah Butson Â— she's a student too Â— and I both had tears in our eyes as I twirled in front of the mirror with the circular train trailing behind me. It was the stuff of dreams.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nReturning home that night, unable to stop thinking about her dream dress, Rearna began to panic that the dress would sell out before she had the funds to buy it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I just know how upset I'll be if I finally saved up the money only to find out it's gone. The only way is to put down a deposit of &#163;150, so I'm going to have to save so I can be safe in the knowledge it's mine. </p><p>\n\"I go in to try it on at least once a month and because I've been doing it for the past seven months shop owner knows me by name. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've even considered taking out a loan to cover the &#163;1,100 to put my mind at rest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna now visits the church every month to visualise her big day and measure up to work out how many flowers she will need. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I sit and picture how it will look. I've planned to have the whole interior lit up with a thousand tea light candles and the pews to be draped with off-white silk. I love animals, so I've asked my best friend if her dogs can be involved. They're going to be dressed in little suits and dresses and will accompany the bridesmaids down the aisle. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My friend Kirsty Naunton makes amazing cakes so I instantly got her on the phone to discuss what I wanted. </p>\n<p>\n\"The chosen cake is three tiers with white icing and diamante-style decorations.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make sure her dream wedding will not become a distant fantasy, Rearna has made a pact with a close friend, 23-year-old Jonny Gregson, that if neither is married by the age of 30, they'll tie the knot. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Age 28 is my goal so I have a few years to find someone, finalise my plans and save the &#163;30,000 I need.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough she's missing a groom, Rearna couldn't wait to break the news to those who make up the rest of the bridal party. </p>\n<p>\nBest friends Olivia Jones, 21, Leah, 22, Kirsty Naunton, 22, and Lil Griffin, 21, will all be bridesmaids. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Although they think I'm mad, they're all excited. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have already taken them to the shop to show them the pink dresses they'll be wearing.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith the ceremony planned in fine detail, Rearna will be taking her guests to the nearby beach for the reception in a giant marquee. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Living in Brighton, I've decided to have a party on the beach. </p>\n<p>\n\"Watching the sun set with my family and friends and new husband will be so amazing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe single bride-to-be does not want to leave any part unplanned so Rearna has recently finalised her food menu. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"My grandma Daisy Ackord is Jamaican and she makes the best food I've ever tasted, so she's in charge of catering for my big day. I'm going to have a West Indian menu consisting of jerk chicken, specialty rice and peas, ackee and saltfish and special Jamaican cakes for dessert.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna and her gran have worked out the Caribbean feast will cost &#163;50 a head. And for the music, she will hire a jazz-funk band. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I come from a very musical family and we're all big jazz fans so I've been keeping an eye out for one that can cater for weddings.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery time someone mentions getting married, Rearna always tries to slip in a mention of St Bartholomew's. </p>\n<p>\nThe singleton even spoke to someone who had been married at the venue. When they revealed they had trouble with parking she immediately factored in plans to have minibuses bring guests to the venue. </p>\n<p>\nDespite living on her student loan, Rearna is already trying to save the &#163;30,000 she's worked out she needs for her big day. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The first thing I'm going to spend my first proper pay cheque on is my wedding dress. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm completely obsessed with it and can't wait to have it hung in my wardrobe instead of in a shop window.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Rearna is under no illusions Â— she knows the detail with which she has planned her big day could send a new boyfriend running a mile. </p>\n<p>\n<i>She said: \"When I do meet someone I'll be keeping these plans firmly under wraps Â— until I have a ring on my finger...\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4212557/I-halted-my-wedding-to-save-my-pet-lizard-from-cancer.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I halted my wedding to save pet lizard George"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/3716221/I-picked-the-reception-flowers-and-fiances-wedding-dress.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3784586/Dumped-on-my-wedding-day.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Dumped on my wedding day"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4185938/Big-Fat-Gypsy-Weddings-Cheyenne-shares-her-big-day-with-The-Sun.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"4 hairdressers, 10 bridesmaids and 1 smashed-up Rolls...inside the craziest gypsy wedding yet"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4166718/Wondering-how-our-leap-year-proposal-girls-got-on.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Wondering how our leap year proposal girls got on?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4184141/Big-Fat-Gypsy-Weddings-Gypsy-bride-Cheyennes-one-fingered-gesture-at-wedding.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"No, love ... ring goes on the other finger"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4127602/I-cant-wait-to-be-a-bridesmaid-at-gay-exs-wedding.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/3918082/I-struggled-to-get-down-on-one-knee-but-Sophies-worth-it.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I struggled to get down on one knee Â– but Sophie's worth it"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNF25WOMW-532_1477091a.jpg","caption":"Get me to the church ...

We saw his horrifically burned body and we cannot get that image out of our minds.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMedical student Mundill Mahil, 20, was jailed last month for six years for GBH with intent. Harvinder Shoker, also 20, got life for murder, while 20-year-old Darren Peters was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Amandip and her mum Tajinder have asked the Attorney General to review the sentence handed to Mahil and set up an e-petition, Justice For Gagandip. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking out for the first time, Amandip added: \"He would not have been murdered if Mundill Mahil hadn't lured him to her flat in Brighton in a carefully orchestrated honeytrap. </p>\n<p>\n\"Mahil will be released for good behaviour in three years. It's outrageous. Other cases involving money and fraud get much more punishment. Gagandip's life has been taken. I believe something more needs to be done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip's body was found in the burning car in Blackheath, south-east London, in February last year. </p>\n<p>\nHe had been violently attacked in Brighton before being driven back to the capital and murdered. </p>\n<p>\n<i>A post-mortem examination revealed he was still alive when the fire in the car was started.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the second tragedy for the family in just 18 months. In September 2009 Gagandip's father Charanjit was murdered in India. Eight people are on trial there accused of being involved. </p>\n<p>\nGagandip took over his dad's packaging firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"We were only just starting to come to terms with the first murder when Gagan was killed. It has knocked the life out of me and Mum.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard that Mahil, from Chatham, Kent, had been Gagandip's girlfriend. He was in love but they split up in August 2010 after she alleged he had sexually assaulted her. </p>\n<p>\nShoker, his friend of five years, also fell in love with Mahil and decided to take revenge on the businessman. </p>\n<p>\nIn February last year she lured Gagandip to her house in Brighton. </p>\n<p>\nShe knew that Shoker and Peters, both from London, would be lying in wait for him. </p>\n<p>\nHe was beaten unconscious and bundled into the boot of the car. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"I only met Mahil once, when Gagandip brought her to our home. She was very pretty and confident and seemed a nice person. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My brother and I were very close and were both living at home and saw each other every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"He became very close to her and said she was a friend he trusted and who he could talk to about anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Look at how she betrayed his trust. She tried to destroy my brother's character in court. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he was a kind, generous man who would have done anything to help anyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDetective Superintendent Damian Allain, who investigated the case, said after the conviction: \"Throughout the investigation and trial Mahil portrayed herself as a victim. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is clear to me, now endorsed by the jury's verdict, that her actions were calculating and that she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy with Shoker and Peters of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which resulted in his death.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family say Gagandip had the world at his feet. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"He ran the family's successful employment agency and packaging business. He also set up and headed Sikh TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"In addition, he was the founder of the British Sikh Student Federation. He had made friends and contacts all around the world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHis mother Tajinder, 45, was equally proud of his achievements. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"He had done so much. I didn't think a 21-year-old would be capable of so much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm amazed how much he achieved. Never a day goes by when we don't think about him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am devastated by my son's killing and struggling to cope. In my life there's only a dead end. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There's nothing left ahead. The whole story has finished here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe now runs the family business, which employs 300 people. But with the emotional turmoil of losing her son she found it almost impossible to carry on with it. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"When I first learned of Gagandip's death I was completely and utterly broken. </p>\n<p>\n\"I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on. I do not have the support of a husband because he also died not so long before Gagan. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I cannot describe on an average day my life since Gagandip's death because they have all blended into one. </p>\n<p>\n\"In the early stages I couldn't hold a conversation without breaking down in tears and there were occasions when the police had to call an ambulance for me after I collapsed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCherished pictures from the family photo album show what a loving son and brother Gagandip was. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a picture of him at his 21st birthday party with killer Shoker. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Shoker turned up uninvited to the party. </p>\n<p>\n\"We knew things weren't right between Gagandip and Shoker by that stage. The photo of them together is so ironic as they look like the best of friends Â— and for over five years they were. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sickened by the thought that the man who holds his hand lovingly over my brother's heart in the photo is the same person who later beat him so terribly then burned him alive. </p>\n<p>\n\"He spent so much time around at our house that he practically lived here. </p>\n<p>\n\"What he did is such a terrible betrayal of trust.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip was cremated and his ashes scattered in a river at the Kiratpur Sahib temple in the Punjab, India. </p>\n<p>\nLike her mother, Amandip broke down when she remembered the precious times they had together. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I found it hard to go into his bedroom without getting very upset.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, though, they remember him with the shrine in the garden and in his former bedroom in south east London. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Mum and I actually slept in his room as a way of trying to feel closer to him. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now we have turned his bedroom into a shrine, with a large photo of him on the bed and all his clothes and possessions are still in the room.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Gagandip's mum and sister are still clearly in pain over his loss Â— but their grief would be easier to bear if they felt justice had been done.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional reporting: MARK CHRISTY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3982615/Revenge-killing-of-TV-boss.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'Revenge killing' of TV boss"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3683937/Grieving-mum-in-battle-with-Turkish-cops.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Our son was drugged and murdered for Â£150 a few hours after this holiday snap... now we want justice"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF24hon5n---532_1476721a.jpg","caption":"Honeytrapper ...

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work Â— you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun Â— always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained Â— it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed Â— 'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one Â— man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

Sometimes they literally just faint. But occasionally, they have a cardiac arrest.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs one of a few doctors there when I joined the Lords 17 years ago, I was appalled how poor were the arrangements for these sudden, terrifying emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe attendant staff had often been trained in mouth-to-mouth and cardiac resuscitation, but there was no defibrillator anywhere in Parliament. This piece of kit is a life-saver.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen its electrodes are applied across the chest, its sudden pulse of high voltage electricity can jolt the heart back into a normal rhythmic beat. It's a clever device because its detector only allows an electric shock if the collapsed patient has had a cardiac arrest or a fatal change of heart rhythm.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it is safe and exceptionally easy to use by any layman with minimal training.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet when I tried to persuade the authorities in Parliament to obtain one of these portable machines (they are not expensive) officials in both Houses refused. Their excuses were shameful.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne official argued that we could not have a defibrillator as it would cause a problem if a tourist collapsed in the gallery Â— should we be obliged to offer resuscitation to a member of the public? It was suggested there might be legal consequences if it were used or not used. Four years later, an elderly peer collapsed right after speaking. There were no doctors present in the chamber and he died.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly then, reluctantly, was a defibrillator installed, and since then at least two lives have been saved. Cardiac arrest is extremely common yet it can be correctable. Clearly, it would help if everybody were trained in external cardiac massage, for example in schools. This knowledge would save some lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a clever defibrillator is a different matter. It is astonishing that so many public buildings do not have them readily available.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Those first few seconds after a cardiac emergency are critical and we must be prepared.\n</i></p>\n<p>\n<b>To sign The Sun-backed British Heart Foundation petition, click here</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4209790/Show-your-support-and-join-our-campaign-for-CPR-in-schools.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4210386/Medics-had-to-zap-Fabrice-Muamba-15-times.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4212641/Fabrice-Muambas-family-give-thanks-to-fans-as-star-recovers.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba's family give thanks to fans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4207991/Fabrice-Muamba-was-dead-for-78-minutes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba was 'dead' for 78 minutes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4205926/Fabrice-Muamba-asks-Did-we-lose.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba asks: Did we lose?"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF2428FX-532_1476788a.jpg","caption":"Race against time ... medics treat Muamba on the pitch and, inset, Lord Robert Winston"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H02NFX_1475388a.jpg"}]},"isArticle":true},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Counting the calories ...

Girls assume she is a porn star. Then there's the back pain. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Lots of women want big boobs but it's actually a total nightmare. </p>\n<p>\n\"The only men I attract are the sleazy type. It's rare that a guy looks me in the face when talking to me. </p>\n<p>\n\"Guys will flat-out stare and try all the cheesy chat-up lines. And a lot of the time they want their picture taken with them. Not me Â— <i>them</i>.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"Sometimes it can be a bit scary. A few blokes will try to get really hands-on. When I'm out with my male friends they'll usually circle round me. They're my bodyguards.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't fare much better with other girls. She says: \"Women assume my boobs are fake Â— they look at me like I'm a porn star. It's older women who always comment on them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They'll tut and shake their heads as they walk past me in the street. I can hear them saying, 'They're so fake', and, 'Look at her flaunting them'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I try to smile through it. I know they're real but sometimes it can be hurtful. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've developed a way of walking so my boobs bounce up and down and people can see they're real. It looks like I'm walking on the moon. </p>\n<p>\n\"Women can get quite jealous Â— that's probably why I have more male friends.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut meeting the right guy is difficult. Glasgow girl Stephanie says: \"I broke up with my ex in 2010. He couldn't handle all the attention I get and became insanely jealous. </p>\n<p>\n\"When we were out he'd get mad when other guys checked me out. I tried telling him it couldn't be helped Â— he knew what he was getting into.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie has seen a few men since the split but no one special has caught her eye. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They become too obsessed with my boobs, it's all they think about. It's hard to find a guy to see past them. </p>\n<p>\n\"A lot of blokes are just after me for the status of it, they see it as just another notch on the bedpost. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I want my boyfriend to see me for me, I'm more than just a pair of boobs. I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half Â— but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs Â— though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that Â— it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4127333/Model-with-38KKK-boobs-is-saved-by-airbags.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Model with 38KKK boobs is saved by airbags"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4192971/TOWIE-star-Lauren-Pope-I-just-wanted-my-ticking-timebomb-PIP-breast-implants-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I was terrified my PIP implants were a ticking timebomb.

She is now vice-chairman at West Ham. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Karren has two kids with hubby, former player Paul Peschisolido. </b></p>\n<p>\n<b>Here, in extracts from her inspiring new book, Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, Karren, 42, offers some hilarious anecdotes. </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI HAVE a desire for independence, the need for control Â– or what others call sheer bloody-mindedness. </p>\n<p>\nBut recently I've had to dwell on why I became who I am. I don't reflect on such things easily because I've never been an emotional person. I'm logic personified. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back over my life, I tried to work out how and where the desire for independence began to make itself felt. </p>\n<p>\nAmong my earliest memories was when I was three and my mum Rita and nan Nina left me at home one day with my grandfather, Gerald, while they went shopping. </p>\n<p>\nI remember my mum and dad, Terry, had this elegant drinks cabinet in the lounge. As a toddler I was fascinated by it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe door folded down and all these beautiful little glasses and different-coloured bottles glinted away in the backlight. </p>\n<p>\nI decided to get a chair, climb up and have a good look. Everything looked even better close up. </p>\n<p>\nThe dainty little glasses (for sherry), the perfect size for me, were so tempting that I started to fill them with the green, yellow and clear liquids I saw in the bottles Â— cr&#232;me de menthe, advocaat and vodka. </p>\n<p>\nTaking little sips and inviting my dolls to do the same, I was having a wonderful time Â– until my grandfather came into the room and asked what I was doing. </p>\n<p>\nOf course, as soon as he twigged, he told me to stop. Three-year-old me instantly replied: \"This is my house and I'll do as I want.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe left me to it. He was married to my grandmother, so perhaps he knew not to pick a losing fight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Not surprisingly, when my mum and nan got home I was rolling drunk and, by all accounts, not much more co-operative.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather got an earful, I was put to bed and the story passed into family lore. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs my nan used to tell me: \"You were such a little cow Â— and you know what? You weren't sick, not once. Not a drop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got that streak in you as a toddler, no one's ever going to be able to tell you what to do when you're fully grown. </p>\n<p>\n<i>It wasn't a one-off, either.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA few months later my mum took me to school for the very first time. </p>\n<p>\nPicking me up after my first day, she asked the teacher how I had got on. She had been worried, my mum admitted, because I was very shy. </p>\n<p>\n\"Which one is your daughter?\" the teacher asked. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady,\" said my mother. </p>\n<p>\n\"Karren Brady?\" was the incredulous response. \"Shy? She walked in, pulled a boy off his chair and said, 'That's my seat. Move.' I wouldn't be worried if I was you!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was advice my mother took to heart. In fact, that was probably the last time she worried about me. </p>\n<p>\nThere were other powerful influences in my childhood. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of my grandmothers were hard workers, strong women and very important in moulding me. </p>\n<p>\nI was very close to Nina, my mother's mother, in particular, who put an end to that alcoholic tea party when I was three. She was dynamite. She was Italian Â— from Naples Â— and incredibly feisty. She would have killed for her family Â— she wouldn't have thought twice about it. </p>\n<p>\nIf someone cut up my grandfather in traffic, she would get out of the car and punch them on the nose. </p>\n<p>\nI'm sure it won't come as any surprise when I say she was definitely the one in control of her house and marriage. </p>\n<p>\nShe was great with money Â— not because she had a lot but because she knew the price of everything and she was in charge. </p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather went out to work as a postman but she would take his wages and give him cash to spend. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThat was just the way it was. Grandma Nina really believed in me. Her attitude was: You can do it, so go out there and get on with it. </p>\n<p>\nEven if I get a bit feisty at home now, my husband will still say to me, \"Oh, Nina's here. Nina's coming out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>I was fiercely determined. If I wanted something and my parents wouldn't give it to me, I would find a way to get it for myself.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI was never given pocket money. My parents always offered to buy me what I wanted but I wanted to be in charge of my own money. </p>\n<p>\nI recall them once saying no to something Â— I can't remember what it was Â— but I haven't forgotten what I decided to do. I put up signs in my bedroom window Â— it was my bedroom so I could do what I liked, I reasoned Â— saying, \"Massages, manicures, come inside!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mother was shouting up: \"Who are all these weirdos coming to the door?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd I bawled back: \"They're my customers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI was bloody-minded too. I once put up a Vote Labour poster in my bedroom just because my parents were Conservatives. </p>\n<p>\nMy dad roared: \"Take that down!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI said: \"It's my bedroom!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"What does the poster even mean?\" And I didn't know, of course. I just knew it would wind him up and cause a debate. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 14, I'd tell my mum I was going to stay the night with my best friend, Charlotte, who would tell her mum she was staying at my house. </p>\n<p>\nAfter that we would meet up with our clothes in carrier bags, get changed, take the Tube into central London then go out in Soho. </p>\n<p>\nWhen everything closed we'd walk around until the Tube re-started in the early morning and go back to our borough Â— Enfield in north London. </p>\n<p>\nThen we walked around until 10am before we went home. </p>\n<p>\nMum would say, \"Well, you look very tired.\" But she never knew. Years later, when I told her, she was shocked. But I was even more shocked by what she said to me. </p>\n<p>\nShe looked at my daughter Sophie and said: \"What goes around, comes around.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nI went very cold and felt terrible about what I had done. </p>\n<p>\nBut at the time I couldn't have cared less. </p>\n<p>\nNothing was going to happen to me. I was in control, I was safe Â— or at least I thought I was. </p>\n<p>\n<i>But if I imagine my 15-year-old Sophie going out all night now, well...</i> </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nThe day I made a name for myself </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nMY school had lots of careers days and companies came in and talked to us, including advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the London radio station LBC. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nLots of people were interested but whereas everybody thought maybe they'd write to them, I got all the right details before the people left. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe next day I was on the phone making appointments. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBoth companies I was interested in offered me a job. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI chose Saatchi, leaving school on the Friday and starting work there the following Monday. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I was only 18, they put me on their graduate programme. I suppose they saw something in me. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThough I loved it, the programme was very rigid, so finally I got impatient and moved instead to LBC as a 19-year-old selling radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been given Asian Hour to sell, which was pretty tough Â– a 4am to 5am slot, the real graveyard shift. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI had been handed a list of companies that spent money on advertising but who didn't advertise on radio. One was Sport Newspapers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI got through to owner David Sullivan on the phone and he wasn't interested, saying \"radio didn't work\". </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI decided I would drop off some material at his office Â– persistence is everything Â– and once I was there I decided to wait to meet him in person. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI waited and waited and waited and in the end he agreed to see me because I had waited so long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI did a very quick pitch to him and he wasn't buying it at all, so I said: \"Look, if you take the advertising and sales don't go up, you don't have to pay for it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"That sounds good to me.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI didn't have the authority to do a deal like that, so it was a risk Â– but I remember thinking, \"Well, if it doesn't work out, what's the worst that can happen? They can fire me but I can always get another job. I'm only 19.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI still use that kind of thinking and I have done all my life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn fact, it's the foundation of my confidence and my ability to take risks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt worked out. Sales went up and, within months, Sullivan was spending more than &#163;2million a year on radio advertising. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI was managing it all and earning more commission than all the other sales staff put together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen he offered me a job, which I accepted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat episode is often considered to have been a turning point in my professional life but, in truth, I think my life had been heading that way since I was a young child. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Adapted by BEN JACKSON</b> <b>Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit And A Great Pair Of Heels, by Karren Brady, is published by HarperCollins on March 29, &#163;18.99.</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4184143/Karren-Bradysbr-football-diary.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4191942/The-Apprentice-unveiled-16-new-wannabes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Apprentice unveiled"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2614813/Karren-Brady-Im-hired.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Karren: I'm hired"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3877834/Apprentice-teens-top-the-adults.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Apprentice teens 'top the adults'"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf23bran1--532_1476008a.jpg","caption":"Driven ...

As far back as 1877 a statue of Venus de Milo was the subject of a court case when a gardener was caught trying to have sex with \"her\". </p>\n<p>\nMore recently, American Edward Smith has expressed his love for his VW Beetle, Vanilla, though he admits having \"relationships\" with many vehicles. </p>\n<p>\nHis most intense sexual experience was \"making love\" to a helicopter from the Eighties TV series Airwolf Â— but his major love is cars. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEdward said: \"I go a little bit beyond appreciating the beauty of a car, to the point of what I feel is an expression of love. </p>\n<p>\n\"I write poetry about cars, I sing to them and talk to them like a girlfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not sick. Cars are just my preference.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe told earlier this month how Leeds shop assistant Amanda Whittaker, 27, has fallen for the Statue of Liberty, or \"Libby\" as she knows her. At school she loved a drum kit. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1979, Eija-Riitta Ekl&#246;f from Sweden \"married\" the Berlin Wall. Eija, who changed her surname to Berliner-Mauer, coined the term Objectum Sexual (OS) for her unconventional orientation. </p>\n<p>\nMrs Berliner-Mauer says her \"long-distance\" relationship survived the \"tragedy\" of the wall being pulled down in 1989 Â— but she has fallen for a red fence. Former US soldier Erika LaBrie, 41, pledged to love, honour and obey the Eiffel Tower in an intimate ceremony in Paris in 2007. </p>\n<p>\nErika Eiffel founded the Objectum Sexuality Internationale group which has more than 40 members and a website. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOther \"inanimate lovers\" revealed by objectophiles include a cartoon character, steam locomotives, words, public buildings and a hydraulic flood barrier. </p>\n<p>\nSan Francisco sexologist Dr Amy Marsh carried out a scientific survey involving 21 objectophiles and found cars, trains and aircraft are the most common objects of desire. </p>\n<p>\nBut more women than men are objectophiles and they are more likely to love structures. </p>\n<p>\nDr Marsh said: \"OS transcends fetishism and is experienced as a sexual and/ or affectionate orientation with an array of emotions. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It does not seem to be caused by trauma or delusional psychiatric conditions, though it does seem linked with autism. </p>\n<p>\n\"Professionals need to learn more about OS and treat OS patients with the same respect they do for other sexual preference minorities.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information go to dramymarshsexologist.com</a>. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nm.phillips@the-sun.co.uk </a> </a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4210058/Im-in-love-with-3ft-statue-of-Adonis.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I'm in love with 3ft statue of Adonis"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/snf2322gn-5323_1476064a.jpg","caption":"Flight of fancy ...

I blamed the bad smells on the dog.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nConstantly banning herself from the food she loves has made Alison's adult life a misery. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My hatred of being big has meant I have spent every day on a dieting roller coaster. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm a fad diet junkie.

I battled to stay that size but the weight I'd lost on the 'Glandular Fever Diet' didn't stay off. </p>\n<p>\n\"As soon as the biscuit barrel was in sight, I piled on the weight.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison's obsession got worse when she found even quicker fixes. Within six months of turning 19, she had tried the Fit For Life Diet, the Egg And Grapefruit Diet and the Banana Diet. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I even tried the Lunch Box Diet. The idea is that you fill a lunch box up with lots of healthy food. That was great... until I started replacing the salad with chocolate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring her twenties, Alison's weight fluctuated between a healthy 9Â½st and 10st Â— but she longed to be a stone lighter again. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nA turning point in her dieting nightmare came when she married Frank, a photographer, now 48, in 1988 when she was 22. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I lost half a stone through a combination of nerves and WeightWatchers but, again, it didn't stay off. Within a year, I'd gone to almost 11st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison got desperate and started the meal replacement Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Within two months I was down to 8Â½st but, boy, it was hard. It was worth it though. I was slim and loving it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYo-yo dieting her way through the Eighties, Alison would spend hours researching gimmicks to keep herself below 10st Â— until she became pregnant for the first time in 1991. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I embraced eating for two and indulged in whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I looked massive. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was more than 14st when I gave birth to Charlie, who is now 20.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Afterwards, Alison got straight back into her fad diet cycle and spent a fortune on books and consultations to get back down to her beloved 9st. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she explains: \"Just as I hit the 10st mark, I found out I was pregnant with baby No2. </p>\n<p>\n\"Again, I ate for Britain. This time I was 13Â½st when I gave birth to Olivia in 1995.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce more, Alison threw herself into a host of different diets. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"You name it, I tried it. I'd feel motivated at the beginning and lose a few pounds but then I'd have a blip and pig out for a few days before embarking on another 'new' diet, telling myself this would be 'the one'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison did not manage to slim down before becoming pregnant again in 2000. </p>\n<p>\nThe cycle of gorging and dieting continued after daughter Florence was born in 2001, and Alison flitted between 11 and 12Â½st. </p>\n<p>\nTwo years ago, Alison's husband told her he was worried because her stomach was bigger than her bust. </p>\n<p>\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan had worked for her in the past and, amazingly, she lost three-and-a-half stone in just three months. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"At last I was 10st again. I stayed at that weight for six months by cutting out carbs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I looked great but missed bread and pasta.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut gradually the carbs slipped back on to her plate and Alison now admits: \"I'm back to 12st... oh all right, 12Â½st.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hate being this big but I can't face another liquid replacement diet Â— unless the liquid is Sauvignon Blanc. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Most of all, I'm sick of knowing that if I could just eat less and exercise more, my weight would naturally decrease. Perhaps then I would finally be happy.\"</i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nALISON'S DIETS </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n1. The Scarsdale </p>\n<p>\n2.

She could have had a knife, a gun or any other weapon.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is understood Cowell does not know the woman, and she is not believed to be one of the fans and hangers-on who gather outside his West London mansion. </p>\n<p>\nCowell is now stepping up security at his London base, where he stays when not at his other home in Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nHis London home, worth an estimated &#163;9 million, has a hi-tech security system. It is managed by a team of staff including his housekeeper, who was present at the time. </p>\n<p>\nSources believe the woman is an \"over-zealous fan\" Â— and said the incident would upset Cowell, who is known for greeting the public. </p>\n<p>\nAn insider said: \"Simon is one of the biggest stars in the world but he is very much a people person and doesn't walk around surrounded by big, burly bodyguards. </p>\n<p>\n\"He makes a point of shaking hands and speaking to people when he's going about his business. This is bound to make him more wary about being so open with strangers.\" It is not the first time Cowell has suffered a security scare. </p>\n<p>\nHe \"freaked out\" after finding a tracking device under his &#163;140,000 Bentley in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nCowell became suspicious after a mysterious biker began following him. A listening bug had earlier been found in the BGT studio. </p>\n<p>\n<b>- A WOMAN </b>of 29 was last night charged with aggravated burglary at Cowell's home, police said. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne Zaloumis, of Catford, South East London, was in custody last night and is due to appear at West London Magistrates' Court today. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nc.robertson@the-sun.co.uk</a> </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNN26COWZ---532_1477859a.jpg","caption":"Fright ...

Cowell has admitted he is a huge fan of hers. </p>\n<p>\nBut Londoner Jessie was the first big name to sign up as a coach on The Voice, the BBC's most hyped entertainment show in more than a decade. </p>\n<p>\nShe reckons it was an easy decision for her to join the show because the super-ambitious singer Â— who trained at <i>the</i> celebrity fast-track academy, London's Brit School Â— wanted people to see another side to her. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"It's very scary but very exciting. But you know what? I'm just excited because I get to see a different side of things and people get to see me in a completely different scenario. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not singing and it's not me doing a three-minute TV performance, so people get to see my personality and really see that I have a passion for what I do. That's what I'm most excited about, people getting to see that I am a bit silly, make jokes and get told off. </p>\n<p>\n\"But I'm also a hard worker and care about technique and the artist, and I get very emotional.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDiscussing her bisexuality, she says: \"I've been with guys and I've been with girls and I kind of think it's about the person, not the genitals.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe revealed earlier this month how tattooed Jessie has been enjoying secret dates with rapper Tinie Tempah Â— another ridiculously talented artist. </p>\n<p>\nJessie, who has endured teasing about her bisexuality Â— not least from her two older sisters who are married with kids Â— suffers from a hereditary heart defect which caused her skin to go GREEN when she was younger and earned her the nickname \"alien\". </p>\n<p>\nAnd at the Brit School, where she played in a girl band, she was struck down by a minor stroke just a few months before graduation, which forced her to drop out. </p>\n<p>\nSome say her health issues have helped to keep her grounded in an industry full of sharks and phonies. </p>\n<p>\nShe has enjoyed a string of hits Â— notably Price Tag and Do It Like A Dude Â— but believes she can connect with the The Voice's contestants because she still feels their fears about the fickle public. </p>\n<p>\nShe says of starting on the show: \"It's a very interesting vibe and I just found myself forgetting I was on TV. But I could understand what the contestants were going through, stepping on stage and wanting to get people's attention. It broke my heart. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's a weird situation because I'm still in that situation as a recording artist right now. I could put out my second album and no one could buy it. I desperately want people to buy it so know how that feels. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm very protective of my artists.But one thing I made clear at auditions is that they shouldn't feel defeated. You've just performed on a massive studio stage and got to sing in front of the whole of the UK. It's a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIronically, for someone whose unique look marks her out from the crowd, part of the reason Jessie wanted to do The Voice was that it is NOT about appearances Â— the panel sitting with their backs to the acts so they judge on only the voice. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"It's not about what the acts are wearing. Your look is not definitive. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's very important to try to look your best. I love getting dressed up and making an effort. All that is part of it, but it's also about you doing it for the right reasons. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's about knowing, when you're a singer, that you can wear the greatest outfit but, if you're not breathing right or holding the mic right, you're not going to perform well and be seen as the voice Â— you're going to be seen as the clothes. </p>\n<p>\n\"The thing that made me agree to get involved with The Voice is that it's about the one thing I'm all about Â— the voice.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe chemistry between Jessie and her fellow coaches Â— Tom Jones, Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am and The Script singer Danny O'Donoghue Â— made for entertaining viewing on Saturday, although the show lacked some of The X Factor's edge. </p>\n<p>\nBefore The Voice launched, the judges were sent on a a night out together to get to know each other Â— just the four of them, no flunkeys allowed. Jessie says: \"We went out for dinner. I'd flown in from Thailand that morning and was really tired. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was, like, 'This is the most surreal meal of my life. Tom Jones is asking what everyone wants as a appetiser.' I was, like, 'Oh-kay!'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"So I just started to talk, then I realised I really am like a big sponge that just soaks everything up, from being on the show to being around people like Tom. </p>\n<p>\n\"You feel like you've known him for years within five minutes. </p>\n<p>\n\"I remember him for Not Unusual and Sex Bomb but everyone knows who he is, even if you don't really know his music. He's just one of those names that's always been up there with, you know, UK talent. To hear him talking Â— 'Oh, when I was at Elvis Presley's house...

Whenever people do recognise me it means they are a proper fan. </p>\n<p>\n\"And they're always really nice. I can just go 'Bah' [a reference to the Facejacker art critic Brian Badonde] and they'll start laughing. </p>\n<p>\n\"Or they'll be a Four Lions fan and I'll go 'rubber dingy rapids'. </p>\n<p>\n\"Either way I'm a pretty low rent street entertainer!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's nice to know that those fans are genuine, though. Such is the cult status of his comedy show. </p>\n<p>\nHe adds: \"I would hate if it were an obscene and gratuitous, like how some celebrities get intruded upon. </p>\n<p>\n\"I can handle it as it is. A nice trickle of people just gently boosting my ego.\" </p>\n<p>\nHiding an ego behind a series of animated phone pranks must be tough though. For Kayvan's major break came through the TV series Fonejacker - where his identity was left hidden. </p>\n<p>\nWhich is why it was nice to make the move from 'Fone' to 'Face'. </p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"It was nice to break cover. Plus the fact that people liked my work before knowing what I looked like was helpful.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd when people do find out what Kayvan looks like, they can be pleasantly surprised. </p>\n<p>\nI put it to the funnyman that he is a hearthrob. </p>\n<p>\nEmbarrassed, he says: \"Well, it helps that I'm not deformed I suppose.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAside from Facejacking and popping up in films, Kayvan has starred in medical drama Sirens with Rhys Thomas (Star Stories) and Richard Madden (Game of Thrones). </p>\n<p>\nThe series is out on DVD now. But what is Kayvan's real-life experience of A&amp;E? </p>\n<p>\n\"Last time I went to A&amp;E was to visit my father, who became injured after being chased down the road by a tramp. </p>\n<p>\n\"The tramp that thought my dad was being rude to his dog. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is a lesson to be learned there - if a tramp thinks you're being rude to their dog, ignore them. </p>\n<p>\n\"Do not make eye contact with the tramp, or even refer to him as a tramp. </p>\n<p>\n\"If things become heated, offer the dog a treat. </p>\n<p>\n\"If that doesn't work, offer the treat to the tramp - and you'll be fine.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>- SERIES 1 of Sirens is available to buy on DVD now. Facejacker returns on 27 March on Channel 4. The Facejacker App is also available.

It took away a lot of confidence because I never knew where it would happen or who I would be with.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"On one occasion I was taking my son to nursery school, walking down a busy road and I had one.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thankfully there were no accidents.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy actor told how when he suffered a seizure on stage as a young man, he knew it could mean the end of his acting dream.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I'm told the cast covered for me and the audience didn't know. I suppose it looked like I had gone blank and started to do odd things. Once that happened, I realised that I couldn't continue on stage.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPhilip added: \"Now that I'm seizure-free you can't keep me away. I was in panto last year and in the West End, which is fantastic after all those years that the door was firmly closed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe confessed he hadn't always been open about the debilitating disorder during auditions.\n</p>\n<p>\nPhilip said: \"Once I was filming abroad, playing the part of a cockney Jewish army chauffeur and after I stepped off the plane and met the production crew, I had a seizure.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The producer asked why I hadn't declared it, I was supposed to be driving. I explained I thought I might not get the job. They had to find a way around it, to tow the vehicle. It also caused trouble when I trained to be a teacher.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey tried to get me out of the college because I had missed such a lot of work and time.\" Thankfully for his present pupils Â— he still works as a supply teacher in his spare time Â— he passed his exams.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he admits his TV work has meant some tricky moments in the classroom, adding: \"When I was doing a series called Band Of Gold I played a baddie who was a debt collector.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My comeuppance was being caught in bed with a rent boy by the police. The following day I was supply teaching at a secondary school.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You can imagine the shouts and jeers I got from the kids.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPhilip, who has two children, Rupert, 27 and Jodie, 23, with wife Pip, is adamant he has very different character traits to his Waterloo Road alter-ego.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I hope I'm nothing like Grantly as a teacher. He doesn't have much respect for the kids.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"People shout, 'Oi, Grantly' as I'm out and about. The other week I was in a restaurant and someone came over and said, 'My dog ate my homework, sir.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The most amazing thing about it is that they are mostly teenagers who seem keen to meet me, which is quite the opposite to what I expected.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSpeaking of his epilepsy, Philip added: \"It controlled my life.

Alesha I've been after her for a long time and David I've wanted on the show for two years.\" </p>\n<p>\nThe BBC has lavished &#163;22million on The Voice and Simon blasted them for refusing to admit they are in competition with his shows. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"They wanted to have a pop at BGT because it's too popular and they don't like The X Factor being as popular as it is.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he backed X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos to return Â— despite her sex tape shame. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I'm a hundred million per cent behind her.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the latest series begins it has emerged BGT sensation Jonathan Antoine, 17, was so badly bullied about his weight that he suffered a nervous breakdown in October. </p>\n<p>\nWhen the 20-stone teenager came on stage with friend Charlotte Jaconelli, 16, Simon could be heard whispering to guest judge Carmen Electra: \"Just when you thought it can't get any worse.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut as the pair performed Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's The Prayer, Jonathan's incredible opera voice won a standing ovation. </p>\n<p>\nOn last night's show Simon asked Jonathan if he would consider ditching pal Charlotte Â— but Jonathan valiantly refused. </p>\n<p>\nA spokesperson for mental health charity Mind welcomed the news BGT was supporting Jonathan Â— who is being monitored by a psychiatrist. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile Sam Kelly, 19, of Norfolk, wowed the BGT panel playing guitar and singing Adele's version of Make You Feel My Love.

Tulisa doesn't respect herself because of the way she was brought up Â— especially when it comes to men.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explained sadly: \"A young girl who respects herself would choose her partner very wisely. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is clearly not making the right partner choices. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is not seeking out a healthy relationship Â— a genuine and honourable man.\" </p>\n<p>\nMel grew close to Tulisa after her real mum Ann had a breakdown when she was just 11. </p>\n<p>\nShe fears her stepdaughter, 23, will struggle to live down the tape showing her performing a sex act on then-boyfriend Justin Edwards, 28 Â— a wannabe rap star who calls himself MC Ultra. </p>\n<p>\nMel went on to blast whoever left Tulisa squirming by posting the footage on the internet. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I know chances are Tulisa is the victim. But she needs to stop being so careless with herself and her career. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is so talented and has the chance to make it big. </p>\n<p>\n\"She can't afford for stuff to come out like this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe stepmum blamed Tulisa's broken home and her subsequent hunt for a father figure for landing herself in trouble. She said: </p>\n<p>\n\"She needs strong loving parental guidance. Unfortunately for Tulisa, her mum is not very well and she has got a father who is a distant character. </p>\n<p>\n\"I feel she is a victim of her childhood, Â— the classic little girl who wants her father's love. </p>\n<p>\n\"And that is because she's been desperately seeking the love and affection of men since she was a little girl. </p>\n<p>\n\"From what I can see Â— as someone who knows her from childhood Â— she is searching for someone just like her father. </p>\n<p>\n\"She needs to find someone kind, honourable and genuine. A man who comes from a proper family background and has family values.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel Â— now a housewife living in Hertfordshire Â— described the singer's relationship with her father Plato as stormy. She claimed this did not make for a happy childhood, saying: \"All Tulisa wanted was her father's love.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMel wed Plato in 1999 two years after they met. The couple had moved in together in Queen's Park, North West London. </p>\n<p>\nDescribing how Tulisa was sometimes a handful, Mel said: </p>\n<p>\n\"When she was young, her role models were Charlie's Angels and the Spice Girls. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were all about empowering yourself and girl power.

There is no doubt the league campaign has simply not been good enough Â— but the cups could provide salvation. </p>\n<p>\nThey desperately need the FA Cup to ensure that. If not what do you do, get rid of Dalglish? </p>\n<p>\nThe criticism some would have is that he has been out the game too long and lost touch. </p>\n<p>\nI have worked under him at both Blackburn and Newcastle and, believe me, this is a man who would not lose touch with the game if he was on the moon. </p>\n<p>\nHe studies it whether in it or out, if there is a park game going on around the corner he would watch. </p>\n<p>\nThis is not a man who has lost touch with football. </p>\n<p>\nAnd I doubt either he has lost the techniques that made little Blackburn take on the big boys and win the 1995 title. </p>\n<p>\nHe was a master at Blackburn, invoking a togetherness and desire to achieve unlike any I have known. </p>\n<p>\nI don't believe he has lost that ability. </p>\n<p>\nJust 13 months is no time to make a club like Liverpool great again. And yet a cup double this season and he will have taken some big steps on the road to achieving that. </p>\n<p>\nA long-term plan, after all, and success in whatever form it comes breeds confidence. </p>\n<p>\nLiverpool fans and the owner should keep faith. </p>\n<p>\nThe right man is still at the helm, he just needs more time. </p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nClassy Coyle </h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>\n<b>BOLTON and their manager Owen Coyle have come out of the last fortnight with enormous credit.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCoyle, his chairman, players and fans have all shown what a real football club they are. </p>\n<p>\nAnd not only in the way they have handled the tragic circumstances of Patrice Muamba's near-fatal heart attack. </p>\n<p>\nThey had to get back and play a football match too. Lesser men may have crumbled under the weight of emotion on Saturday, yet they used it as a powerful force to win. </p>\n<p>\nBolton stood up and put on an occasion and performance to be remembered as they beat fellow-strugglers Blackburn to give them new hope of staying up. </p>\n<p>\nAnd after everything that has happened, I sincerely hope they do. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nYou got off lightly Rob </h1>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>\n<b>I AM not sure what Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini had to moan about at Stoke.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nYes the Potters are physical, yes they get about you, and yes they ask you questions. You just have to find the answers. </p>\n<p>\nI don't think there was any intention in Dean Whitehead's challenge on David Silva that left him needing a bandage. </p>\n<p>\nBut I do believe Stoke should have had a penalty when Gareth Barry brought down Glenn Whelan. </p>\n<p>\nI can understand Mancini's frustration at failing to win but he should not be looking at Stoke when trying to find someone to blame. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4218531/Dan-Kings-Sport-Uncovered-Kenny-faces-new-Raf-ride.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Kenny faces new Raf ride"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4218554/Kenny-Dalglish-set-to-miss-out-on-Belgian-whizz-Dries-Mertens.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Kop plan Dries up"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4218982/Kenny-Dalglish-wont-throw-in-the-kids-at-Liverpool.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Kenny's kids put on hold"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/KennyDalglish_1477845a.jpg","caption":"HE KEN DO IT ...

Cech, 29, said: \"Liverpool had so many problems within the club, not really on the pitch, so that is why they lost some time. But this club has the structure.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I do believe that one season will make a difference, because it will slow down all the process of being a Champions League club and hunting for trophies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But it will not be the end of Chelsea because I believe that we will come back.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRoberto Di Matteo's side have the heaviest fixture list of any English team with their European matches and an FA Cup semi-final coming on top of the Premier League games.\n</p>\n<p>\nCech added: \"If we manage to get through to the semi-final of the Champions League, we will have a crazy calendar with a lot of games.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"With the FA Cup as well, it's good in a way because it means that you are in the hunt for trophies.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But in terms of the Premier League, we have put ourselves in a difficult position.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But there are 24 points still left and that is a lot of points to play for. In that period you could overcome a five-point deficit.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"You need to make sure that you win all your games or the majority of them and the other teams slip up.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Spurs was an opportunity missed for us. It was a head-to-head game and a chance to close the gap and we didn't do that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStriker Didier Drogba feels Chelsea have only themselves to blame for their predicament in the Premier League.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"If Spurs and Arsenal are above us, in these positions, it's because they deserve it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We haven't done anything to be above them, let's be honest. But there are still enough games to change this.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRight now, Drogba has his sights firmly fixed on Benfica.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he still feels inspired by the way the Blues overturned a 3-1 first-leg deficit to beat Napoli with that stirring second-leg performance.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 4-1 win, after extra-time, means Blues fans can dream of another stunning semi-final clash with Barcelona.\n</p>\n<p>\nDrogba said: \"Football! Football and Chelsea Â— that's what it was.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There are teams who you know can do it, whatever the challenge Â— even if they lost by five or six away.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There are a few teams that you know can do it in those situations and Chelsea is one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"With the players we have and the mentality we have here to fight Â— and fight until the last minute Â— we can do anything.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I believe that's why we've had these moments in so many seasons, because we all believe we can do it and when we do something, we do it as a team, as a group.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We have started to believe a bit more in ourselves and there is a little bit more confidence now.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only thing that can change a dressing room is winning games and going on a good run of results.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Even if you have the best atmosphere in the dressing room to begin with, when you lose games everyone will be down.

Newcastle swept from one end of the park to the other in no time at all. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFabricio Coloccini headed clear to Ben Arfa who played a one-two with Danny Guthrie before haring off into space. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAs Newcastle fanned out like the Red Arrows Â— well, tangerine arrows Â— Ben Arfa combined with Cisse, drove at Jonas Olsson and cut inside his man. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe Frenchman then curled a left-footer beyond Foster from the edge of the box. It was a sublime moment from the midfield 'artiste'.Yohan Cabaye then shot wide from 20 yards before Newcastle added a third on 34 minutes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAgain their movement was a joy to behold as Ben Arfa combined with Ba on the left. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNewcastle top scorer Ba drew in the Baggies defenders before producing a cute backheel to set Ben Arfa free on the wing. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe French ace centred again and Cisse retraced his footsteps to score for a second time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCisse then got to his knees, kissed the turf and said a prayer in thanks to a higher power. Yes, Ben Arfa was THAT good. To his credit, Hodgson did not hang about, bringing on Chris Brunt and Shane Long for Jerome Thomas and Keith Andrews at half-time. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNewcastle's change was enforced as Coloccini suffered a hamstring injury which will keep him out of the Liverpool game and probably several others. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut Toon almost went four up just four minutes after the break when Baggies centre-back Gareth McAuley failed to cut out a through ball and Cisse scampered clear. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFoster denied the Senegalese striker a hat-trick with a stunning block with his left arm. West Brom were throwing caution to the wind and it paid off when they pulled one back after 52 minutes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYoussouf Mulumbu's pass in behind the defence was chased down and Tim Krul and Mike Williamson got their wires crossed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe defender headed past his on-rushing keeper and sub Long nipped in to gratefully supply the easy finishing touch. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nKrul partly atoned for his error when he beat out Peter Odemwingie's stinging effort minutes later as the Baggies sweated in the sun. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut all the sunshine moments were coming from the visitors and Ben Arfa forced Foster into another save with a low shot which the keeper pushed away at full stretch. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCisse was seen leaving the field on a stretcher but the Toon Army will be pleased to know it was just a bit of cramp. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMorrison hobbled off with a knee injury to leave West Brom with just 10 men on the park. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe game was already gone Â— but for Newcastle, the season could just be hotting up. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN Â— HATEM BEN ARFA (NEWCASTLE)</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEST BROM:</b> Foster 7, Jones 5, McAuley 5, Olsson 5, Ridgewell 5, Morrison 6, Andrews 4 (Long 6), Mulumbu 5 (Scharner 5), Thomas 4 (Brunt 6), Odemwingie 5, Fortune 6.

This week Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas was also said to be in Dubai to discuss the sale of his club Â— or part of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nArab network Al Jazeera Â— part of the same group as PSG's owners Â— have bought the TV rights for Ligue 1.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo why all the fuss about France? Simple Â— it is much cheaper than the Premier League to buy clubs and to challenge for silverware, as well as attract top names.\n</p>\n<p>\nBefore buying PSG, Qatar Sports Investments looked at Manchester United but were put off by the <b>&#163;1BILLION</b> cost.\n</p>\n<p>\nPSG, a glamorous club based in the French capital, cost 'just' &#163;40m.\n</p>\n<p>\nA top source told me: \"In their first season at Paris, QSI invested &#163;80m to bring in stars like Javier Pastore. Paris are top of Ligue 1 and favourites for the title.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"City owner Sheikh Al Mansour has spent over &#163;1bn in transfers and wages. It took three years to win the FA Cup and get into the Champions League.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It took four years to challenge for the title and they still seem to be falling short.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It is much cheaper in France. Also if you pay so little compared to buying an English club, you have massive sums available for players and wages.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLille's Belgian superstar Eden Hazard tops the list of City's summer targets and only last week boss Roberto Mancini went to watch him against Valenciennes.\n</p>\n<p>\nBuying Lille would cost about as much as Hazard Â— between &#163;30m and &#163;40m.\n</p>\n<p>\nLille's new state-of-the-art stadium, which cost &#163;260m and holds 50,000, will open in the summer.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a public-private partnership and Lille, where England ace Cole is spending the season on loan from Liverpool, will pay an annual rent of &#163;6m for 31 years.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt will then be owed by the municipality but until then Lille will have full rights to maximize their profits from the venue.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis will make a takeover very attractive.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd with so much oil money being pumped into the French top flight, interest is sure to rise.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey will get the coverage in key markets from Al Jazeera.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe French could soon rival the Premier League and La Liga for the huge revenues from international TV rights and merchandising sales.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nHe's the Mess-iah\n</h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>LIONEL MESSI set a new scoring record for Barcelona on Saturday.</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHis goal in the 2-0 win at Mallorca meant he has 35 League goals for the season Â— one more than the club's previous best set by Brazil star Ronaldo under Sir Bobby Robson in 1996-7.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut Cristiano Ronaldo, 27, struck twice as Real Madrid thrashed Real Sociedad 5-1 to stay level with Messi at the top of this season's League scoring charts.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIn all competitions, Messi has 49 goals in this campaign with Ronaldo on 44.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMessi, 24, has lifted 18 trophies. Ronaldo has won 10. In 11 Clasicos since Ronaldo joined Madrid, Messi (above) has seven wins to Ronaldo's one.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut who is the greatest? Here is Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger's verdict: \"Messi is certainly the greatest for the moment. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"He has pace, ball control, speed of thought, efficiency and humility. It's rare that a player has such talent and it does not make him arrogant.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Cristiano Ronaldo is, I wouldn't say in the shadow of Messi, but he must in some way want to get in front of Messi. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"He has the potential to do it.

But he cannot stand the thought of Tevez spoiling the party. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"If Carlos plays against us, I'm sure he'll be motivated. He's an excellent player, able to change a match in an instant. What he did against Chelsea was no surprise. </p>\n<p>\n\"But for Tevez to score the winner? I hope it doesn't happen. </p>\n<p>\n\"And for us to fail and lose the title will bring pain for months. But I'm confident in my team. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"There's a lot of pride in Manchester that our two clubs are the best in England. </p>\n<p>\n\"But now we are focused on Fulham because our challenge is to win all our matches and to arrive with an advantage over City on derby day. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not saying whether that game will decide the title but it's clear the winners will deliver a morale blow to the other club. So I expect a big battle and for us to avenge our 6-1 defeat at Old Trafford.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nValencia, 26, is flying again after last season's horrific broken leg and further injury during the summer's Copa America with Ecuador. </p>\n<p>\nAnd recently he suffered a troublesome hamstring injury in the Europa League against Ajax. </p>\n<p>\nHis excellent performance at Wolves has boss Alex Ferguson purring and Fulham can expect the runaround at Old Trafford. </p>\n<p>\nFergie said: \"Antonio could be very important. His form before he got the injury was outstanding. Now he's back, we hope he stays fit. </p>\n<p>\n\"You get two sides to Antonio. He's prepared to work hard, he can tackle, run but he can also beat a man. He's got everything.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nValencia is determined to carry on where he left off and said: \"I'm happy to be back. Initially, I feared my latest injury would affect me but this time the situation wasn't so grave. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now I dream about helping the team, making the most of my chances. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not easy getting into the first XI at United. That was why I was angered about my last injury. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have been working with the physios to advance my recovery and now the key for me is to avoid more injury problems. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've a good sensation about the end of season personally Â— and for the team.

goes to Caterham","teaser":"INSIDE F1: TOM WEBB reveals there were a few surprises for Caterham in Malaysia, including a visit from film star Owen Wilson","timestamp":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 14:02:19 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>FOR anyone watching at home, the 2012 Malaysian Grand Prix must have been one of the great races.</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt had everything. </p>\n<p>\nThere was the complete range of weather conditions and drivers used every ounce of talent at their disposal just to keep the cars on track. </p>\n<p>\nThere were closely fought battles up and down the pecking order. </p>\n<p>\nFernando Alonso's God-given skills saw him drag a machine to victory when it probably did not deserve to finish in the top 10. </p>\n<p>\nAnd there was also a first Formula One top-three finish for Sergio Perez Â— the man who may well be Alonso's next team-mate at Ferrari. </p>\n<p>\nFor Caterham F1 Team it was also a dramatic race. </p>\n<p>\nWe had a two-car pitstop to put both cars on full wet tyres at the same time when the safety car came out. </p>\n<p>\nWe also had a change of nose for Heikki Kovalainen after he had an excursion off-track and hit a bollard. </p>\n<p>\nAnd Vitaly Petrov was fighting with a Ferrari, a McLaren and a Toro Rosso for much of the race. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAll of this was played out in the stifling heat that the Malaysian GP is renowned for. </p>\n<p>\nOn the team timetable in the garage the race team co-ordinator Graham Watson Â— Smudge to everyone who knows him Â— had written in large letters:<b> \"KEEP DRINKING WATER\"</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs if the boys in the garage needed any reminding. </p>\n<p>\nStaying hydrated is the key to being able to perform in an environment like Malaysia. </p>\n<p>\nIt is the hottest race of the year, along with Singapore, and it is the humidity that really hits hard. </p>\n<p>\nHeikki and Vitaly have a hydration plan that starts as soon as they arrive in Malaysia five days before the race. </p>\n<p>\nThey build up their intake of liquids over the week until race day when they can consume up to seven litres of water, electrolytes and sports drinks. </p>\n<p>\nThat helps them balance out the three to four kilograms of weight they will lose in the car in the longest race of the season. </p>\n<p>\nThe mechanics are obviously not under the same degree of physical stress as the drivers. </p>\n<p>\nBut having to don fireproof overalls three hours before the race on Sunday and working in a garage that reached 40Â°C in 2012, with humidity peaking at 84 per cent, puts a huge physical strain on already stressed capabilities. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite this testing environment everyone just gets on with it. </p>\n<p>\nThere is no time to worry about being soaked to the skin after the run back to the garage from the grid and the humour levels and positivity stay as high as ever. </p>\n<p>\nThe mood is always boosted when a famous face appears in the garage and this year it was Hollywood superstar Owen Wilson. </p>\n<p>\nHe caused a tangible ripple of excitement as he was shown around our garage by team principal Tony Fernandes just under an hour before the race was due to start. </p>\n<p>\nTony handed over to team manager Graham Watson to explain the detail of a 2012 F1 steering wheel to the Wedding Crashers star. </p>\n<p>\nVitaly's race engineer Gianluca Pisanello then talked him through the timetable his car crew was working to with under an hour until lights out. </p>\n<p>\nMeanwhile, word was spreading across the paddock that the biggest celebrity at the race was in our garage. </p>\n<p>\nSuddenly, we were inundated with TV cameras and photographers, all desperate for a shot that would fill Monday's back pages or an interview that adds to the pre-race build up for the fans at home. </p>\n<p>\nOscar winner Adrien Brody, in town with his friend Owen on a movie shoot, also appeared and the media frenzy around what was already an incredibly busy pit intensified. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAll of this mayhem was going on but it did not distract the team from the job in hand. </p>\n<p>\nThe cars were still being fired up, tyre pressures were being checked and pitstop equipment was examined to make sure it would work as planned at the critical moment. </p>\n<p>\nAnd the most calm people in the frenzy were the boys in green and yellow. </p>\n<p>\nThis is F1 in a nutshell. </p>\n<p>\nWe go around the world to race the most incredible machines in incredibly demanding environments. </p>\n<p>\nHundreds of millions of people watch every single race and the biggest stars on the planet drop by because it is up there with the Oscars for global attention. </p>\n<p>\nBut at the heart of it are the teams Â— the men and women who make the show happen Â— and even when they have the surreal experience of looking up and seeing Hollywood royalty inspecting their work, they just get on with it. </p>\n<p>\nF1 is a world of contrasts and that is what makes it what it is. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"GARAGE GUEST ...
