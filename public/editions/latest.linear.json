The Sun saw the process repeated 20 times in dozens of streets that night. And more hydrants were opened on Thursday night. </p>\n<p>\nNearly 1,100 hydrants have been flushed since September in areas including Bexhill and Burwash, East Sussex, and Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge, Kent. </p>\n<p>\nSouth East Water supplies drinking water to 2.1million customers in Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire. </p>\n<p>\nLike other companies it is introducing restrictions to combat the effects of an increasingly severe drought brought on by two abnormally dry winters. </p>\n<p>\n<i>The use of hosepipes for watering gardens, washing cars, filling ponds, cleaning patios and boats and filling swimming and paddling pools will be banned. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSouth East Water director Paul Seeley has already suggested on TV that people could take short showers instead of having a bath. </p>\n<p>\nA drought report from the Environment Agency last week listed the company's Ardingly reservoir in West Sussex and Bewl Water reservoir on the Kent-East Sussex border as \"exceptionally low\". </p>\n<p>\nA special order allows Ardingly to take water from dwindling river supplies. And it is expected that more will be pumped from the Lower Ouse, causing extra distress to fish and wildlife already suffering from low water levels. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne water industry worker said of the flushing: \"It is morally wrong and even employees with 30 years' experience have been outraged.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSouth East Water said in a statement last night that flushing is due to finish this week. </p>\n<p>\nBut information passed to The Sun indicates there are plans for the work to continue for at least three weeks. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe statement added: \"Flushing takes place during the night to ensure that there is less disruption to our customers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We are doing everything to save water during this time of drought. However we do need to occasionally flush our mains from start to finish to maintain the water quality. </p>\n<p>\n\"In Bexhill we received feedback about water discolouration so it was important that we carried out the work to ensure the system was running crystal clear.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut other water companies say they curb flushing operations in a drought. </p>\n<p>\nBristol Water says on its website: \"If we were short of water, then flushing  even though it is important work  would be curtailed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNational drought co-ordinator Helen Vale said: \"We expect water companies to do more to tackle leaks and continue their campaigns to encourage customers to use water wisely.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<i>b.jackson@the-sun.co.uk</a></i>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nFirst leak table is revealed<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\nWATCHDOGS have published the first leak league table  shaming Thames Water as Britain's worst offender. </p>\n<p>\nThames, the nation's biggest supplier with 8.8million customers, loses 665million litres <b>EVERY DAY</b>.

He killed her and then poured petrol on the body and set it alight. </p>\n<p>\nHe removed his brother from the house, and began to tell neighbours what he would later tell police in interview  that an intruder had broken into the house and killed his mother and escaped out of a window. </p>\n<p>\nBut he was found guilty of murder after a trial earlier this year. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking after the verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Kate Meynell, from Nottinghamshire Police said: \"The level of violence, the degree of planning and the extent of his lies is not only shocking, but it's also chilling that a boy could do this. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I've never dealt with something like this and I'm not aware of any other case in this country. He thought he could commit the perfect murder and get away with it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard how officers who searched the boy's room found violent drawings and writings, along with a claw hammer and a container of cleaning fluid. </p>\n<p>\nThey also discovered that websites he had looked up included \"Man kills wife and makes it\"; \"How to get away with murder\", and \"People who get away with murder in shows\". </p>\n<p>\nForensic examinations of his computer also found footage of violent scenes from Trial and Retribution, EastEnders, Hollyoaks, and Coronation Street  the latter including the Stape murder scene. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard how Bartlam had also written the sick story in which he played the main character, someone who got away with rape and murder. </p>\n<p>\nHe described the character murdering a woman with a hammer and setting the house on fire. </p>\n<p>\nHe thought he had deleted the story completely before committing his crime  but experts recovered the file from his computer's auto save. </p>\n<p>\nAn ITV spokesman said: \"ITV takes careful steps to ensure that pre-watershed drama is appropriate for a family audience, and the Stape murder scenes in Coronation Street were fully compliant.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn a statement, Jacqueline's parents said: \"We find it so hard to explain what we are going through.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There are no winners here because not only have we lost Jacqui, but we have lost Daniel too because of what he's done.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We know it was the right result at court but trying to understand how a boy you have loved for 14 years can do something like this is so difficult.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"To find out that Daniel planned to kill his own mother and then hear all the details, it is all so hard to believe.

This is thanks to the way it supports the structures beneath the skin's surface, including the main protein collagen.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe added: \"Plants protect themselves from sun damage with pigments such as lutein and anthocyanidins. When these are present in high quantities in our diet we see a complex effect on skin chemistry: a natural SPF is achieved.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she warned that fair-skinned people would still need to stay in the shade or use an SPF 50-plus cream. </p>\n<p>\nMedics tested Colladeen in the same way as protective creams and lotions. </p>\n<p>\nThey found it strengthened small blood vessels that feed oxygen and nutrients to cells, strengthening the inner and outer layers of skin. </p>\n<p>\nInitial trials on 60 men and women were carried out by the independent Aspen Laboratories in Maldon, Essex. </p>\n<p>\nPeople who took the tablet daily for 12 weeks had an enhanced defence against sun damage.

But I don't think she realises I'm in love with her yet.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pair met at Portmarnock Community College in Dublin six years ago and became mates. But Ryan realised he had fallen in love when he took Katie to their school prom last September. He said: \"When I saw her in that dress, I thought she looked beautiful. </p>\n<p>\n\"She makes me nervous. I don't want to rush in.

There are still bands going in the top 10. </p>\n<p>\n\"Obviously pop acts have more money in their marketing budgets but you can overcome that with serious amounts of touring and hard work like old fashioned pop bands used to do. </p>\n<p>\n\"We've just got to keep on top of what we're doing and not worry about the future of the music industry.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGuitarist Dan White added: \"I think that's why we've got to where we are now  through dedication, working really hard and our love for it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We love going around the country in our van, sleeping on floors.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd they're certainly not begrudging the lack of five-star hotel accommodation that was synonymous with the guitar group scene of the not-too-distant past. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBassist Jim Cratchley said: \"That's probably the biggest change in the music industry between now and four years ago. </p>\n<p>\n\"No one has a plane anymore, no one stays in hotels. You sleep on your mate's floor.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJohnny, Dan and Jim  minus drummer Miguel Demelo  performed their single We Were Children, Coming Of Age and a cover of Lady Gaga's You And I at their impressive session. </p>\n<p>\nTribes formed in 2010 and very quickly rocketed to prominence, supporting the Pixies \"on our sixth gig, before we'd even made 10 quid\". </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir album Baby draws heavily on singer Johnny's torment following the death of his pal Charles Haddon  the frontman of Ou Est Le Swimming Pool who committed suicide in 2010 in the backstage area of Belgium's Pukkelpop festival. </p>\n<p>\nHe also candidly references the collapse of his romance with an ex-girlfriend on several tracks. </p>\n<p>\nJohnny said: \"The album's not depressing but it's on the button of what was happening in my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"The Charlie stuff  like Corner Of An English Field and Nightdriving  was just looking back at our friendship. </p>\n<p>\n\"The break-up stuff was just the general mess of my love life at that time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough his personal woes provided Johnny with a focus when he was penning tunes for the record, he's adamant that songwriters don't need to be miserable to be at their best. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I think you can write a song out of nowhere,\" he said. </p>\n<p>\n\"John Lennon proved that with many a track. But it is good to use your own experiences. It's easier because it's more believable for you.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn keeping with their traditional values, Tribes recorded the whole of Baby on tape  snubbing the popular trend of using computer technology. </p>\n<p>\nDan said: \"We were sick of hearing so much music that was so obviously tweaked and tuned and cut up and made to sound perfect and polished. </p>\n<p>\n\"There's a lack of humanity to it. We wanted to make something that was inherently just four friends in a room together. </p>\n<p>\n\"Tape lends itself to that because you have to be at your best because it captures you naked. It was exhilarating. </p>\n<p>\n\"We got in there, got out and got back on the road.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>And you can catch them on the road when they tour the UK in April and May.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nClick here</a> for dates. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Old-fashioned values ...

Show me the five big hits at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the US charts.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, 1D have achieved something incredible with their album and the speed of their success. </p>\n<p>\nWhat makes their achievement even more jaw-dropping is that they have got this level of success in America without a huge single under their belts. </p>\n<p>\nThat is only possible now because of the power of social media. We've seen a similar thing with the film The Hunger Games. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn both cases people have heard about them through friends  so they feel like they have ownership. </p>\n<p>\nThe seeds were cleverly planted by Simon Cowell and his SYCO record label for 1D and the film company for The Hunger Games. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a gap to fill. Every generation needs its own fresh pop experience. America was ready for a boyband and they didn't have one of their own. </p>\n<p>\nNow they have fallen in love with not one but two British boybands at once. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRivals The Wanted have peaked at No2 in the singles chart in America with Glad You Came. </p>\n<p>\nBut The Wanted must be furious that One Direction timed it slightly better. Neither group could have predicted how much appetite there is for a new boyband. </p>\n<p>\nThe only other acts filling the pop void are teen, or tween, performers like Justin Bieber. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I say boyband, we are talking about the generation of boy groups who started in the Nineties. We think of Take That and Westlife as world famous but they never came close to cracking America. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nNone of them had a No1 album there. So, for 1D to achieve the No1 is an incredible achievement. </p>\n<p>\nAmerica has loved many British rock groups  the Stones, Coldplay, The Kinks and The Who and, of course The Beatles. </p>\n<p>\nIt has also loved many of its own boybands, from The Monkees to 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nPreviously, the peak achievement by a British boyband was 5ive with their self-titled album in 1998  it was No27. </p>\n<p>\nThe highest position Take That ever reached was 69, although they did have one Top Ten single  Back For Good  which got to No7. Westlife peaked at 129 in the US album chart. </p>\n<p>\nEven when Robbie Williams left Take That and became a huge star across the world, he remained relatively unknown in the US. </p>\n<p>\nScreaming is nothing new now. But even in 1964 it was not new. Teen hysteria began with Frank Sinatra in the 1940s. It happens once every ten years or so. It happened with Elvis in the Fifties, then with the Osmonds, Jackson Five, David Cassidy. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey have all made good music. </p>\n<p>\nBut what they all share in common is that they satisfy the raging hormones. </p>\n<p>\nAt the moment, for whatever reason, 1D are satisfying a lot of American hormones. </p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nMacca: Keep your identity </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By LEIGH HOLMWOOD</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSIR Paul McCartney has warned One Direction that being compared to The Beatles is the \"kiss of death\". </p>\n<p>\nThe crazy scenes of screaming fans as 1D tour the US and Canada have been compared to the Beatlemania of 1964 when Paul, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison first hit North America. </p>\n<p>\nBut Sir Paul, 69, said the lads should be wary of any comparisons with the Fab Four as the pressure could get too much for them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd he cited the example of Oasis  who were also compared to The Beatles  of what can go wrong. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It is the kiss of death. There are so many bands who all get called 'the next Beatles'. </p>\n<p>\n\"Suddenly it puts an awful lot of pressure on them to be the next Beatles. </p>\n<p>\n\"Oasis were 'the next Beatles' once. It's a pressure, because suddenly you've got to live up to all the things that we did, and it was a different time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut he revealed he is a fan of One Direction  and wished the boys luck. </p>\n<p>\nHe told ITV1's Daybreak: \"Let's just call them the next terrific band.

She was strict, but wanted a daughter who could look after herself. </p>\n<p>\nI was not the easiest of girls to bring up. From very young I seemed to know what I wanted to do in life  singing, dancing, acting. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant my mum had to drive for miles to take me to various classes. She was always encouraging about self-improvement. </p>\n<p>\nShe took me to auditions in Los Angeles, which was on the other side of the country from where we lived in Florida. </p>\n<p>\nI was born in Oak Ridge, a small town in Tennessee, but was brought up mostly in St Petersburg, Florida, after my mother remarried. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she and Dad were together, they did not have much money. But I was happy as a kid. </p>\n<p>\nIt made me realise you don't have to be rich to be happy. My dad used to hunt ducks and my mum would put them in the pot. We lived modestly. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum says I was born really ballsy. She's put up with it very well. </p>\n<p>\nI attended a Pentecostal church and then a Christian school. I had to obey strict rules at school and at home. I was grounded a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI got a diploma from a correspondence programme. It was the deal I made with my mum. I had to have a real diploma before she would allow me to drop out of Christian school and move to Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some struggles along the way, which my mum has seen me through. I am also not the easiest of people to be friends with. </p>\n<p>\nI think it is my fault. I work away from home and have learned to be on my own. </p>\n<p>\nI don't socialise much on a film set and don't have to become best friends with the people I work with. </p>\n<p>\nThere is a saying in Hollywood that what happens on a film set stays on a film set. But if I'd ever dated a co-star, it would have been downright depressing. Most actors would not appeal to most women, if they actually met them. </p>\n<p>\nI met Brian when I was 18. I was too young to remember his show, Beverly Hills 90210, so I didn't know who he was. But I knew I was instantly in love. </p>\n<p>\nThere is no secret to being a sex symbol. I play the game, that's all. </p>\n<p>\nIf people want to think of me as wild and crazy, that's up to them. The fact is, I've only had two serious boyfriends in my life  and I married one. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI have the same hang-ups as any other girl. Am I too fat? Too thin? Do I wear the right clothes? You think about it so much, it can hurt how you live. </p>\n<p>\nSo am I insecure? God, yes. Show me a woman who says she's totally secure about everything in her life and I will show you a pain in the ass. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some bad moments along the way, during which calls to my mum have meant a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI lived in New York, doing TV comedy Hope &amp; Faith, and it was cold and miserable. </p>\n<p>\nI was either at work or home in a little apartment, on my own. I let whole days slip by, doing nothing. </p>\n<p>\nI am confident in how I project myself but not in terms of how I look. It all came to a head when I was making 2008 film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People in London. </p>\n<p>\nThere was one scene in which I danced around in lingerie. I suddenly felt like I couldn't do the scene and asked if I could wear a skirt. </p>\n<p>\nThe director, quite rightly, said it would look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nBut I was not happy. It ended up with the producer serving me a beer before the scene. I was tired from working non-stop on several films, was suffering from jet lag on the trip to England and started to worry about my ability. </p>\n<p>\nThat's where Mum comes in. I called her a few times from London and she was able to calm me down and encourage me. </p>\n<p>\nI am still her little girl, whatever way you want to look at it. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"'Mum says I was born ballsy' ... actress Megan Fox","uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02FOXX_1482370a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02MEG2-_1482371a.jpg"}],"article":[{"caption":"Is Megan Fox expecting a baby?","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4225465/Is-Megan-Fox-expecting-a-baby.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"The Dictator will rule screens this Spring","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4225048/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-stars-in-new-trailer-to-The-Dictator.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Megan Fox serves up a tasty treat in new advert","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4192011/Megan-Fox-serves-up-a-tasty-treat-in-new-advert.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"Megan's the face of an Angel in latest shoot","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4164565/Megan-Fox-is-the-face-of-an-Angel-in-latest-shoot.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":"My tattoos are a Meg-a mistake","uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4160020/Megan-Fox-tattoo-Star-is-having-her-Marilyn-Monroe-inking-lasered-off.html?iPadApp=true"},{"caption":{"#":"Megan Fox is back in her bikini"},"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4145794/Megan-Fox-looks-hot-in-her-bikini-in-Kona-Hawaii.html?iPadApp=true"}]},"_id":"4f79b306980bb8d074000025"},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Fan ...

See how here","timestamp":"Mon, 02 Apr 2012 11:38:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nLESS is more when it comes to working out. Doing as little as four minutes  or one \"HIT\"  can be better for you than an hour's slog. </p>\n<p>\nThe four-minute, high-intensity training session can increase your aerobic and anaerobic capacity and speed up the metabolism, helping you burn more fat and make you look 200 per cent leaner than a traditional 60-minute aerobic workout. </p>\n<p>\nKnown as the closest thing we have to a fitness miracle, the HIT workout is loved by researchers and fitness pros alike for its fat-torching abilities and simplicity. </p>\n<p>\nCeleb fans include Jessica Biel and Cameron Diaz. </p>\n<p>\nHIT workouts are not easy, but are appealing to time-starved mums, working women and anyone juggling a hectic life. </p>\n<p>\nSun fitness expert Nicki Waterman says: \"My advice is to combine your plan with 30 minutes of aerobic exercise like fast walking, jogging, swimming, cycling or dancing, for example, to get the maximum effect. </p>\n<p>\n\"To do a HIT, simply pick an exercise and set a timer for 20 seconds on and ten seconds rest. </p>\n<p>\n\"Do the exercise as hard as you possibly can for 20 seconds and then rest for ten, repeating eight to 20 times in total. And remember, you have to work to 100 per cent maximum intensity. By the end of the four minutes you should feel like you've done a full workout and have nothing else to give.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out my favourites to get you started for one week. </p>\n<p>\nBut please check with your doctor before starting this exercise programme. And always warm up and cool down for at least five minutes before and after each HIT session. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MONDAY:</b> <b>Skipping</b> </p>\n<p>\nCARDIO and coordination all in one. Take a skipping rope and jump as fast as you can, using whichever foot pattern you like. </p>\n<p>\nOptions include both feet together, high knees, the \"boxer shuffle\" with heels in front, alternating feet, and butt-kickers. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Make sure your rope is long enough before you start  nothing ruins a good HIT workout like getting whipped across your calves. </p>\n<p>\nTo check for proper length, stand in the centre of your rope and pull the handles straight up. They should come at least as high as your armpits. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TUESDAY:</b> <b>Jumping Lunges</b> </p>\n<p>\nYou already know and love (to hate?) lunges for their butt-blasting ability. Add a jump in between alternating legs to up the difficulty and cardio factor. </p>\n<p>\nStart by stepping your right foot forward into a deep lunge, until your leg is parallel with the ground. Then jump, bringing your back (left) foot forward and landing in a lunge. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> You can step through each lunge if jumping gets too hard. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDNESDAY:</b> <b>Box Jumps</b> </p>\n<p>\nFind a weight bench, or a step that hits somewhere between your shins and your knees. </p>\n<p>\nStand in front of it and jump on top of the bench/step with both feet together. </p>\n<p>\nJump back to the floor, again with both feet together. Try not to rest when you land and jump right back up again. </p>\n<p>\nIf this is too difficult, you can do step-ups onto the box instead. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THURSDAY:</b> <b>Mountain Climbers</b> </p>\n<p>\nMake a triangle with your hands and feet on the floor with your butt up in the air. Bring one leg towards your chest. Keeping hands on the ground, jump to switch your legs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Just quickly touch each toe down so you're not resting by putting whole foot down. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>FRIDAY:</b> <b>Hindu Squats</b> </p>\n<p>\nThese are similar to a traditional squat but instead of stopping when your thighs are parallel to the ground, you continue down, dropping your butt towards your heels until your fingertips brush the ground. </p>\n<p>\nGoing through the full range of motion gets your heart rate up faster and engages more muscles. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Don't be afraid  contrary to popular belief, researchers now say that for healthy people, squatting to the ground won't hurt your knees. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SATURDAY: Bicycle Sprints</b> </p>\n<p>\nBikes are perfect for engaging your whole lower body and really getting your heart rate up for those 20 seconds. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> It's a little easier to time and to rest on a stationary bike  you can just take your feet off the pedals for ten seconds rather than trying to start and stop/coast on the road. </p>\n<p>\nThe HIT diet plan </p>\n<p>\n<b>SUN nutritionist Amanda Ursell says:</b> \"If your aim is to lose weight, then you need to combine your workout with a style of eating that provides energy to exercise, yet cuts empty calories that are keeping your body mass index high. </p>\n<p>\n\"Timing of your meals and snacks is especially important because your body needs fuel to cope with the HIT workout before you start and, once you have finished, to allow your muscles to recover and be ready for the next hard session. </p>\n<p>\n\"Here's how to eat to lose weight but keep your body healthy and able to cope with the HIT plan over the coming week.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Before you train:</b> Whether you train before breakfast, before lunch or at the end of the day before dinner, have something like a handful of raisins, a banana or even a small smoothie an hour to 30 minutes before you start. </p>\n<p>\n<b>During training:</b> Drink \"to thirst\". This simply means have a drink when you feel the need and stop once you no longer feel thirsty. </p>\n<p>\n<b>After training:</b> Have your meal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner within half an hour of finishing. If you can't manage this, have another small snack like some dried fruit or a cereal bar. </p>\n<p>\n<b>YOUR DAILY DIET</b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Breakfast:</b> This is not the week to skip breakfast, however rushed your daily schedule. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are training early, have breakfast once you have finished. If not, make time to have it before you leave the house. </p>\n<p>\nHave a breakfast of porridge made with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk with some dried fruit such as chopped apricots; a wholegrain cereal such as Oatibix or Weetabix or a fruit salad which includes a banana with some zero per cent fat Total Greek yoghurt and a handful of sunflower seeds. </p>\n<p>\nAlternatively, have two poached or boiled eggs with two pieces of toast and a glass of orange or apple juice. </p>\n<p>\nHave a glass of water and your usual cup of tea or coffee using skimmed milk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-morning:</b> Have a handful of nuts such as almonds, cashews, pistachios or Brazil nuts with an apple, orange or a pear and a glass of water. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lunch:</b> Build your lunch around an average-sized portion of carbohydrate foods that give you a steady supply of energy. These include pitta breads, tortilla wraps, bread, pasta, noodles, or a baked potato. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich food such as tuna, chicken, turkey, lean slices of roast beef, hard-boiled eggs, prawns, cottage or ricotta cheese, pulses such as baked beans, peas or lentils, tofu or Quorn products. </p>\n<p>\nHave some veg with these such as tomato and cucumber in a sandwich, lettuce and spring onions in a wrap or pitta or salad with a baked potato and baked beans. Always have some water with your lunch. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-afternoon:</b> A couple of oat cakes with some cottage or ricotta cheese and berries; a slice of peanut butter on toast; an apple with a small matchbox-size piece of reduced-fat Cheddar or a handful of mixed nuts and raisins. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dinner:</b> As with lunchtime, dinner needs to be a mix of an average-size serving of carbohydrate-based foods such as new boiled potatoes, pasta, rice or noodles. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich foods such as lean red meat  lean mince, a lean pork chop or lean roast lamb; Turkey, chicken or ham; grilled, baked or canned fish; tofu, Quorn mince or \"chicken\" pieces, pulses such as baked beans. </p>\n<p>\nAlso add some vegetables. Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, green beans, sweetcorn, tomatoes, onions  whichever you enjoy and find easy to prepare. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Fan ...

The way I see it, I'm helping the women because the men go home happier. I provide an emotional outlet for men bored by their wives.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn fact, she jokingly refers to herself as \"an alternative marriage counsellor\".\n</p>\n<p>\nShe continues: \"As well as satisfying them, I also give the men advice on their failing personal lives. I love the excitement of doing something I shouldn't.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And, what's even better is I can hand them back to their wives when I'm done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>A \"feisty\" woman who has never had a problem getting a date, Dee first went out with a taken man about four years ago.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I enjoyed my time with him and, although it came to an end, it didn't put me off.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I loved the fact I could be with him when it suited me and I didn't have to be exclusively with him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFinding herself single again in January after a long-term relationship, Dee decided she was going to hunt down more married men to get some excitement back in her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I just wanted some fun  so I typed 'meet a married man' into an internet search engine.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin minutes, Dee had created an online profile on the website Illicit Encounters and was receiving loads of requests for dates.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"It is so flattering and exciting. I love knowing that all these men want is to take me out and ravish me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>With no baggage, no strings and no emotional involvement, Dee could have her cake and eat it  at the expense of somebody else.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShockingly, these types of websites actually facilitate affairs for people who are unhappy in their sex-less relationships but have no intention of leaving their partner.\n</p>\n<p>\nCareer girl Dee is currently seeing three married men \"on rotation\".\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explains: \"Once a fortnight, the men will take me out to posh restaurants or for drinks in swanky bars  I even cook dinner for one of them at my house.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Amazingly, Dee doesn't feel any guilt.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They are the ones cheating, not me. I have spent all of my adult life in relationships where I have to think about the other person. I deserve time when I only have to think of myself  I am too independent to be in a relationship at the moment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNaturally, most people who use the site do so in secret. She says: \"I find it safer to keep phone contact to a minimum. I don't want anyone's wife to find out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I wait for them to contact me  then I know it is safe to reply.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee feels this type of dating is particularly good because she gets treated like a princess.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I get taken to top restaurants and many of the men buy me elaborate gifts  one guy bought me a TV and DVD player. But most importantly, I get showered with affection.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Ultimately, after a few dates, the evening out will result in sex. If a guy calls and I'm not in the mood, I say so. If, by the end of the date, I want to invite them in, that's my prerogative. I'm totally in control and I love that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee isn't physical with all of them  some men she \"helps\" just want to talk to her. In fact, she has stayed in steady contact with one man since November but knows she will never meet him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We are having an email affair, if there is such a thing,\" she explains.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He and I both know that we will never meet due to distance but this suits us both  we flirt and chat online.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There is obviously something missing in his life that I fill. I am happy to oblige  he is very sweet to me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Although the majority of her dating experiences have been good, there have been some disastrous ones too.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"It's always a nightmare when they fall in love with you. One guy declared that I belonged to him after only two dates.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He told me that I wasn't allowed to date or flirt with any other men  hypocritical as he had a wife at home. I ended that quickly.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee admits she likes Illicit Encounters because of the upwardly mobile men that the site claims to attract. She says: \"On the whole, all of the users are in well-paid jobs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The calibre of males I am meeting is certainly what makes me go back for more. They are all well-groomed and sophisticated. Who wouldn't want to be showered with gifts and shown a luxurious lifestyle?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAsked if she ever gets attached to the men she sleeps with, the answer is a firm no. \"I just switch off. I make my intentions clear from the start and once the guidelines are set, there's no going back.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Dee makes extramarital affairs look easy, but they do come with risks.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"All of these men have children and some have been caught out, \"It may sound stupid, but I actually think most of the wives involved just turn a blind eye to their husband's infidelity. They have a lifestyle they want to protect.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Many have the car, the home, the children, the holidays. If they finished the relationship, they would risk losing all that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing more exciting than knowing I'll get to flirt over a candlelit dinner or secretly hold hands in the cinema.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I know most people think this is all about sex, but it isn't. Despite what people assume, there is an emotional connection and we do think of each other. I wouldn't sleep with just anyone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Since I initially logged on, I have only been on dates with around 12 men in total  I am still fussy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"In a nutshell, I am a bubbly and outgoing woman who loves attention but doesn't want a relationship  this type of lifestyle is tailor-made for me!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>But this isn't a life that Dee will continue with forever.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll stay on the site for a year or so then make a decision about what I want from there. I'm going travelling at Christmas, so it suits me to have another six months of no-strings fun.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee describes her last three months as \"feeling like a kid in a sweet shop\".\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explains: \"I'm addicted to the thrill of it. I've found that some of the men are separated but not divorced yet. I'm not interested in them, it's not exciting enough. I go for the ones who are still married.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Asked how she would feel if her future husband cheated on her, she chuckles:</i> <i>\"Of course I'd be upset, but there's no way I'll ever conform  that's just the way I am.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Cheat is on ...

We are here to turn each and every one of you into clued-up cupids. </p>\n<p>\nEvery fortnight, sex and relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr throws open the doors to her online Academy. Learning to be a good lover has never been so easy! </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight's lecture: It's time to talk...with a difference </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBBC hit programme The Voice shows how you can take away looks but the human voice is still so powerful. That power extends to phone sex with a whopping 59 per cent of the under 35s experimenting with it to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately it's easy to get wrong and embarrass yourself. Thankfully some boffins in their science labs have done lots of new research on the human voice. </p>\n<p>\nLittle did they know I can help you apply their findings to spare your blushes when you get on the blower. </p>\n<p>\nHere are my top tips for teasing talk on the telephone - </p>\n<p>\n* Sex talk is equally about what you say and how you say it so soften and lower your voice - research shows you immediately sound more attractive. </p>\n<p>\n* Slow your pace too - gabbling on is a turnoff. </p>\n<p>\n* Use a confident tone - research shows you boost each other's sexual confidence this way. </p>\n<p>\n* Avoid 'telephonus-interruptus' - ensure you won't be disturbed. </p>\n<p>\n* Set the scene - you'll feel sexier chatting relaxing on the bed with the lights dimmed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Practice makes perfect - before chatting imagine what you might say to them. Say it aloud to your self - seems daft but it works! </p>\n<p>\n* Go easy now - start gently saying something like how much you loved the last time you were in bed together...but no more detail. </p>\n<p>\n* Gauge their response - see if they start chatting 'details'. </p>\n<p>\n* Next flirt enthusiastically - compliment them, tease them, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* See how hot the banter gets especially with a new partner. Be playful hinting, e.g., \"I'd like to try something involving my dressing gown sash and being tied up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.19: Successful phone sex is as much about listening as it is about talking.</b> </p>\n<p>\nStudy checklist for turning up the heat - </p>\n<p>\n* You're now equipped to step up the dirty talk. Tread carefully with a new partner so you don't offend them. </p>\n<p>\n* Remember you might want to whisper into the phone, \"I wish you could lick me all over,\" but don't begin with something triple X-rated. </p>\n<p>\n* Give each other sexy nicknames - sharing secret nicknames strengthens your bond. </p>\n<p>\n* Throw in an occasional raunchy comment when they're phone-flirting. </p>\n<p>\n* Now begin giving lots more detail about what you're doing to yourself plus what you want to do to each other! </p>\n<p>\n* Keep in mind how far you can go - they might be happy to talk about being tied up or spanked but be turned off if you use rude words. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMake the best use of what your partner has revealed to you about their secret fantasies, e.g., maybe they've mentioned being rescued by a hunky fireman or looked after by a sexy nurse. Use this info to heighten your phone sex session. </p>\n<p>\nIf you've got lots of trust you can try sexting - sending hot pictures and messages to each other. Big Academy warning: if you don't have trust, don't do it! They could end up being forwarded to others. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many sex toys are sold in the UK each year - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 40,000 </p>\n<p>\nB) 400,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) 4 million </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer:</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is C) a staggering 4 million - get a stockbroker it's time to buy shares in batteries! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: Simon Cowell and his 'type'\n</h1>\n<p>\nIt's rumoured Simon Cowell's been hanging out with stunning makeup girl Francesca Neill. Mind you this is all completely innocent. And undoubtedly Simon Cowell is faithful to fianc&#233; Mezhgan Hussainy. </p>\n<p>\nBut he certainly likes to surround himself with his \"type\" - without fail gorgeous, immaculately groomed and glamorous brunettes. </p>\n<p>\nBeware though there can be big problems with having a romantic type. They can scupper your relationships and that's true for both men and women. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you keep trying to re-create a past relationship by seeking out a particular type, you never give the new person a chance. You try and force them into a mould. And this isn't fair on them or you in the long term. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight: The Starfish </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe needs to be flexible and he needs some strength to control this hot position as she doesn't move much. A good position for the couple where they like him to take control. </p>\n<p>\nShe lies on her back with him between her legs raised up on his hands. She brings both knees towards her chest. Depending on her flexibility she rest her feet either side his chest or on top of his shoulders. </p>\n<p>\nHe controls the action carefully and varies sensations by doing sensual circular moves with his hips, speeding up or slowing down. </p>\n<p>\nBy varying the style of his moves he can give her amazing sensations. If he moves slowly the Starfish builds their intimacy with good eye-contact. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Follow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's NEW sex-and-love guide is available to pre-order at Amazon</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>For more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>This fortnight's lecture</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>Put the science of sexual attraction to work for you</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBBC news presenter Susannah Reid's cleavage has taken on a life of its own - as reported in your Sun people are obsessed with it. That interest boils down to the science of attraction - those signals [in this case a shapely cleavage] that draw our attention. </p>\n<p>\nSometimes you haven't a clue why your eyes spring out of your head cartoon-style when you clock someone. But most of that first attraction is down to body language and other key signals we give. </p>\n<p>\nThose love-boffins found four specific brain regions light up when attracted to someone. This brain activation gives us butterflies in the stomach, feelings of euphoria, etc. -what we label Love Sickness. </p>\n<p>\nYou don't want to have to ring a doc but to stimulate a little Love Sickness in that special person here are 'his and hers' guides. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For her: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*New research shows a lower + slower tone of voice attracts his interest. You might have a complete laugh with your girlfriends but when you meet Mr. Potential slow it down, chill it out. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Give yourself as slim a waistline as possible with fashion tricks - belts, 'body cons', darker colours at the mid-line, etc. Subconsciously men are attracted to a slim waistline that signals youth and fertility. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Science shows large 'doe' eyes set high in the cheeks will attract him at a subconscious level [he can't quite put a finger on what makes you so alluring]. It's worth investing in fabulous false eyelashes. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Stand so your body forms a natural 'S' shape known to naturally attract his attention. Have one leg slightly further out making that hip dip slightly.

Footie team wins? Celebratory sex is on the menu. Footie team loses? It's consolatory sex to cheer him up. Best mate's birthday? Wey-hey, carry on the party at home and so on. </p>\n<p>\nBecause of this pressure men can feel completely useless when they lose sexual interest. Hey, where did it go? they wonder as they search high and low...um, nothing's happening in my boxers, nothing's happening when I wake up, or when she wears her special knickers, etc. </p>\n<p>\nOf course we women decide it must be us - we're not attractive enough anymore. He feels useless, she feels unattractive = not very good for the sex life. </p>\n<p>\nMen lose their va-va-va-voom for as many different reasons as women do - stress at work, not looking after themselves, rows between you two. But it can also be down to TDS - testosterone deficiency syndrome. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.17:</b> Students must let each other know when they're worried about not having sex. Stewing in silence is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough TDS usually strikes the over-50s it also hits many younger men especially from age 35 onwards. Not only do they lose interest in sex and find their erections aren't as powerful but they might feel they're less energetic generally and be more forgetful. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Begin by getting up the courage to speak to each other. You'll both feel so much better and mightily relieved you care enough to discuss things. </p>\n<p>\n* Check with your GP whether TDS or some other medical issue might be responsible for lack of sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep the affection and cuddles going between you. </p>\n<p>\n* Definitely have loads of fun sex-play - it doesn't have to go all the way. </p>\n<p>\n* For more TDS info visit www.sortEDin10.co.uk</a> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nWhether he's in the mood - or experiencing low sex drive  nothing's stopping you two from fun foreplay.

And, yes, some people might have fantasies about estate agents! </p>\n<p>\nInstead think of location as easy way to keep sex exciting. We're SO influenced by surroundings - no surprise the bedroom gets a bit ho-hum and boring. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Getting creative with locations -</b> </p>\n<p>\nAs long as you're not breaking any laws - or are very careful not to get caught - here are location suggestions. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 1:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* In the bath/shower with warm cascades of water rushing over you. </p>\n<p>\n* On the floor - any floor - but either one that's carpeted or put down a soft blanket. </p>\n<p>\n* Get carried away in the kitchen but you'll definitely need something to cushion kitchen floor tiles/countertops. </p>\n<p>\n* Working hard at your desk and want a break? Maybe you're in a hot new relationship - lean against your desk or workstation for a quickie. </p>\n<p>\n* Just in from an evening out? Why not have a quickie against the doorframe in your front hall. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 2:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* Everyone's gone home so you have the offices to yourselves. Make sure you don't get caught out by the late-night cleaner. </p>\n<p>\n* Get sex-perimental in a swimming pool - the buoyancy of the water makes things fun. Why not let the water lap around you as you go for it on a swimming pool lilo. </p>\n<p>\n* You're at a boring party - nip into the bathroom for a quickie without others knowing. </p>\n<p>\n* Gazing at the stars from a deck chair at your holiday hotel? Then try alfresco sex under the stars. Mind no one can see what you're doing - unless of course you're dogging - in which case that's a different story. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 3: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n* Time for some nail-biting adventure and get sneaky in your office during office hours. A good place is in the stationery cupboard, staff bathroom or behind your locked office door if you have the nerves for it. </p>\n<p>\n* Let's see if you can be so quiet while having sex in your garden shed while your neighbour's sitting next door in their garden haven't a clue. </p>\n<p>\n* Go for some sporting moments and do a 'Boris Becker' in the broom cupboard of a restaurant. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy warning: </b>Dubai is a popular holiday destination but never ever break indecency laws in a country like that. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.16:</b> Students should remember variety is the spice of life - that includes location. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Always have something to hand you can throw over yourselves to cover-up if someone comes by. </p>\n<p>\n* Always have a picnic blanket or at least a thick jacket to put under them for their comfort. Or to pad out any tender body part pressing against, e.g., a stone wall/tree-trunk. Naughty you if you haven't thought of your partner's comfort! </p>\n<p>\n* Pleasure each other with your hands or through oral sex when outdoors.

But if either goes queasy at the thought, there's plenty to discuss before slipping into a sex club armed with little more than a nervous grin and condoms. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule:</b> Must I tell you no one should be pressured into a three- or moresome if they're not into it? Exactly! Discussion is one thing, pressure is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nCouples who discuss fantasies to spice-up sex usually delve into the arena of three-ways. </p>\n<p>\nBut fantasies are SO different to reality. It's hard enough grappling with two sets of sexual needs plus the more embarrassing side of sex like sweaty bodies and surprising sounds. </p>\n<p>\nFactor in a third set of these things and suddenly keeping it only to fantasy-chat is appealing. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise if determined to go for it: </p>\n<p>\n* You both must really, really want to try it. </p>\n<p>\n* Agree how to go about it, e.g., do you want to look through contact mags or go to a local swinging party or fetish club to find a third-party. </p>\n<p>\n* Sex clubs all have their own rules so check these out. </p>\n<p>\n* Agreeing ground rules is a must. Some couples put certain sexual behaviour off limits like giving or receiving oral sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Accept either - or both - might experience jealousy if feeling threatened in any way by the third party. That includes thinking the third party is more attractive, better in bed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Excellent communication between you is crucial to avoid jealousy/insecurity. </p>\n<p>\n* Discuss whether you'll have the same third party involved in regular sex sessions or always look for new partners. Some couples prefer seeing the same third party. Others worry some sort of love triangle might form threatening their relationship. </p>\n<p>\n* Be prepared that after trying this one of you might go off the idea. </p>\n<p>\n* Get all MI6 about it and \"debrief\" after each experience to see how you're both feeling. </p>\n<p>\n* Crucial to abide by ground rules like NO outside contact - like phone calls - with any new sex partners. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nSpend time discussing each other's motives for wanting a threesome. Some are positive - you're both sexually confident and experimental. Others negative - you need a confidence boost or to combat bedroom boredom. </p>\n<p>\nNegative things need serious consideration because adding a third person is likely to complicate these. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nBefore going for it, get in bed and try to fully imagine having a third person in there with you. Spelling out the details to each other might make you more cautious. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Desire to try it + complete confidence between you = worth a shot! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How much cool cash did Michelle Obama reportedly spend this week in Agent Provocateur's New York emporium? </p>\n<p>\nA) &#163;320 </p>\n<p>\nB) &#163;32,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) &#163;3,200 </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge Answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - that's a heckuva lot of oh-oh-heaven for President Obama. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Heidi Klum and Seal</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nYep, this super-gorgeous couple are separated but Seal said in an interview this week he still loves Heidi. </p>\n<p>\nWhere there's love, there's a way to sort things out.

She then spins carefully around so she ends up facing his feet. </p>\n<p>\nThis position allows her to vary the pressure of penetration by varying the way she sits. </p>\n<p>\nLeaning forward, her hands on his ankles, decreases pressure. Leaning back, resting her hands at the side of his stomach, increases pressure. </p>\n<p>\nHe can hold her hips to maintain penetration so she doesn't slip off.

So if he or she is always pestering you for sex - and you just don't have the interest - you've got a lot of company. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not really surprising - after all when you got together he preferred pizza and she preferred Chinese. He loved an action holiday and she loved lying on the beach. So why wouldn't your sex drives be different too? </p>\n<p>\nBut there's double-trouble when this happens. The partner who has a higher drive feels neglected. And the partner who has a lower drive feels pestered or inadequate. </p>\n<p>\nThese issues have a way of creeping into the rest of your relationship even when you know you love your partner. Time to tackle the differences between your drives. </p>\n<p>\nThe first step is to stop any finger-pointing. Playing the blame game will get you nowhere. Being honest, loving and tactful is the only way to go. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.14: Students should remember there is no right or wrong to how high or low your sex drive is as long as you're both working towards a compromise.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\nHere are some [not all, mind you] of the main culprits affecting sex drive - see how many might apply to you or your partner. </p>\n<p>\n* lifestyle issues like out-of-control stress and long working hours </p>\n<p>\n* personal choices like excessive drinking, and 'recreational' drug use </p>\n<p>\n* being overweight leading to less sexual energy </p>\n<p>\n* experiencing depression and anxiety </p>\n<p>\n* relationship difficulties or breakdown, rows, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* certain physical problems like having a bad back are draining </p>\n<p>\n* fatigue after childbirth can kill sexual desire </p>\n<p>\n* surprising things affect sex drive including medications like the birth control pill, anti-depressants and blood pressure medications </p>\n<p>\n* hormonal changes later in life for both men and women </p>\n<p>\n* other passion killers include worries over financial problems </p>\n<p>\n* and to be brutally honest... plain old boredom in the bedroom can lead to lack of sex drive </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\nPut aside 10 minutes this weekend to study this list and work out if these - or any other things - are affecting your sex drive or your partner's. </p>\n<p>\nIf you identify a culprit or two what can you do about these? The first step is to share this info with your partner - a positive \"we can fix this together\" attitude has been proven to help. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're overly stressed at work  it's killed your sex drive leaving your partner high and dry. Obviously deal with the stresses - take on fewer responsibilities, talk to your manager about streamlining your work load, etc. </p>\n<p>\nBut when you feel up to a fun solution play a sex-game where you pretend to be someone completely different - someone without a care in the world. </p>\n<p>\nGive yourself 'permission' to let go and have fun.

If your partner's shy take their finger and gently suck and kiss it - then ask if those sensations feel good. Put that info to good use for kissing and sucking their different erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nAlso say something like, \"Do you prefer it when I stroke or squeeze you here?\" It gives them the confidence to be honest. </p>\n<p>\nDefo tell them it's exciting when they tell you what to do to them.

Or they get stuck just moving a vibrator back and forth - a bit snooze-inducing. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sex Toy Etiquette:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nNever introduce a sex toy by whipping a big, shiny, pulsating one out, waving it around and expecting your partner to be instantly aroused. Instead try these ploys \n</p>\n<p>\n*If unsure of their reaction be subtle - suggest popping into your local adult shop and gently steer them to the vibrators. </p>\n<p>\n*Start toying with said toys and look quizzical - as if you're wondering whether they'd be fun or not. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask if they've ever thought about what playing with a vibrator would be like. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep it light and flirty to give them confidence to take a good look at the toys. </p>\n<p>\n*Never grab the biggest vibrator (and crikey there are some huge ones on the market) particularly if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep sex toys as an added extra to your sex-play so your partner doesn't feel redundant. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Good Vibrations:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAlways use lashings of lubricant for a lovely smooth glide across any erogenous zone. </p>\n<p>\nRemember he might be just as keen as she is to feel a vibrator running up and down his chest, abdomen, between the thighs, over the perineum and anal area. </p>\n<p>\nProblem is many men don't want to appear anything but 'straight' - so she should suggest it. </p>\n<p>\nOr after he's used a vibrator on her erogenous zones she can tease him with it. Sometimes it takes her confidence that it's okay for him to enjoy vibrating pleasure for him to relax and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>\nFor added pleasure during penetrative sex slip the vibrator between you two. They come in all sorts of shapes/sizes so invest in a range for different uses - a slimmer one will slip between the two of you easier. </p>\n<p>\nJust in case it's got a powerful vibration, first run it across their abdomen so they can get used to the feel of it. Then you can ask if she's ready for it to be run across her breasts or he's ready to have it run between his thighs. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she's turned on, gently run it back and forth across her pubic mound. Rather than using the end of the vibrator to touch her skin, lay it 'flat' along her pubic bone and move it back and forth covering a bigger area with the vibrations. Guaranteed to drive her crazy! </p>\n<p>\nIt's definitely worth investing in a fingertip vibrator. Slip onto your forefinger and reach all sorts of tiny and exciting places that a normal-sized vibrator can't. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.12:</b> Students shouldn't use a vibrator for more than 20 minutes on one area as you can over-stimulate that area. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Hygiene is crucial so, e.g., if you use an anal vibrator it shouldn't then be used on her vagina. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep separate sex toys for each other. </p>\n<p>\n* Clean your sex toys as per the instructions. </p>\n<p>\n* Before you use a new sex toy get used to the way it works - some are complicated. </p>\n<p>\n* Never ever use everyday items as makeshift sex toys! </p>\n<p>\n* As well as pleasuring each other use for self-pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n* When using lubricants choose water-based ones that won't break down the surface of your plastic-based toys. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you've never tried a 'tongue joy' vibrator get one for oral pleasure! </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nThis neat little vibrator slips onto your tongue so that during oral sex not only does your partner feel the warmth and moistness of your lips and tongue but also the fabulous little vibrations from this sex toy.

Make this your sexiest Blissmas ever with my 12 simple steps: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 1:</b> Being time-short is the biggest problem so book one or two red hot dates in your diaries between now and Christmas. Don't let anything come between you and these dates. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 2:</b> Time to tempt each other - so turn up the flirt factor. All your messaging should be loving and sexy. </p>\n<p>\nAnd when you've got each other on Skype or the phone 'talk up' your forthcoming dates. Delve into delicious detail about what you're planning. </p>\n<p>\nThose sexologist boffins show that your phone voice can be a massive turn on - slightly lower it and speak a bit slower. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 3:</b> Both men and women like being told what turns their partner on. So send each other a sexy seasonal card describing five things you'd like to do when together. You can have fun deciding which techniques to try. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 4:</b> Sort out your sexy gear. Plan an outfit you feel confident in - confidence is sexy. </p>\n<p>\nIf you've got new sky-high heels break them in so they're comfortable on the big night. He might want you to keep them on in bed! </p>\n<p>\nWhat's underneath counts even more - he'll love the fact stockings and suspenders have made a comeback. And the guys should definitely sort out some sexy pants to turn her on. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 5:</b> Do a daring deed! Why not tease and touch each other under the table at a bar or restaurant. No one will guess why you two have such big smiles. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 6:</b> Turn your desire up a notch by agreeing you can't have full sex for a few days. When together enjoy some hot foreplay, touching and massage - but nothing further. </p>\n<p>\nGive each other a Thai Body Massage - strip off to the waist and with lashings of massage oil glide your bodies back and forth across each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 7:</b> Do some sizzling seasonal shopping - there are many fantastic toys at high street sex shops. </p>\n<p>\nInvesting in one fun and sexy toy will give hours of sex-tra pleasure. He may never have tried one but men love 'good vibrations' up and down, and in-between their thighs. </p>\n<p>\nGet to know how it works before sharing the sexy vibes with each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 8:</b> Dream up a festive fantasy to share. Get cosy and enjoy fantasy chat where you take turns saying what happens next in the fantasy scenario. </p>\n<p>\nFor instance, describe a fantasy where you're the boss and they're the assistant and you're the last two at the Christmas office party. You slip into the board room, lock the door and have your evil way with each other. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 9:</b> Get cracking and plan a new technique to try on them. Maybe you're a sensational snogger - why not think of some luscious lip-action for all over their body. </p>\n<p>\nTry the 'swirl and poke' kissing technique - alternate swirling your tongue around one of their erogenous zones with gently poking with it. Feels fabulous! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 10:</b> Buy some seasonal treats and prepare a candlelit picnic - maybe in the bedroom! </p>\n<p>\nGet their favourite finger foods as well as mini mince pies and chocolate Santas. Savour little mouthfuls before turning each other into a Christmas feast. </p>\n<p>\nTrickle some fizz down her cleavage for him to lick off. And sprinkle morsels of mince pies across his chest for her to nibble. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 11:</b> Get steamed up in a sensual shower to super-tease each other. You might have been out dancing at a Christmas 'do' and can get fresh and clean together. </p>\n<p>\nHave big, warm, fluffy towels ready to wrap each other up in. Enjoy some gorgeous, loving cuddles together. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Blissmas Day 12:</b> You've come to the end of your 12 days of Blissmas and tonight is 'the night'.

Yep, it's a legal relationship but that doesn't mean it is right. </p>\n<p>\nNeurologist boffins [they study the brain] have found that between the ages of 14 and 17 brains are rapidly changing leading too chaotic and confused feelings. It's hard enough for a 17-year-old to have a relationship with someone of the same age - let alone someone 15 years older. Add to this the intense national scrutiny and I can only see it ending in tears. </p>\n<p>\nThere's nothing wrong with an age gap relationship on the whole - but they work far better if both people have at least reached their 20s. Otherwise there's a risk the older partner takes over and controls everything. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Sexy Santa [normally called The Staging Post] </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI specially renamed this red hot position The Sexy Santa for Christmas.

So a man might say he has a 'fetish' for large breasts but lo-and-behold his partner has small ones. And a woman might say she has a 'fetish' for men in gym gear but she doesn't turn into a raving nympho the minute a man strolls into her aerobics class. </p>\n<p>\nWhere do fetishes come from? Sometimes the development of a fetish is very complex but other fetishes are easily understood. Take the teenage boy pleasuring himself as he stands at his bedroom window. He catches sight of the neighbour doing some gardening in her Wellington boots and hey, presto, Wellington boots forever hold a special meaning. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a fetish checklist every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Always ask your partner to describe exactly what they mean by 'fetish'. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Check out if they can only be turned on with their fetish or if it's simply a preference. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Have fun considering compromises. For instance, if he has a fetish for women in PVC it might work for her to slip into a PVC basque OR miniskirt. She doesn't have to dress head-to-toe in it yet he'll love the fact she's wearing one PVC piece. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>See if fantasy chat about the fetish will satisfy that partner's desire. You could potentially chat up a storm about him worshiping your feet - instead of him actually licking and sucking your toes if that turns you right off [think Fergie all those years ago]. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Some fetishes might seem downright comical - like a fetish for pink, fluffy slippers or footie strips. But resist having a laugh at your partner if they're willing to trust you and open up. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>If either of you are troubled by their fetish consider sex therapy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule: Be honest if a fetish turns you off.</b> If a fetish like splodging [having a 'good' time hurling cream cakes, etc., or rolling around in puds] makes you laugh it can spoil the moment for the partner that takes their splodging seriously. </p>\n<p>\nDitto if your partner has what you think is a disgusting fetish involving something like 'scat play' [let's not even go there!] put your foot down fast. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> Think through how you can enjoy your partner's fetish. Let's say they've a fetish for gloves. Buy a pair and surprise them during foreplay by whisking them on. </p>\n<p>\nFor their added pleasure select the texture your partner prefers - soft and velvety, smooth and silky, firm and leathery. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy sex trick:</b> as you'll be left- or right-handed - and probably use that hand in foreplay - try swapping over. Use the hand you don't normally use to caress them giving a new sensation. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A fun attitude + fun fetishes = fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of people have a foot fetish according to fetish research - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 1.1% </p>\n<p>\nB) 11% </p>\n<p>\nC) 21% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - just over 1% of people reportedly have a foot fetish. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Jennifer Lopez and Casper Smart </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nJ-Lo, 42, has revealed her credentials as a top-class cougar by getting with tattooed toyboy dancer Casper Smart, 24. The chemistry between them sizzles and right now they seem inseparable. </p>\n<p>\nBut I hope Jennifer's as savvy as Madonna when it comes to cougar love. Madonna plays by a simple rule: these are fun, sexy relationships that both parties can enjoy... but they're not permanent! </p>\n<p>\nDemi Moore on the other hand has found out the tough way most younger men don't stick around for a happy-ever-after. There's far too much temptation out there and most aren't in the mental place yet for a committed, lifelong relationship. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Lovers' Embrace</b> </p>\n<p>\nTry moving into this sensual position from classic Missionary (where he's on top). </p>\n<p>\nAll he needs to do is gently slide off of her while gently pulling her towards him - so they end up on their sides facing each other. Once in position she simply lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p>\nTo vary the sexy sensations she can move her leg further up his hip - or close it down more tightly around his knees. By wrapping her leg around his knees and pulling his legs more into hers it adds lots of good friction between them - great if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\nSextra Academy tip: Allow your hands to wander over each other's backs and bums. You can cradle each other's bottoms so that the pressure of your movements don't push you two apart. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>For more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons: Friends with Benefits </h1>\n<p>\nWe told you this week of a new survey suggesting pals are providing more than a 'friendly shoulder' to their best mates. Evidently a whopping 33% of single girls sleep with their male friends. </p>\n<p>\nSuch friendship fringe benefits put a smile on many faces. But handled badly friends can fall-out over their best mate booty-calls. </p>\n<p>\nHere are definite 'dos and don'ts' for your friendship that strays into full-sex territory: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Friends often flirt with each other - which is why many question whether men and women can really 'just be friends'. So take it cautiously if there's been flirting between you and secretly you'd like things to end up in bed. They may not feel the same! </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> It's likely the first time you two slept together it was under the influence of too many drinks...the classic starting point for so many friends with fringe benefits. So have a chat the morning after to make sure you're both feeling okay about it. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Never humiliate your friend by telling your other pals what you two got up to. Keeping it between your selves avoids loads of gossip or other friends sticking their oar in. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Even if you two have occasionally gone all-the-way no friend should feel pressured to always say Yes to a booty call. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Don't be surprised when your friendly fringe benefits end because one of you finds a proper boyfriend or girlfriend. No room for jealousy - after all you were only friends that took it further. </p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No.9: Always be honest with a friend you're sleeping with. If you know they're falling in love with you - and you don't feel the same - set them straight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSince you've already got trust between you why not get up to some hot sex-perimentation you wouldn't normally try? Go on, they're a friend so don't be slow in coming forward. Ask if there's something they've always wanted to do. </p>\n<p>\nThis is the perfect time to share something like a steamy shower where you sensually lather each other up. Then you can take turns satisfying each other with oral pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Tip:</b> Take a cushion into the shower to kneel on when you're giving oral sex (mind you, a cushion you don't mind getting soaked). </p>\n<p>\nAs the water cascades down you'll both love the sensations of having oral fun under a shower. Have two big warm towels ready to dry each other off with. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nNow you know loads more about each other's likes and dislikes having got playful in the shower. Take that knowledge into the bedroom for more sex-ploration. Why not ask them to keep still while you gently run a sex toy up and down their body to give them lovely sensations. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: friends + fringe benefits = having fun (if you both know where you stand)! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Test Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people who have flings-with-friends are hoping for a relationship too? </p>\n<p>\nA) 8% </p>\n<p>\nB) 38% </p>\n<p>\nC) 68% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - 8% of people who sleep with a friend say they're also hoping for romance. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Loved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Sarah Harding and Tom Crane </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nStunning Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding looks like she's sorting out her personal problems as well as her broken engagement with DJ Tom Crane.

They care more about a guy's personality - plus his sex-techniques that'll satisfy every time. </p>\n<p>\nBut try telling that to a 'smaller' man - it takes loads of encouragement for them to believe it. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The Size Statistics:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrossing the Channel there are 'size stats' from French research out this week. The beret-clad boffins found the average erect penis is between 12.8 - 14.5 cm [5 - 5.7 inches]. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's smaller than this it doesn't mean he can't 'live it large' in the bedroom with many top tips below. </p>\n<p>\nFirst a quick question: Are you a \"grower\" or \"shower\"? Many smaller men when flaccid [non-erect] actually grow 100 per cent when erect. Many larger men when flaccid are likely to grow by only 75 per cent when erect. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.8:</b> No Academy student should ever ridicule a man's size - such remarks can scar him for life. If a woman ridicules your size she's not worth your time. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* The Americans have a saying \"a diamond's better than a brick\" - so a 'smaller' man should always be confident about giving pleasure in other ways. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Remember that some [not all] well-endowed men have no sexual finesse in bed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* It's crucial a man sees himself as a complete man - not just a man with a certain-sized penis. He's far more than his penis size! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Confidence is highly attractive. So the smaller man that's confident generally - and about his sex techniques - will satisfy his partner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* The average length of a woman's vagina when aroused is about 10 cm [4 inches]. So it doesn't take as much length to satisfy her as men think. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* So-called Small Penis Syndrome - or 'locker room syndrome' - is more common in men of average size. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Despite the 'averages' there's huge variation amongst men. The famous Masters and Johnson's research team measured hundreds of penises - the longest non-erect one was 5.5 inches long. The shortest was just over 2 inches long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* A 'smaller' man should aim to be the \"King of foreplay\" to thrill his partner. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework [and this applies to any couple not just a man on the smaller side!]: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBecome the King of Foreplay by confidently asking her what she'd like you to do. As you kiss ask what kind of touch she'd like on her breasts, etc. </p>\n<p>\nLearn to use your fingertips wisely  vary between gentle strokes, circular movements, swishing back and forth, and gentle pinches. Keep asking what feels best. </p>\n<p>\nDitto your tongue and lips - try licking, flicking, sucking and circular movements with your tongue. </p>\n<p>\nCompletely spoil her by kissing, licking and touching all over her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe can encourage him to become the King of foreplay: if you feel shy asking for what you want when cuddling take his hands and move them to your fave erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nKeeping your hand on top of his, gently move it back and forth over these showing the type of touch you like. </p>\n<p>\nTake his finger between your lips and suck it the way you'd like him to apply pressure to your fave zones like your nipples. </p>\n<p>\nYou'll really turn him on if you get the courage up to whisper detailed instructions of what feels best as you get nearer to climax. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Foreplay techniques + confidence = a great lover! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of women report being happy/satisfied with their partner's penis size - </p>\n<p>\nA) 5% </p>\n<p>\nB) 85% </p>\n<p>\nC) 25% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 85 per cent of women are perfectly satisfied by their partner's size. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>George Clooney and Stacy Keibler </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe big question on Tinseltown's lips is whether gorgeous George Clooney has met his match in stunning wrestler Stacy Keibler. </p>\n<p>\nThe statuesque blonde would be wise to treat it like a wrestling match - going in with a game plan if she wants to beat his reputed phobia of commitment. </p>\n<p>\nIf you're with a man that's shy of committing let your confident independent side shine through.

This sends the \"Yawn Factor\" in the bedroom sky high. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhy do couples do this? Like most things in their relationship their sex position simply becomes a habit. For instance, it's Friday night and he's on his way home - he thinks to himself, \"Ah, it's sex night, that means a couple brews and Spoons position before bedtime.\" Mind you, she's probably thinking the same. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNothing wrong with 'comfortable' sex in a long-term relationship - but without occasional changes it's a passion killer. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Inwardly many partners feel shy about suggesting a new position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Or they don't want to upset their partner by suggesting a new one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Couples don't realise it's fairly easy to move into another position from their tried-and-tested one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*If they don't like a new position they can go back to the old one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*It's okay to take time after being in one position to pause for more foreplay - it might lead into trying a second position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No. 7: You don't have to stay in one position from the start of a sex-session to the finish. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nYour Hot Homework: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Try one of the following suggestions:</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n1/ Let's begin with a simple sex-periment - begin in classic Missionary position  he lies on top of her. Then he shifts his weight off of her, moving onto his side and facing her. This frees her to move onto her side but with her back to him. As easy as that you're now in Spoons position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n2/ Try The Cradle position  she's on top, lying chest-against-chest with him. She draws her legs up underneath her so her knees are bent. It's called the Cradle because it's as if she's now cradling him with her body. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis is perfect for slow and sensual moving and allows you two lots of touching and kissing. Some women may need to reach under and cradle his bottom to steady them if his thrusting intensifies. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n3/ Or experiment with the Lovers' Embrace position. You can easily move into this from The Cradle [above] - you both gently ease sideways. Or from Spoons - she simply turns around to face him. Or move into it from Missionary. All you do is lie on your sides facing each other, embracing. She lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy spice-it-up tip: To vary sensations she moves her leg further up or closes it back down more tightly on his leg. This varies the pressure you both feel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFirst reassure your partner you enjoy what you do together - but that you want to tempt them into </p>\n<p>\none of these new positions. Be confident that it's going to be fun. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A positive attitude + A new position = Fun sex! </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nQ: In one survey how many women said they could find their elusive G-spot - was it: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA/ 56% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nB/ 16% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nC/ 6% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer: </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A/ - 56% said they have a sensitive area on the front wall of the vagina </p>\n<p>\npopularly known as the G-spot.

Most people have a few quirks or kinks they secretly wonder about. Often these aren't mentioned until they build trust with their partner. Obviously they don't want to be laughed at or to shock their partner. </p>\n<p>\nAs far as I'm concerned - as long it is legal - what you as consenting adults discuss trying is your business. </p>\n<p>\nThe most common kinky things partners ask to try include: Being blindfolded, a bit of spanking, tying up, and dressing in role-play outfits. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 6</b>: Students should never feel pressured to go beyond the 'kink-level' they feel happy with! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\nIf your partner raises kinky sex-play (or you want to raise it with them) try these: </p>\n<p>\n*Be clear exactly what's meant. The word \"bondage\" might be mentioned and all they mean is getting fur-lined handcuffs from the high street adult shop. They don't mean sticking you in a dungeon! </p>\n<p>\n*Because some partners will panic at words like \"bondage\" think carefully how you describe the thing you want to try... so take the fright-factor out. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll boost your confidence if you stick to some fantasy-chat first. It's fun and sexy and you can sound out how far you two might want to go. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll make you both feel secure reassuring each other this is \"special occasion sex\". You're not going to have to 'swing from chandeliers' every time you have sex. </p>\n<p>\n*If you do anything like handcuffing each other remember it's no joke to leave someone handcuffed (or tied up). Just don't do it! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's take the handcuffs scenario - invest in some from an adult shop. Or spare your blushes and order them online. Then experiment on each other. </p>\n<p>\nYou can tease the person who's handcuffed by kissing them all over and even \"tormenting\" them with an ice cube held between your lips. Trace a cold line over their erogenous zones only to be warmed up with a trail of lovely warm kisses afterwards. </p>\n<p>\nOr while they're \"captive\" turn it into a hot fantasy where you're taking them away to be kept as your sexy prisoner. Have fun with banter along these lines - or any other scenario that you two conjure up. </p>\n<p>\nHeighten the teasing by using their favourite sex toy on them while they're handcuffed.

But people still lack confidence about getting dressed up in sexy gear - particularly some of the fetish gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's understandable, no one wants to look foolish, but you shouldn't underestimate the visual impact of wearing sexy things. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips for sizzling in sexy gear: </p>\n<p>\n* When you're with someone new don't slip into something super-kinky - they might feel a bit intimidated. </p>\n<p>\n* Add in sexy gear one step at a time. </p>\n<p>\n* Suggest shopping together to get the balance right - choose anything from sexy-lite to full-on-fetish. </p>\n<p>\n* If you're going to surprise your partner with a hot new outfit think about the things they mention in their fantasies. Do they talk about thigh-high, black patent lace-up boots or little floral dresses? Let those things guide your choices. </p>\n<p>\n* Beware of overdoing it. Sexy stilettos and a short skirt might look amazing. But if you also wear a lace-up basque it might be OTT - you can have too much of a good thing! </p>\n<p>\n* You can get lots of cheap n' cheerful gear or one 'investment' piece, e.g., a gorgeous hand-made basque. Is your partner going to want to have fun ripping it off - like in a bodice-ripping fantasy? Maybe go for the cheap n' cheerful stuff! </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought something sexy to wear - practice flaunting yourself in it on your own. That helps banish feelings that you look silly. Gradually you'll think, Hmmm, I look pretty hot! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 5:</b> Students should never embarrass a partner who's attempted to dress-up for them. You could 'scar' them permanently by telling them they look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Nearly 10% of people say it'd turn them on if their partner dressed up in a uniform. Playing 'doctors and nurses' has never been so much fun now you can pick up these outfits from adult shops. </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought an outfit have some fun with a little bit of role-play. </p>\n<p>\n* If you both enjoy sexy dressing-up occasionally go to costume hire shops for some adventurous ideas. </p>\n<p>\n* There is loads of fun gear for men - he might end up strutting around the bedroom in a black leather, studded man's thong. </p>\n<p>\n* If, as a woman, you're not happy about your legs stilettos and high-heeled boots lengthen them - and make you feel super sexy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe next time you two are 'in the mood' let your partner know you'd like to try a bit of dressing up. Start gently saying something like \"I've fantasised about you wearing old-fashioned stockings and suspenders.\" </p>\n<p>\nThis doesn't feel threatening to them and can plant the beginning of some great ideas. Have fun with it and ask her/him what they think of this - and if they've ever wanted to wear kinky gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet creative with things you already have that could work well as sexy gear.

Heaven knows how many single women - who don't have the trust of a long-term relationship - turn out the lights too! </p>\n<p>\nWhen it came to weight issues the stats were worse - a massive 75 per cent felt overweight. Sadly women think men will heads for the hills at the glimpse of a bulge. </p>\n<p>\nBut it doesn't stop there as now the fellas have body-image issues too. So the Academy aims to banish body hang-ups  men's and women's - from the bedroom. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips to boost body confidence - </p>\n<p>\n* Daily remind yourself you're more than what your body looks like - focus on your top personality traits - e.g. you're funny, kind, caring, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Take charge of negative thoughts about your body. Tell yourself nobody's perfect, no one cares about lumps and bumps, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Face reality: do you want to waste time wishing you had a smaller bum or bigger breasts OR get smart and put your energies into enjoying life - including your sex life? </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Choose your sexiest attribute - maybe your naughty smile or cheeky glint in your eye etc. Value these special lovely little things - and flash that smile. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Buy things that accentuate your good attributes. Be proud to flaunt those - whether it's your breasts, bottom, legs, shoulders etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* If you genuinely have excess weight do something FUN to get fit, e.g., take some sensual Latin American dance classes. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 4:</b> Each day students should close their eyes for a few moments and visualise themselves as a Sex Goddess or Sex God.

This helps you lose inhibitions - and worries about your body - since you'll feel confident doing your signature technique. </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're fab at kissing and also pretty good at giving oral sex. Why not devise your very own oral technique that uses your snogging skills? </p>\n<p>\nFor instance if you're great at French kissing apply those techniques 'down below'. You'll have your partner gasping for more - all they'll notice is how great you make them feel. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your technique + extra effort = your signature sex technique! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people feel too embarrassed to talk about sex - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 91% </p>\n<p>\nB) 31% </p>\n<p>\nC) 1% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is B) - a large survey found 31% of people are too embarrassed to talk about sex even with a partner.

And only about 15 per cent climax regularly. Those statistics equal a whole load of disappointment! But we can change this today. </p>\n<p>\nHere are some pointers every good student should learn - the first section is for the girls (but the guys should take a peak): </p>\n<p>\n* Reject thoughts that you'll \"never climax\" - it's easy to slip into a negative mindset when you've never climaxed with a man. </p>\n<p>\n*Even if you're with a partner where it's never happened, tell yourself \"I'm going to start afresh and be positive - it can happen if I relax about it!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n*Women should know how their body works. The best way forward is letting your fingers do the walking through self-pleasure. Men are masters of this - high time women became the mistresses of their bodies too. </p>\n<p>\n*Self-pleasure arms you with knowledge you then share with a partner. </p>\n<p>\n*Relax in a warm bath, the shower, or in bed with the lights down low. Maybe light a candle, put on some mood music and explore your body. </p>\n<p>\n*Share the sensations you discover with him the next time you're together. </p>\n<p>\nAnd for the guys: </p>\n<p>\n*Sorry guys, you may think you're Mr. Lover-man but what you think works may not work for her! </p>\n<p>\n* Help her relax and tell her to take her time. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask her what you can do to help bring her along. </p>\n<p>\n*She might feel embarrassed because it takes time to climax but reassurance will go a long way. </p>\n<p>\n*Really listen to her suggestions - hopefully she knows what works for her - she just needs to share it. </p>\n<p>\n*Don't get stressed-out if it takes some time getting to know what works for her. Treat it as sex-perimentation! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 3:</b> Students shouldn't fake orgasms - it seems okay when you don't want to \"hurt his feelings\" because you're tired and it's just not going to happen. But in the long run honesty's best. There's nothing wrong with enjoying sex-play knowing you're too tired for it to end in a climax. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet started with lashings of foreplay for her. Take your time showering her with kisses. Definitely kiss around the back of her neck and ears - unless she's supersensitive this is oh-oh-heavenly. </p>\n<p>\nStroke her lightly with your fingers - you build more sexual tension swirling them gently all over her body. Build to a firmer touch checking that she wants it. </p>\n<p>\nPretend you're her \"sex doctor\" discovering what makes her \"feel better\". Turning exploring her body into foreplay. Keep asking her what feels good and where. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you're both ready for full sex let her select the position - all students should check out my recommendation below. Give her \"permission\" to take charge of the action. Remember you can always have your pleasure once she has hers! </p>\n<p>\nThe must-know equation: understanding your body + sharing that knowledge = climax guaranteed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: By the time a couple's been together two years how much less sex do they have then when they first met? Is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 10% less sex </p>\n<p>\nB) 90% less sex </p>\n<p>\nC) 50% less sex </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is C) - they have half as much sex as when they were in the hot honeymoon phase! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSometimes a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do in the name of love! </p>\n<p>\nThe Hoff's girlfriend Hayden Roberts quit her job behind Debenham's makeup counter because bosses wouldn't give her enough time off to spend with David. It must've been makeup brushes at dawn as she stood up for her love. </p>\n<p>\nIn this case she's got her priorities right because sometimes love has to come first. I hear from too many women with bitter regrets having put their careers first. </p>\n<p>\nYou've got to look at the circumstances and sometimes they're so unique you need to make tough decisions. </p>\n<p>\nHow many Hollywood hunks - even the ageing ones - is Haley going to meet? And heck the Hoff looks like fun now he's cleaned up his act! </p>\n<p>\nIf things ever go pear-shaped and Haley doesn't get her happy-ever-after with the Hoff she's smart enough to know that there are other make-up counters and department stores - and men - out there. Food for thought if you find yourself weighing up the pros and cons of whether someone's worth making sacrifices for. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The CAT</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe Coital Alignment Technique (or Clitoral Alignment Technique as some call it) is the perfect choice this week  it's simple yet almost guaranteed to give her a climax. </p>\n<p>\nShe can either be on top or the bottom - but if she has difficulty climaxing I recommend she goes on top. He lies flat on the bed, her on top - sort of a \"reversed\" missionary position. She can have her legs inside his or outside of his. </p>\n<p>\nHaving them inside his legs squeezes his penis [edit, manhood?] fairly tightly so she should be careful how much pressure she uses. She then shimmies a couple centimetres up his pelvis so that her pubic bone rubs against his pubic bone. </p>\n<p>\nHe can reach around her hips and hold her in place - for a little added pleasure he can squeeze her buttocks gently. She controls the action using small circular or rocking movements. </p>\n<p>\nThe CAT allows her full control of the sensations she gets. It also slows him down so he doesn't climax too quickly allowing her to get the right stimulation to climax. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's a bit lazy he can have a rest while she goes on top and takes over! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>.

A whopping 94 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women confess to them... the rest are fibbing saying they don't have them. </p>\n<p>\nSo today's lesson is all about fantasy-chat to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nTiming's crucial - if your partner's just confessed undying love it's not the best time to mention your kinky bondage fantasy. But in the middle of fun foreplay? Definitely ask if they have \"naughty thoughts\" about secret desires. Using words like \"naughty thoughts\" is gentler than diving-in asking about fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nUse what you're already doing to kickstart fantasy-chat. If you're gently rubbing massage oil on them describe lying on a tropical beach and they're a sexy stranger who comes over to flirt. They begin rubbing suntan oil into you - you end up slipping off for amazing sex. Hopefully such chat will get your partner in the mood for sharing their fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nVariety's the spice of life - don't always describe the same scenario as that can get boring. The whole point of fantasy-sharing is roaming into fresh territory. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 2:</b> Students shouldn't upset a partner by describing fantasies of sex with their fave celeb or a hot fantasy about your neighbour! No, no, a 1000 times no - it's very bad bedroom manners. Your partner should feature prominently in your fantasies - at least the ones you share with them. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise. </p>\n<p>\nA healthy fantasy life has benefits: </p>\n<p>\n* It helps you escape sexual boredom </p>\n<p>\n* You get double the pleasure - you share your secret fantasies and they share theirs </p>\n<p>\n* When your partner's away fantasy-chat makes phone-sex more fun </p>\n<p>\n* In your private fantasies you can be with anyone - even people you'll never meet like your favourite celeb </p>\n<p>\n* Sharing fantasies gives you two fresh ideas to try - like some role-play </p>\n<p>\n* It's free! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge  when feeling confident to share your fantasy, describe one that boosts your partner's sexual confidence. </p>\n<p>\nToday's homework is to dream one up ahead of time - then when you're next in bed together whisper, e.g., \"You're so gorgeous I fantasise I'm a photographer and you're a model. I chat you up and start undressing you.\" This type of fantasy makes them feel fab - and that's the point. </p>\n<p>\nOne of you is probably more confident so by all means \"go first\" describing your fantasy. But emphasise you really want to hear theirs. Turn it into a game where you have to guess their fantasy. This can reveal all sorts of juicy stuff to chat about. </p>\n<p>\nAnother great game is taking turns deciding the next twist in a fantasy scenario. E.g. you start by describing how you get lost and go into a bar to ask directions. </p>\n<p>\nNo prize for guessing there's a really sexy stranger (who looks like your partner - remember your manners!) sitting at the bar who starts chatting you up. Now your partner says what happens next, and so on. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your fantasies + their fantasies = endless fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many under-30s have had sex with a friend - in other words \"friends with fringe benefits\"- is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 66 % </p>\n<p>\nB) 6 % </p>\n<p>\nC) 36 % </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A) - one study found a whopping two thirds of under-30s has been more-than-friendly with a friend! The 50+ generation's at it too, with nine per cent confessing to sex with a friend recently. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nKate Moss has joined new hubby Jamie Hince on tour Down Under. Like most newlyweds smack in the middle of the honeymoon phase they can't bear to be apart. But it's the transition from hot honeymoon phase to long-term love - with all its ups and downs, that's tricky. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you feel the fizz and fun fading that's when you should show a little extra love, attention and affection. </p>\n<p>\nDon't neglect each other but be realistic about finding a balance between what you once had - complete 'hot-ness'. And something lasting - a loving warmth where you occasionally turn up the heat! </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Strip Search</b> </p>\n<p>\nPerfect to try after the fantasy lesson above. Pretend he's a detective and she's a sexy suspect who needs searching. She leans against a wall, in a standing position, her back to him. </p>\n<p>\nHe enters from behind - leaning a hand against the wall for support or wrapping his arms around her waist to hold her tight. </p>\n<p>\nShe should keep her high heels on - it's sexy and it makes it easier for him to start the action. </p>\n<p>\nDouble her sensations by nuzzling the back of her neck as he gently moves. Plus he can 'search' her with his free hand roaming her body. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE.</a> </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>Sex Lessons: Week 1 </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>My Partner Isn't Interested in Sex</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt's NOT a nice feeling when your partner turns down sex. Inside you get a bit paranoid thinking: \"Am I a sex maniac, wanting too much?\" Or \"Don't they fancy me anymore?\" </p>\n<p>\nWomen are particularly bad about blaming themselves when he loses interest. Whereas the fellas are less worried about blame - they just want to sort out more sex! </p>\n<p>\nAcademy rule No. 1: Don't point the finger of blame for lack of sex at yourself or your partner. You're in this together, you'll sort it together. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist of passion-killing culprits every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n* Problems in your relationship (at each other's throats and you won't be at it!) </p>\n<p>\n* Trouble at work/financial worries </p>\n<p>\n* Not enough sleep or time together (a good chance the Beckham's are experiencing this one) </p>\n<p>\n* Too many late nights including too much booze and cigs </p>\n<p>\n* Boredom with the same old sex and/or feeling shy about trying new things </p>\n<p>\n* Medical problems and/or side-effects of prescription medication </p>\n<p>\n* Stress, anxiety and/or depression (face it, when you're down you don't feel sexy) </p>\n<p>\n* Erectile difficulties for the man meaning he avoids sex </p>\n<p>\nMost of these affect the way you feel and think i.e. your brain action. Research shows how powerfully our brains affect sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\nPut a hot, naked woman in front of a depressed man and his brain won't switch on his arousal centre. What hope has his wife of five, ten, or more, years got? </p>\n<h3>\nHot &amp; Helpful Homework: </h3>\n<p>\nIt's time for applying your new knowledge - thoroughly examine the checklist and get stuck in with the main culprit. If a number of these are affecting your sex life, focus on changing one at a time. </p>\n<p>\nStudy example: Let's say you're having lots of arguments plus partying too much at weekends - ending up hungover. </p>\n<p>\nWhen calm, agree with each other that the arguing must stop. Then look at what starts arguments (Household chores? Money?) and work out solutions together. </p>\n<p>\nBe the first to be affectionate and loving to your partner despite the rows. Making these efforts will have big payoffs. </p>\n<p>\nThinking of our example - arguments and partying  next knock excess drinking on the head. A hangover on a Sunday morning doesn't lead to Sunday afternoon delight! Agree a drinks limit and help each other stick to it. </p>\n<p>\nWhen things are better, recharge the spark. Make regular time for each other, get cosy on the settee, and whisper in their ear how much you miss that \"thing\" they do best in bed. </p>\n<p>\nTease them a little, let your fingertips gently run over their erogenous zones, and keep up the sexy banter. Full sex should be back on the agenda soon. But consult your GP about ongoing health issues that might affect desire. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many couples now regularly use oral sex to guarantee the woman's satisfaction - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 45% </p>\n<p>\nB) 20% </p>\n<p>\nC) 69% </p>\n<p>\nA: The correct answer is B. Twenty per cent of men in a relationship now use oral sex to make sure their partner has a good time between the sheets - just what the doctor ordered! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSo Brad and Angelina are getting hitched six years and six children into their relationship. Is it a case of better late than never? </p>\n<p>\nSadly it's not great news for the two most gorgeous celebrities to grace our good earth. Relationship research shows couples that leave getting married longer than 3 1/2 years are pretty much doomed. </p>\n<p>\nAny why? Because leaving it that long suggests one of them's dragged their feet about fully committing¿ whether it's her Jimmy Choo-clad feet daintily dodging the aisle we may never know. </p>\n<p>\nJust beware the partner who keeps putting off full commitment. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight:</b> <b>The Cow Girl</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHave loads of fun with this position where the girl's on top. He lies flat on his back and she straddles him, facing him. A perfect position for a 'boob-man' as he has great access to his partner's and can caress her during sex. </p>\n<p>\nShe gently glides up and down as passion builds. He steadies the action by holding her hips. This is a perfect position for her to control the pace of things. Plus if she has low-body confidence a dimmer switch or candles will provide subtle lighting. </p>\n<p>\nRiding off into the sunset takes on a new meaning! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>.

as Jemma Webb loses battle with cancer on her big day","byline":"By JOHN COLES","timestamp":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 15:01:29 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nA TRAGIC cancer sufferer died just 90 minutes before she was due to marry her fianc&#233;. </p>\n<p>\nJemma Webb, 32, planned to wed sweetheart Alex Bradford next month but the date was brought forward as her condition worsened. </p>\n<p>\nThey were due to tie the knot at 4.30pm last Saturday  but she passed away at 3pm. </p>\n<p>\nHer devastated fiance and parents yesterday paid tribute to Jemma, who inspired many other women to fight ovarian cancer. </p>\n<p>\nAlex, 30, added: \"On the day she was obviously excited and I was too. </p>\n<p>\n\"But by 2pm she got worse and within an hour she had passed away. </p>\n<p>\n\"She just kept herself together all through the illness. Some people give up, but she always thought she was going to beat it. </p>\n<p>\n\"Jemma may have had cancer, but cancer never had Jemma. Everyone was in awe for what she did and how she handled the cancer.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJemma, of Exeter, Devon, first displayed symptoms in 2008 and started what was to be four years of chemotherapy in February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nShe worked with Alex at EDF Energy in Exeter and they became an item just nine months before her death. </p>\n<p>\nHeartbroken Alex said he had no idea she had cancer when they first got together. </p>\n<p>\nHe explained: \"I didn't know she was ill, you wouldn't. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was just a normal relationship as you could imagine to start with, but then two months in the cancer spread to her liver and her lungs and I knew then that I had to be there for her. </p>\n<p>\n\"But I loved her  it was as simple as that, so it was never really a decision.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlex proposed in January and the wedding was set for April 18 at Colehayes Park, a Grade II listed Georgian mansion in Dartmoor National Park. </p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Forward</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nBut on March 16 the couple decided to bring the date forward to the following day because Jemma's health was deteriorating. </p>\n<p>\nThey arranged for a special licence for a registrar to come to the family home and conduct the ceremony at 4.30pm on March 17. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jemma died at 3pm with Alex and her family at her bedside. </p>\n<p>\nMum Janet said her daughter worked hard to raise the profile of the Eve Appeal, which raises money for research into women's cancer. </p>\n<p>\nJanet also told how Jemma also tackled the Great West Run, Birmingham Half Marathon, and even took part in the Race for Life the weekend after she had undergone chemotherapy. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"She was inspirational  she carried on as if there was going to be every tomorrow. </p>\n<p>\n\"She was completely wiped out after the Race for Life but she was determined to do it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe added: \"She touched everyone she came in contact with and she lived life to the full and never gave up. </p>\n<p>\n\"She was determined to get across the message to younger women about the dangers of ovarian cancer, which they call the silent killer. </p>\n<p>\n\"We cared for her at home but it wasn't really care because she did it herself, she was very independent.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDad Bob added: \"She was absolutely unique. </p>\n<p>\n\"The week she died I helped her do her bedroom  she was always looking forward and never back. </p>\n<p>\n\"She never once let her dress drop, she never once let her make up drop, she never let her hair go silly, she never felt sorry for herself and always thought of other people before herself.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"At her funeral there was about four times the church outside and inside, they had to do it by a loudspeaker.\"\n</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n<u><b>Inspiration</b></u>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nJemma had proven an inspiration to many women and her campaign for the Eve Appeal gynaecological cancer research charity was widely praised. </p>\n<p>\nThe charity said she had helped get the message to thousands of women. </p>\n<p>\nLiz Engel, of the Eve Appeal, said: \"I first came into contact with Jemma in 2009 when she wrote to me about her illness and was concerned that most of the people she knew were not aware of the risks or symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. </p>\n<p>\n\"Despite living with the worry and uncertainty of her diagnosis she was unwavering in her determination to help us to reach others, and particularly younger women like herself. </p>\n<p>\n\"There must have been days when she just didn't feel like it but whenever we asked her she would cheerfully agree.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJemma's funeral was on Tuesday, March 27. </p>\n<p>\nShe was treated for ovarian cancer after her diagnosis in 2008. </p>\n<p>\nJemma first noticed something was wrong in 2008. She underwent surgery and started what was to be four years of chemotherapy in February 2010. </p>\n<p>\nFor details on the charity visit www.eveappeal.org.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/music/4221247/Maccas-cancer-charity-gig-in-London.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Macca's cancer mission"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4199350/Sex-blamed-for-rise-in-mouth-cancer-cases.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Sex blamed for rise in mouth cancer cases"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/4192894/Ten-tips-to-help-you-quit-smoking.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Ten tips to help you quit smoking"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4194517/Danniella-Westbrook-talks-of-breast-cancer-scare.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Danniella Westbrook on breast cancer scare"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4192971/TOWIE-star-Lauren-Pope-I-just-wanted-my-ticking-timebomb-PIP-breast-implants-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I was terrified my PIP implants were a ticking timebomb.

It's incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n\"<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I'd try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n\"For breakfast, I'd have four slices of toast. For lunch I'd make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n\"Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I'd never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n\"Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: \"I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn't dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n\"So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges  you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n\"Worth more than &#163;3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class  purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n\"So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I'd done. It was the motivation I needed to carry on,\" she says. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Comparing myself month by month stunned me. My face was thinner and I could notice the difference in my waistline and arms.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I began looking forward to each month when the time came to take a picture and compare myself to the previous one.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola also joined women-only gym Curves and began working out twice a week. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"After the first year I'd lost five stone  down from 24st to 19st. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My meals changed completely to consist of a piece of toast for breakfast, a sandwich with two pieces of brown bread for lunch, fruit for a snack and meat with vegetables for dinner. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking at myself filled me with pride and the compliments I was receiving from friends and family were incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was determined this wasn't going to just be a fad diet phase  this was a new lifestyle for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the next three years she lost a further six stone, dropping to 13st 2lb. </p>\n<p>\nNicola says: \"Every woman wants to look their best in a photo. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I was ever tempted to have a take-away binge at the end of the month, I'd think about having my picture taken and it would put me off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd for shoe-mad Nicola there was only one way to mark her sensational new figure. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In January this year I splashed out on a beautiful pair of &#163;380 cream Jimmy Choo shoes to celebrate.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4210484/Ive-tried-61-different-diets-since-I-was-13.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"I've tried 61 different diets since I was 13"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Why we're all tee totally happy"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4201637/My-8-year-takeaway-binge-cost-25kand-my-unborn-babys-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My 8-year takeaway binge cost £25k...and my unborn baby's life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I'm proud to be UK average size 16.

Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

Try <b>Origins Never A Dull Moment</b> skin-brightening polisher with fruit extracts to help reveal a healthy glow, &#163;24 <i>(Origins)</i>. </p>\n<p>\nPut your feet up and slather on <b>Elemis Papaya Enzyme Peel</b>, &#163;28.60 <i>(Elemis counters)</i>.

You can layer under make-up or wear stand-alone. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are going out and want to appear more made up, try adding highlighter along the cheekbones, down the bridge of the nose and on the forehead  this gives a shimmering dewiness. </p>\n<p>\nYou can also place highlighter on the brow bone and under the arch of the brow to make your eyes appear brighter. </p>\n<p>\n<b>L'Oreal Lumi Magique Concealer</b>, &#163;8.49, <i>(Boots)</i> will help to brighten the eyes if you dab a small amount in the darkest areas, ie, underneath, and <b>Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer</b> in Chestnut, &#163;17, is great for darker skins.

I don't remember her ever saying, \"Wouldn't you be pretty if you did this or that?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe never focused on anything beyond wanting me to be presentable  just well-groomed.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe wanted me to take care of myself and be healthy. </p>\n<p>\nShe did ask one or two questions when I became a cheerleader at high school because I would be teasing my hair and wearing lipstick and eyeliner. </p>\n<p>\nI have an affiliation with a lot of countries. My mum was from Norway, my dad from Switzerland and my grandmother was Finnish, I have an Italian uncle, my first love was from South Africa and I was born in Texas.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am definitely a Texan girl. It is a culture you really love in a Latin sort of way. You taste it and hear it and the climate is hot  Texas hot.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI felt lucky that my parents were European  different  and opened the doors to let me see America is not the centre of the universe. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant that, with Bridget Jones, I could go to London and enjoy all things English that make the country so wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the making of the first film, I was even whistling songs by the Spice Girls.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut my mum was a realist about bringing up a teenage girl in America and kept a sense of humour. </p>\n<p>\nShe taught me that there are consequences for the things you say and do. She wanted me to grow up to be a good person. She and Dad liked simple and quiet. We had a very quiet house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy mum didn't talk about her childhood growing up in Norway during the Second World War. Her sisters talked but all had difficulty in putting into words what they had seen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey told about women giving birth in tunnels because there was no safe haven in any other structure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd about being lost from family members and not being sure if they were alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it was different for me, from my friends, growing up in a house where your mother was grateful just to have peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was one thing which was never acceptable, though.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I said: \"I don't know how to do that\", she would say: \"Learn.\" </p>\n<p>\nShe encouraged me to get a college education (Renee has an English degree) as something to fall back on if acting didn't work out.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved to Los Angeles on December 6, 1993, to be exact.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy attitude was that I was going to see where it took me.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been working in Texas from the age of 21, and been in a couple of films. But I had pretty well exhausted my learning opportunities. </p>\n<p>\nSo I took a grungy little one-bed apartment and was scared to death of the future. It was a leap of faith, I guess. </p>\n<p>\nI had some friends in LA who I had met on films but inside and emotionally, I felt alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make a living, I worked in a bar called The Three Cubs on a street called Vine, behind the Mobil gas station.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was an incredible place for a girl like me, who had lived in relatively safe places all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were crack deals being done on the street corners  so I would come back from the bar late at night then not be able to get out of my car to my apartment until the deals were completed.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked at the bar for two years. That was why Mum's guidance was so important and I stayed happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you can take care of yourself and see your friends, that is all that matters. </p>\n<p>\nThe main difference that the film Jerry Maguire made in my life was I could pay my rent and didn't have to waitress any more. It gave me freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew from the start that if I failed in acting, I always had my degree and could try a million things. I was not a \"look at me\" kind of girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had gravitated toward acting because I had a vivid imagination and daydreamed a lot. </p>\n<p>\nBut I did not daydream about being on a film set, winning an Oscar or having people know my name.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am grateful for the fact my mum never worried that I would compromise myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was always telling me, 'You don't sit down enough'  but she learned to trust my instincts.\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/3927676/Jerry-Maguire-actors-grown-up-to-be-a-big-star.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jerry Maguire actor's grown up to be a big star"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01473/Renee_Zellweger--5_1473337a.jpg","caption":"Different perspective ...

It was electric.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe former Emmerdale actress added: \"George is going to break some hearts. It was a three-hour scene, which will only be about a minute on screen. </p>\n<p>\n\"Suffice to say we know each other really well now. </p>\n<p>\n\"He is a little stud muffin and has such a gorgeous heart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRoxanne, who is 29, also used her single-episode appearance as saucy 17-year-old Shelby Dixon in the BBC1 drama to put some demons to bed from her own schooldays. </p>\n<p>\n<i>She says she used to feel physically sick at the thought of school after being tormented by bullies.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I hated it and would try to think up whatever excuses I could to get out of it. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wasn't popular. I was the ugly, hairy-armed mono-browed Greek girl, so the beautiful girls and gorgeous guys didn't want to sit with me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was such a geek, no wonder people laughed at me. Even my school uniform made me look like a misfit  my trousers were too short and my sleeves were too long. </p>\n<p>\n\"But I gave as good as I got because it was sink or swim. I might have been small and not tough physically, but I was quick-witted. </p>\n<p>\n\"Apparently this one group of girls, who used to tell me that I was nothing, that I was ugly, are still picking on me in forums and websites. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It actually felt like a massive relief to go back to 'school' and not have those feelings again. Waterloo Road was amazing, it was like the school years that I always wanted.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHer episode as Shelby is emotionally charged, featuring moving scenes of the teen's pain at the death of her mum. But the demanding storyline posed no problem for the star. </p>\n<p>\nShe found fame tackling the issue of domestic violence on Emmerdale as Jo Sugden, who was battered by husband Andy (Kelvin Fletcher). </p>\n<p>\nRoxanne said: \"I never play vanilla characters. I am always fighting, screaming, or crying. It is interesting and it keeps it fresh. </p>\n<p>\n\"It can be quite exhausting carrying all the emotions. I save everything up that I go through and put it into my character. It is like therapy really.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd she says the emotion used in Shelby's scenes of grief was real. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I trembled throughout Shelby's scenes. I felt I was getting the shakes from all the emotion. </p>\n<p>\n\"When she is talking about how much she is missing her mum, I applied that to when I lost my grandma at the same age. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is more raw if you can actually find a parallel in your own life.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRoxanne's own life has had violent moments, too. </p>\n<p>\nIn January thugs on a train threatened to set a vicious bull terrier on her, thrusting the snarling beast into her face. She said: \"It takes a lot to scare me  I've been through a lot. I haven't had a sugar-coated life. </p>\n<p>\n\"It did affect my confidence and for a few weeks I was constantly looking over my shoulder. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's horrible to say, but if anyone walked behind me, I would hesitate and wait for them to overtake as I don't like the feeling of someone close behind. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm not as confident as a lot of people make out and it really affected me because my life is not a Jeremy Kyle culture of arguments and fights. </p>\n<p>\n\"You shouldn't ever feel like your heart is racing or that you have a lump in your throat when you are on a train or bus. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I hope never to be faced with anything like that again.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd Roxanne  who also stars in Casualty this month  is still fuming that the yobs were not prosecuted despite being caught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I don't want to read in six months that a woman was mugged or a lad attacked or knifed on that train by the same gang. </p>\n<p>\n\"They were caught, put on bail for about a month then the police said that because there were three of them and one of me, my witness statement was too weak against theirs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am disappointed in how lenient the legal system is  it concerns me they are still out there.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut if the law cannot protect her, Roxanne has decided she can protect herself. </p>\n<p>\nThe tiny star hired Michael Jackson's British ex bodyguard, Matt Fiddes, to teach her self-defence and how to repel an attacker. </p>\n<p>\nShe revealed: \"It has really helped me build up my confidence. It was amazing to get a one-off with the man himself. He's about the size of five of me. </p>\n<p>\n\"At first he said, 'How small are you?', but then five minutes later he was saying, 'How tough are you?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It doesn't matter how big you are, how strong you are  it's that ability to feel that you have strength from somewhere inside. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's about channelling your energy and passion into a form that could save you, even if it is just to run away. Hopefully I won't ever have to use it, but if I did, I could.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAll of this has left Roxanne without much time for a romantic life. </p>\n<p>\nShe admits that she and pal Nikki Sanderson, the former Corrie actress, always joke that they will be spinsters until they are 90. </p>\n<p>\nShe laughed: \"We will be going on Take Me Out: The Pensioners' Special, because both of us never go clubbing, or have an office job where there is a social circle. </p>\n<p>\n\"Obviously I was working on Waterloo Road, but I couldn't really pick up a 15-year-old. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've got my eye on the door but I'm not on Match.com just yet. </p>\n<p>\n\"A few years ago I had my heart broken and I wasn't up to meeting anyone. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I met someone who was a good asset to my life and drama-free, then it would be fantastic, but I haven't. I don't trust many people. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm ridiculously picky but I do quite fancy the comedian John Bishop. He's gorgeous. </p>\n<p>\n\"I need to go to Liverpool and find myself a John Bishop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Roxanne's Waterloo Road episode screens on April 11. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<li></li>GEORGE says he was left really out of shape by his stint as Kyle Stack in Waterloo Road. </p>\n<p>\nHe had to launch into a gruelling training regime for his big-screen role in StreetDance 2. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"My fitness wasn't great after a year doing no dancing. I had to train Monday- to-Saturday for 12 hours a day for a month and a half. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was hard but fun. The choreographers didn't stop for anything.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nl.caroe@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Sexy side ...

For the moment all we can do is admire a strong effort from two men who deserve credit for pulling one off here. </p>\n<p>\nMany will argue, though, that it was not the match of the night. </p>\n<p>\nWrestling purists will point to a smashing WWE title match between CM Punk and Chris Jericho, which ended with Jericho tapping out to Punk's Anaconda Vice submission hold. </p>\n<p>\nThe two men complimented each other beautifully in the ring and told a great story of Punk getting revenge on Jericho's heel character. </p>\n<p>\nMost, though, I believe, would have given the match-of-the-night night honours to three men who are certified legends of their craft  and who redefined the nature of storytelling in a wrestling context. </p>\n<p>\nTriple H and Undertaker, with Shawn Michaels as a guest referee, pulled every trick in the book and every string of the heart to weave a tale worthy of the bard and leave every fan in Florida and those tuning in at home feeling as exhausted as each man looked. </p>\n<p>\nTriple H's vicious assault with a chair caused sympathetic ref Michaels to nearly stop the match. </p>\n<p>\nTo prevent this, Taker put HBK in the dreaded Hell's Gate before Hunter broke the move with a gimmicked sledgehammer to his opponent's head. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLater, Michaels would hit Sweet Chin Music, sending the Deadman into HHH's clutches for a Pedigree  only for Taker to kick out. </p>\n<p>\nThe tables were turned, with Undertaker using the move to punish HHH, and eventually a conflicted Michaels would count three after a tombstone. </p>\n<p>\nIt was an epic and the three men left arm in arm, completing their journey to the back with a three-way hug. </p>\n<p>\nIt was not seen on TV, but there is no doubt their biggest reception of all would have been behind the curtain. </p>\n<p>\nThe thing is, these three matches had to come through for WWE, because the first 60 minutes of this four-hour show were a disaster. </p>\n<p>\nIn their wisdom, WWE gave Sheamus and Daniel Bryan, two excellent workers who fans genuinely care about, just 18 seconds for a match which consisted of Bryan getting a kiss from his girlfriend and then a kick from his opponent. </p>\n<p>\nIt was an astonishing decision and a transparent virtual slap in the face to those who admire the talents of the Irishman and the American Dragon. </p>\n<p>\nKane pulled a shock win over Randy Orton and Big Show relieved Cody Rhodes of the intercontinental title in two mediocre, unmemorable matches before WWE allowed celebrity Maria Menounos to score a pin over women's champion Beth Phoenix in a tag match. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMenounos, we should point out, had been billed as having broken ribs and a fractured foot. This is hardly putting the shine on your division's mainstay, is it? </p>\n<p>\nFortunately, the big guns powered through. </p>\n<p>\nIn between, John Laurinaitis seized control of both Raw and Smackdown as his team downed Teddy Long's unit, largely thanks to Eve distracting Zack Ryder. </p>\n<p>\nDepending on your allegiance or preference, the night belonged to two legends defining an era, two workhorses putting on a clinic, or two charismatic stars ending a year-long feud in the middle of the ring. </p>\n<p>\nThanks to their efforts, we have this Mania down as the best in several years. </p>\n<p>\nWe award WrestleMania 28 a score of 8.5 out of 10. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"VICTORIOUS ...

'Why does it always have to be about you?', I would ask.</p>\n<p>At a time when City need everyone pulling in the same direction, he acted like a selfish spoilt brat.</p>\n<p>For most of the game he was ambling about the pitch looking like a man whose dog had just been run over.</p>\n<p>Then when it came to that second-half free-kick moment he turned even his own fans against him.</p>\n<p>City were struggling and running out of time when he chose to have a stand-up row with full-back Aleksandar Kolarov over who should take a free-kick.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, it was a moment that smacked of division in the camp.</p>\n<p>I have been on the pitch when similar things have happened.</p>\n<p>With Blackburn, David Batty and Graeme Le Saux went at it during a Champions League game at Spartak Moscow in 1995.</p>\n<p>Then at Newcastle when Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer went for each other in 2005  and they were big mates by the way.</p>\n<p>It sends out all the wrong messages.</p>\n<p>For City it was the low point of the season.</p>\n<p>Forget Balotelli's two goals. They needed a big strong performance from him on Saturday.</p>\n<p>They needed him to step up to the plate in the absence of Sergio Aguero and he didn't.</p>\n<p>To be fair, he was not alone. City were outfought and outplayed by Sunderland in every single department.</p>\n<p>Sunderland's Lee Cattermole bossed the midfield, while up front Nicklas Bendtner and Stephane Sessegnon had the beating of Vincent Kompany and Kolo Toure.</p>\n<p>And at the back, Matthew Kilgallon and Michael Turner had David Silva and Balotelli in their pockets for most of the game.</p>\n<p>Silva looks tired and shot. The rigours of a full Premier Leagues season have clearly taken their toll.</p>\n<p>The player who lit up this league in the first six months of the season is now a shadow of his former self. And so are City as a team.</p>\n<p>It seems the relentless pursuit of them by Manchester United has worn them down.</p>\n<p>I know what that's like as we had it at Blackburn in 1995  and just hung on to get home from United by a point.</p>\n<p>The pressure they applied was relentless but what you have to do in those situations is all stick together.</p>\n<p>You need to be a collective, determined force, ensuring that you will not crack.</p>\n<p>Despite City's late fightback, I saw none of those traits.</p>\n<p>It's all slipped through their fingers and, in Balotelli, you saw a man who simply did not want to grab it back.</p>\n<p><b>WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS</b> are a fantastic club.</p>\n<p>They have a great ground with a great atmosphere and to me they are a proper community football club.</p>\n<p>Yet I find myself with little sympathy for their plight right now as they fall headlong towards relegation.</p>\n<p>Their bungling in sacking Mick McCarthy and then scrabbling round for a replacement has undermined any chance they had of staying up.</p>\n<p>McCarthy got them up, kept them up and was their best chance of staying up.</p>\n<p>Terry Connor was on a hiding to nothing when they finally turned to him after failing to get their first, second and third targets.</p>\n<p>Despite their perilous position when he went, I still saw enough in the Wolves side under Mick to suggest they could get out of it.</p>\n<p>Not any more and those in the boardroom have only themselves to blame.</p>\n<p>My best wishes must go out to <b>STILIYAN PETROV</b> as he begins the biggest fight of his life after being diagnosed with acute leukaemia.</p>\n<p>In these past few weeks we have really seen how fragile life can be.</p>\n<p>A fit and happy footballer one minute and facing an awful scenario the next.</p>\n<p>We have also seen how football can rally round at times of trouble.</p>\n<p>The reception he received at Aston Villa on Saturday clearly made it a very emotional occasion for him and his family.</p>\n<p>It told him, yes, he's in a fight but also that he is not on his own.</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"SPAT ...

This lot have been fantastic. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've never felt there's been a problem. We just needed a bit of luck, if you like, and it would turn. We were fine.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nVan der Vaart fired Spurs ahead in the 19th minute before Gylfi Sigurdsson smashed the Swans level on 59 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nBut Adebayor sealed the points for Spurs with towering headers in the 73rd and 86th minutes. Redknapp, of course, is the odds-on favourite to become the next England manager, while Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers has emerged as one of candidates to succeed him at White Hart Lane. </p>\n<p>\nRedknapp said: \"What their manager has done for them is fantastic, I can't speak highly enough of them. If everybody looked at how they play, in youth teams, that's how you should play. </p>\n<p>\n\"He's got players from Torquay, Stockport, everywhere, and they play, pass the ball and take risks on the ball. They've come up against a better team here. But if you get kids and youth teams playing that way in this country, you'd have better technical players. </p>\n<p>\n\"Brendan is fantastic. Not just now, but when he was running the reserves at Chelsea. Frank Lampard snr and young Frank spoke highly of him. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Look at the way he's got Swansea playing. He will manage a big club one day for sure. </p>\n<p>\n\"And look what he's done with little Leon Britton. I had him at West Ham as a kid. He couldn't get a game at Sheffield United and was at Swansea when they almost went out the league. </p>\n<p>\n\"When they came back to 1-1 it was game on. They were having a good spell and I wondered if we'd run out of steam, that we couldn't keep it up. But we came good.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSwansea boss Rodgers has now seen his side lose two on the spin. </p>\n<p>\nBut he said: \"Some of our football against a top side was outstanding. We dominated for large parts of the game. </p>\n<p>\n\"The scoreline was harsh on us. But for a team that's been promoted, to come here and play like that was fantastic.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"HEAD BOY ...

Crucially the Gunners have to face Manchester City AND Chelsea. </p>\n<p>\nSpurs' run-in is a doddle by comparison, so there was a lot riding on this one. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRafael van der Vaart's Dutch of class had put Spurs ahead at the interval but Swansea levelled on 59 minutes through Gylfi Sigurdsson. </p>\n<p>\nBut just as the gloom appeared to be descending on a sunny afternoon for Spurs, Van der Vaart swung in a wonderful corner and Adebayor rose to head the hosts in front on 73 minutes. </p>\n<p>\nThen, four minutes from time, sub Aaron Lennon  whose every touch was cheered to the rafters  skinned Leon Britton, arrowed in a measured ball and Adebayor's head did the rest. </p>\n<p>\nUntil then, this was a battle between a club whose season promised so much and threatened to deliver so little and one whose season promised so little and has already delivered so much. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly a few weeks ago, Spurs harboured realistic title aspirations although they are far from finished in terms of securing Champions League football. </p>\n<p>\nNewly-promoted Swansea have won the nation's hearts and already secured survival in their debut Premier League campaign. </p>\n<p>\nBefore kick-off, these two sets of players had provided more entertainment this season than all the other top-flight teams put together. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a platform for high drama and while they did not deliver a classic, it was still enthralling. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSpurs should have been ahead after seven minutes, when Adebayor set up Van der Vaart. </p>\n<p>\nHis shot was destined for the bottom corner but came off Neil Taylor for a corner which, amazingly, referee Andre Marriner failed to spot. </p>\n<p>\nSeconds later, Wayne Routledge's 25-yard effort was just wide. </p>\n<p>\nSpurs No 2 Joe Jordan kept barking at Tottenham's frontline to keep pressing Swansea three- quarters up the pitch  and Redknapp admitted afterwards that was the gameplan. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd it worked wonders for the hosts on 19 minutes when Luka Modric spotted Bale's run behind Angel Rangel, the Welshman squared it and Van Der Vaart beat Michel Vorm in style. </p>\n<p>\nMoments later, Bale was in again on the left but Ashley Williams did well to clear ahead of Adebayor. </p>\n<p>\nVorm then saved Younes Kaboul's header off Van der Vaart's corner to keep Swansea in the game. </p>\n<p>\nSwans' best chance of the half came on 31 minutes when Sigurdsson crossed and Williams beat Kaboul but his header bounced over. Parker then blocked Sigurdsson's blast. </p>\n<p>\nAfter the restart, Swansea showed for 15 minutes that they pass the ball as well as anyone in the land. </p>\n<p>\nBrad Friedel produced the save of the match to push Sigurdsson's left-foot missile out for a corner. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam Gallas then ran across to thwart Swans' Danny Graham, who was bearing down on goal. </p>\n<p>\nSo it was no surprise when the visitors equalised after Routledge set up Sigurdsson to slam his volley in off the ground. </p>\n<p>\nVorm then produced a string of saves before Adebayor restored Spurs' lead and killed Swansea off. </p>\n<p>\nKaboul still found time to produce two wonderful blocks to deny Sigurdsson and then Sinclair late on as Rodgers' men showed dogged determination. </p>\n<p>\nRedknapp heaped praise on Rodgers for his work at Swansea afterwards, insisting the Northern Irishman's work should be replicated across the land. </p>\n<p>\nThe Spurs boss said: \"That is the way to play the game if you want to produce technical players. </p>\n<p>\n\"They have come up against a better team today but every youth coach in the country should go and watch them train and learn from them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSomething perhaps for the next England manager to look at closely. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM RATINGS </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN  RAFAEL VAN DER VAART (Tottenham) </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TOTTENHAM: </b>Friedel 7, Walker 6, Gallas 6, Kaboul 7, Assou-Ekotto 6 (Rose 5), Sandro 5 (Lennon 7), Parker 6, Modric 7, Van der Vaart 8 (Livermore 5), Adebayor 7, Bale 8.

While Andy Carroll was booed and abused for 78 minutes before storming down the tunnel after being subbed, Papiss Cisse's dream Toon start continues. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat a signing the Senegalese forward has been. The man eventually brought in to replace Carroll just seems to have the Midas touch in front of goal. A typical right place, right time merchant. </p>\n<p>\nHis double either side of half-time makes it seven league goals in seven games for the &#163;10million January arrival from Freiburg. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is two more than Liverpool's &#163;35m man has scored in 36 appearances! </p>\n<p>\nWhat has happened to the Carroll who was a hero on Tyneside during his time at the club remains a mystery. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe started well but faded badly  just like Liverpool. </p>\n<p>\nA happy homecoming this was not. Newcastle, though, loved every minute. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLevel on points with Chelsea with seven games to go, it is a scenario beyond any devout Geordie's wildest dreams.Their third win on the spin not only consolidates their top-six slot, it ensured Pardew remains bang on track for European football next season. </p>\n<p>\nThe job he has done at St James' Park continues to defy belief. It is as staggering as the slump Liverpool are in right now. </p>\n<p>\nPards has expertly moulded a team full of passion, drive, determination and quality. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThey defended superbly, the midfield controlled the show and the front three of Cisse, Demba Ba and Hatem Ben Arfa ran the Reds ragged. </p>\n<p>\nRemember, Pardew sent out his team minus inspirational, but crocked, skipper Fabricio Coloccini. The fact he was barely missed shows exactly how well Mike Williamson and James Perch performed. </p>\n<p>\nKenny Dalglish's Reds, now boasting six defeats from the last seven games, are in a slump which could have huge ramifications when owner John W Henry assesses the whole sorry mess. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was not as if Liverpool started badly. They had all the early chances and Carroll was putting himself about. </p>\n<p>\nJonjo Shelvey saw a shot deflected wide on three minutes before Martin Skrtel really should have headed home from a corner instead of heading over. </p>\n<p>\nThen came Carroll's moment to ensure he became a true April fool. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe big hitman had done all the hard work on nine minutes. He powerfully, and typically of his time in a black and white shirt, won the ball off Williamson before nipping it past Perch. All he had to do was stay on his feet as he rounded Tim Krul. The goal was gaping. </p>\n<p>\nBut instead he fell to the floor in what looked a ludicrous attempt to win a penalty and was booked for his efforts. </p>\n<p>\nKrul, who came through the ranks with Carroll, was furious and angrily confronted his old 'pal'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nPardew also gave him what for on the touchline soon after. And boos cascaded down from the stands. Welcome home, bonny lad. </p>\n<p>\nDalglish, never one to raise a massive smile, cut a frustrated figure. But you will not find much sympathy for him in Geordie land. </p>\n<p>\nEven so, on 14 minutes his strugglers should have been given a penalty. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJust moments after Krul had tipped a deflected Craig Bellamy cross on to the bar, the big Dutchman totally missed the ball from the resulting corner. </p>\n<p>\nIt hit Williamson and flicked off Carroll, only for Danny Simpson to arm it away from danger. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a penalty but not given by ref Martin Atkinson. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFive minutes later, the pain was increased as Cisse tucked in the opener. Ben Arfa, outstanding once again, whipped in a lovely cross and Cisse slipped in behind Skrtel to head home via a post. </p>\n<p>\nThe goal spurred on Newcastle and, once Carroll had headed over on 27 minutes, the Kop were always second-best. </p>\n<p>\nCisse should have doubled the lead five minutes before the break when he headed wide. Yet his deserved double came just before the hour mark. </p>\n<p>\nDanny Guthrie and Ben Arfa combined for a suspiciously offside- looking Cisse to round Pepe Reina before firing the ball home. </p>\n<p>\nThe game was up for the Kop  and on 83 minutes came the crowning glory. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nReina tangled with Perch before stupidly pushing his head into the defender's face. </p>\n<p>\nContact was minimal but Perch collapsed to the ground and, despite Reina's protests, the outcome was always going to be red. </p>\n<p>\nJose Enrique went in goal, much to the amusement of a packed St James' Park. Not that they needed anything else to laugh about. </p>\n<p>\nLiverpool and Carroll's sorry state, plus their own sustained Euro charge, has already provided enough smiles to last a lifetime. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM RATINGS </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN  HATEM BEN ARFA (Newcastle) </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>NEWCASTLE:</b> Krul 7, Simpson 6, Williamson 7, Perch 7, Gutierrez 7, Guthrie 7 (Gosling 5), Tiote 7, Cabaye 7, Ben Arfa 8 (Santon 5), Cisse 8 (Shola Ameobi 5), Ba 7.
