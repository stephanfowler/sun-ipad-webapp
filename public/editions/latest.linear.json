It's not helping.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe message was still not getting through yesterday  with hundreds of petrol stations forced to close as motorists drained them dry. </p>\n<p>\nSome queued for more than an hour to reach a pump  amid reports of fights between drivers. </p>\n<p>\nPolice shut some garages for fear of accidents as queuing drivers spilled on to busy roads. </p>\n<p>\nPetrol sales have soared 81 per cent and diesel 43 per cent since the crisis began. </p>\n<p>\nSales of jerry cans  which Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude urged motorists to fill  have rocketed by 500 per cent. </p>\n<p>\nIn Dorset yesterday there were long queues from dawn. By mid-morning garages in Weymouth and Christchurch had run dry  with some having sold three days worth of fuel in a few hours. Jason Babbe, 33, queued for an hour. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I saw an argument between a taxi driver and another motorist and other rows going on.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"As well as filling up their tanks people were filling up cans.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAn attendant at Texaco in Weymouth said: \"People are going mad. We've sold what we'd normally sell in three days in hours.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Devon, staff at Sainsbury's Alphington store had to shepherd cars into lines after claims of queue-jumping caused outrage. </p>\n<p>\nCharlie Bell said: \"Traffic is coming in from both directions. I am empty  but I wonder how many people are following the daft advice to keep topped up?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Wilmslow, Cheshire, there were claims of profiteering as one petrol station hiked its diesel price to 148.9p a litre. </p>\n<p>\nMum Fiona Barrett, 56, said: \"It seems extraordinary there can be diesel on sale at two stations half a mile apart with a 5p difference.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Chelsea, West London, firemen had to clean up a diesel spill when a van driver trying to cram as much in his tank as possible sent fuel spilling across a forecourt. </p>\n<p>\nAt Morrisons in Dukinfield, near Manchester, tempers boiled over  with one motorist yelling four-letter abuse at those queuing. One 70-year-old great grandma caught in a tailback said: \"The Government has a lot to answer for.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe AA yesterday said drivers queuing for pumps were actually wasting fuel. Waiting with an engine idling costs up to 3p a minute  so queuing for 45 minutes wastes around a litre of fuel. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday the Government continued to send out confused messages. </p>\n<p>\nTransport minister Mike Penning said: \"Don't queue  but if you've got half a tank, fill it up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey advised people to \"fill up when they can\"  and aim to keep tanks two thirds full. On Tuesday the Government advised us all to fill our tanks. </p>\n<p>\nThen on Wednesday Mr Maude suggested drivers should also have a jerry can of fuel in their garage. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHis advice was described as dangerous and illegal by fire chiefs. </p>\n<p>\nThe strike is being threatened by about 2,000 tanker drivers over pay and safety concerns. </p>\n<p>\nTalks between the Unite union and the seven employers in the dispute take place at the conciliation service Acas on Monday. Unite said: \"We want a negotiated settlement.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<li></li> <b>A WOMAN</b> suffered 40 per cent burns when petrol ignited as she was transferring it to containers in her kitchen in York, North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said.\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nk.schofield@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nFuel set to rise again<br></br>\n</h1>\n<p>\nBRITAIN'S panicked drivers were last night told that petrol prices are going even <b>HIGHER</b>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMotoring chiefs warned that wholesale prices on international markets had soared to a new record. This means pump prices are almost certain to rise by 2p per litre in the next ten days. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith the extra 2p, diesel will be averaging almost 150p per litre  nearly &#163;7 a gallon. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOfficial figures show motorists bought 3.1bn fewer litres last year compared to 2007. Diesel sales are up slightly, but petrol has plunged. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAA president Edmund King said: \"Some people are being priced out of fuel. People feel they just cannot afford to fill up.

Come and see, it just darted.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn less than a fortnight the singer's fans will be able to see Rihanna experiencing her closest encounter yet with aliens  in her big-screen debut in the sci-fi blockbuster Battleship. </p>\n<p>\nThe 12A movie, which also features Liam Neeson and rising star Taylor Kitsch, opens on April 11. </p>\n<p>\nIn it Rihanna plays an American navy gunner called Raikes, who takes on some scary-looking aliens. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter releasing six albums in just five years, winning five Grammys and scoring numerous hits with such songs as Umbrella and Only Girl (In the World), Rihanna has taken the leap into acting in her stride. </p>\n<p>\nShe claims she had been looking for the right part for a while  so perhaps it was her early interest in aliens which sealed the deal for her first major role. </p>\n<p>\nThe film tells the tale of a US naval crew's confrontation with aliens who are protected by minders called \"thugs\". </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking at a London hotel, the 24-year-old singer recalls the moment she went to meet the film's director, Peter Berg, for the first time. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I didn't know much about the part and I didn't even know about the meeting I was supposed to be going into. </p>\n<p>\n\"Pete walked right in and said, 'These are the thugs' and he was pointing to these alien characters and showing demos of them. </p>\n<p>\n\"There were tons of pictures of them on the wall. Every time he said it was a thug I was cracking up. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Not until the end of the meeting did I realise he was the director of the film and what the film was about.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He told me to say, 'I am going to get you, mother******' and he had me saying the craziest stuff right on the spot and he said, 'Yeah, I think you are perfect.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever Rihanna quickly discovered she was less than \"perfect\" for a military screen role. </p>\n<p>\nTo prepare for the part, she hired a soldier to help with her fitness training. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the Bajan beauty, who is known for her love of fashion and partying, soon discovered it did not fit in with her lifestyle. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"The soldier was definitely scary, scary, scary. It was intense but necessary. </p>\n<p>\n\"I didn't think of quitting on the film, but every minute of the training I was thinking of quitting. I was like, 'I need to get this guy out of my hotel room.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"When he came round I would hide my pink iPod and my high heels. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt guilty shopping when I was making this film.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs The Sun revealed last month, Rihanna had an early taste of army-style discipline in her youth as a member of the Barbados Cadet Corps. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I didn't want to be at school for schoolwork, that was boring. </p>\n<p>\n\"I wanted to join an organisation and everything else was kind of not my thing, so I joined the cadets. They had weapons.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nToday the wild-living star has a lot of respect for armed forces and the sacrifices they make. </p>\n<p>\nEven if she hadn't become famous, Rihanna doubts that she could have served her country. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A soldier? I don't know. That is, I mean, if I had to I definitely would  I have so much respect for soldiers. </p>\n<p>\n\"They dedicate their lives to saving other lives and saving their countries and a lot of times they don't even get recognised for it, even when they come back. Sometimes they don't have a place to go. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's really sad but they put themselves on the line out there and I admire them so, so much. </p>\n<p>\n\"It really takes a certain character and person with a certain discipline to be a soldier.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRihanna continues: \"In the movie my character is named Raikes and she's a bad-ass. She's really tough and she's one of the boys.\" </p>\n<p>\nAs to whether she enjoyed being a \"bad-ass\" she jokes: \"Definitely. It's like my everyday life.\" </p>\n<p>\nHowever, the regular routine of the film set was far from Rihanna's everyday life. </p>\n<p>\nThat usually involves jetting round the world  whereas staying put on location in Hawaii was very different. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'm used to getting on a plane every day or being in a different time zone every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"But on a film set you are just in one place for a long time. You start and end work every day at the same time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite the rigid routine Rihanna admits she was not well prepared for her first day of filming. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"The fear of the unknown is incredible. I didn't know what I was getting into. </p>\n<p>\n\"It was really scary and there was little me, just trying to get through everything, hoping they wouldn't come for me today. </p>\n<p>\n\"And then on the very first day it was 'Boom,' you are up and you have got lines.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe film was inspired by the popular children's game Battleships  though its popularity clearly has not spread to Rihanna's household. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Actually, I didn't even know of the game, because in Barbados it doesn't even exist.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily fans of her music need not worry that she is about to swap careers permanently. </p>\n<p>\nShe has every intention of getting back into the recording studio and says: \"Doing movies and getting into acting is something that I always wanted to try and I never knew whether I would like it, hate it or love it but I just wanted to try it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"It ended up being a really awesome experience. But I don't see why I can't do both acting and music.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>g.rollings@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4224321/Rihanna-rides-the-Tube-to-see-Drake-concert-in-thigh-high-leather-boots.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Rihanna sexes up the Tube"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4158773/Rihanna-news-Birthday-Cake-singer-opens-up-about-her-first-acting-role-in-new-film-Battleship-with-Liam-Neeson.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Rih-load"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4219014/Rihanna-wants-Ashton-in-UK.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Rihanna wants Ashton to move to UK for summer"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/music/4217329/Take-a-Luke-at-Rihanna-and-Chris-Martin.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Take a Luke at Rihanna and Chris Martin"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4215483/Rihannas-fling-with-Demi-Moores-ex-husband-Ashton-Kutcher.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Rihanna's fling with Demi Moore's ex"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4213728/Rihanna-is-a-good-girl-gone-bad-geisha-as-she-flips-bird-in-outfit.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Rihanna is a Good Girl Gone Bad geisha"}],"video":[{"uri":"w4ZGo0MzpIbhhnu18YOWPOKXhokjaodH","js":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=w4ZGo0MzpIbhhnu18YOWPOKXhokjaodH&deepLinkEmbedCode=w4ZGo0MzpIbhhnu18YOWPOKXhokjaodH\"></script>","caption":"STAR joins Liam Neeson and Taylor Kitsch in aquatic adventure movie"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF3012RIH2-5328_1480669a.jpg","caption":"Alien invasion fantasy ...

And even senior Tories were worried Mr Osborne and Prime Minister David Cameron are looking increasingly out of touch with the public. </p>\n<p>\nEx-leadership challenger David Davis warned the party's \"rich toff\" image could be as damaging to the Government as the sleaze scandals that battered John Major's administration. </p>\n<p>\nMr Davis, who grew up on a council estate, said: \"People look at the front bench and they see them all well-dressed, well turned out, well fed. And perhaps feel they're in a different world to them.\" Another of Mr Osborne's arguments for the Pasty Tax crumbled yesterday. He claimed he was closing a loophole left when ex-Chancellor Nigel Lawson put VAT on takeaway grub in 1984. </p>\n<p>\nBut a letter that emerged yesterday, written by Lord Lawson at the time, said: \"It does not apply to things like pies and pastries sold warm because they happen to be freshly baked.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<i>Mr Cameron's red face over his pasty blunder grew even redder yesterday. On Wednesday it emerged a shop at Leeds railway station, where he said he had enjoyed his last pasty, closed four years ago.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn a bid to correct the gaffe, a No10 spin doctor later said the PM actually bought it in Liverpool. But the claim was withdrawn yesterday after Mr Cameron said it was wrong. An aide said: \"There was no intention to mislead.

All the other parents I have spoken to feel the same.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nResident Ms Howard-Jones, 47, said that many families would love to live in a detached property close to the school in a picturesque avenue. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"What could be more delightful than the sound of children playing? It is for such a limited time, especially with our climate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe school is oversubscribed, with 273 on-time applications for 90 places last year. Only children living within 620 metres were given places. </p>\n<p>\nIt has recently had a &#163;1 million revamp and tries to make the most of its grounds for the benefit of the pupils. A new safety surface has recently replaced some of the grass, enabling children to use the space in all weathers. </p>\n<p>\nMr Purches, who has lived in his home for more than 30 years, said the children's noise was sometimes so loud that he and his wife could not have a conversation in their garden. </p>\n<p>\nHe said the play area, which used to be 85ft from his property, was now only 10ft from his house wall. </p>\n<p>\nMr Purches said he had no objection to the school, which two of his children attended, but was asking the staff and parents to remember that they were visitors to the area and to encourage the children to respect the school's neighbours. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It is a very polite notice. The last thing we want to do it to stop children enjoying themselves. We just don't want a lot of excessive screaming and shouting.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said he had written to the school's head teacher Inge Fey and governors several times over the years about various issues. </p>\n<p>\nHe had also asked Bristol City Council to install acoustic fencing but officers had replied saying that the noise level was appropriate for children aged four and five. </p>\n<p>\nCatherine Ball, chairwoman of the school's governors, said: \"Elmlea Infants' School is working hard to offer outstanding provision for Early Years children. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We are very disappointed that a local resident is objecting to our children using our land which is used as much needed play space that enhances our curriculum.

But the largely illiterate Bedia community have no other source of income. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTwo-year-old Sumit is encouraged by his family to play with cobras, carelessly wrapping them around his neck, as they expect him to continue the family tradition.. </p>\n<p>\nBudh said: \"I have educated all my sons and all my grandchildren go to school, but I will always teach them our ancient ways so we do not forget our heritage.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSnake charmers, once a symbol of the mystical Indian culture, have all but disappeared in recent years. </p>\n<p>\nThe new laws are to blame - anyone who owns a snake can face hefty fines and up to seven years in prison. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBudh added: \"For thousands of years we have earned our living by entertaining people with snakes but now we are left penniless. </p>\n<p>\n\"Earlier, we used to roam from village to village and do our shows, but now if the police see us performing they take us to jail. </p>\n<p>\n\"Before they banned us from performing, we could make a decent living - we could get our sons educated, our daughters married. Now it is very difficult.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSnake charmers used to perform on street corners, festivals and in the early days of Indian independence at international art festivals. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nArmed with a long gourd flute, called a been, the charmer would coax the snake, usually a deadly cobra, from the basket by swaying their instrument from side-to-side. </p>\n<p>\nThe snake, appearing hypnotised, follows the movement of the instrument with its head, appearing to dance. </p>\n<p>\nBudh said: \"We still do private performances at hotels but only for people we know. Otherwise, you never know when the police will try to arrest us and take our snakes away.\" </p>\n<p>\nHis shy six-year old grandson, Karan, regularly ignores his homework to practice playing the flute. \"I love playing with snakes,\" he said. </p>\n<p>\n\"When I grow I want to be a snake charmer like my grandfather.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/snake-532_1481054a.jpg","caption":"Tot a risk! ... little Sumit holds a snake as he learns the ancient art of charming"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/charmer3-532_1481061a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/charmer2-532_1481060a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/charmer-532_1481059a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01481/charmer4-532_1481062a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Doomed ...

Imagine that they died because someone crept up on them and shot them numerous times for no good reason.

Wearing a mask and shooting two guys in cold blood is being a coward. </p>\n<p>\n\"Being a man is about recognising that you are only on this planet once and that you are judged on your actions while you are alive.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTyson had earlier looked bored as DVD presentations prepared by their parents about the dead men's lives, from childhood to manhood, were shown in court. </p>\n<p>\nNone of the parents attended the trial but they had access to the proceedings from a live video feed.

Even Sun columnist Ally Ross had a go at tackling the tricky course last year. </p>\n<p>\nBut the Beeb said the show, together with its spin-off series Winter Wipeout and the celebrity versions, will end after the next series later this year. Last night angry viewers took to Twitter to slam the BBC. Fans also called on rival channels such as Sky1 to snap up the series. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nSun man Ally, a big Total Wipeout fan, said: \"Even by the standards of the BBC this is a dumb decision. It is the only funny show the Beeb broadcast, apart from The Apprentice. Television just got a lot duller. I am spitting feathers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nA BBC spokesman told TV Biz: \"After four successful series of Total Wipeout, and one series of Winter Wipeout, the BBC has taken the decision that the next series will be the last.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Saturday night show  which is filmed in Argentina  often attracts more than 4.5million viewers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4002118/Ally-Ross-takes-on-Total-Wipeout-course.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Up: I let out a bat-squeak of pure terror Down: I turn into a whirlygig of limbs 'like the Isle of Man flag'","br":[null,null]}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3899011/Terry-Christian-breaks-a-rib-in-celebrity-Wipeout.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Terry Christian breaks a rib in celebrity Wipeout"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3718651/Sick-cop-Lesley-Hart-is-caught-out-on-TV-Wipeout.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Sick cop is caught out on TV Wipeout"}],"video":[{"uri":"Q2bXY0MzqKYsqDsdFRyh2IuTZumTekbb","js":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=Q2bXY0MzqKYsqDsdFRyh2IuTZumTekbb&deepLinkEmbedCode=Q2bXY0MzqKYsqDsdFRyh2IuTZumTekbb\"></script>","caption":"THE Sun's TV critic makes a big splash trying out epic obstacle course"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/SNF30TVWIPE1-_1480688a.jpg","caption":"Big fan ...

But today, a teetotal Weller doesn't touch anything stronger than a cup of Tetley's. </p>\n<p>\n\"I haven't had a hangover in 18 months and I feel great,\" says Weller, who admits that he was an alcoholic. </p>\n<p>\n\"Life is good and I've even been driving home after these shows. That would never have happened before.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nSonik Kicks, Weller's 11th solo album, is not only a winner in sales, topping the album charts on the first week of release, it's also one of the most critically acclaimed of his 35-year career. </p>\n<p>\nAnd it is remarkable that in the past few years the ex-Jam and Style Council singer, now 53, has given us his three most experimental albums with Sonik Kicks, 2010's Wake Up The Nation and 2008 double 22 Dreams. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe says: \"It's been a great creative time for me and I've lived and worked long enough to know you have times in life where you're very, very on it and others when you're not. This is something I want to keep going with.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>And it's not only his music that is experiencing change but his personal life too.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHis new wife Hannah, 25, gave birth to twin boys, Bowie and John Paul, in January. </p>\n<p>\nDressed in a stripy shirt, Paul looks as dapper as always but since quitting booze, he looks fresher-faced than in the past and his new lifestyle clearly suits him. </p>\n<p>\nSipping his tea, he says: \"My lovely mother-in-law has been up to help us out so we've slept more this week than we normally do.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nProudly showing me pictures of his sons on his phone, he says: \"Look at them. They sleep facing each other but they don't acknowledge each other yet. </p>\n<p>\n\"They're doing well. Both of them have doubled their bodyweight already, which is not normal apparently. Twins only do that at six months. Here's another photo. One of my other sons has been taking millions of pictures of his skateboard, I see,\" he laughs. </p>\n<p>\nThe birth of Bowie and John Paul takes the Weller brood up to seven, ranging from 23 to two months and Dad is intensely proud of all of them. </p>\n<p>\nHis eldest, Nat, 23, and Leah, 21, are from his marriage to Style Council singer Dee C Lee. </p>\n<p>\nThen there's Dylan, 16, who was born out of a short relationship with her make-up artist mother Lucy, then Jesamine, 12, and Stevie Mac, six, from his long relationship with ex-partner Samantha Stock, who Paul left when he met Hannah Andrews who sang on his album 22 Dreams. </p>\n<p>\nThey married in September 2010 on the Italian island of Capri. </p>\n<p>\n\"Life throws things at you and you never know what's going to happen next,\" he says. </p>\n<p>\n\"You might have all the plans in the world but that doesn't mean anything. Life holds its own secrets and you have to go with them. Sometimes change is painful but ultimately it's good.\" </p>\n<p>\nSonik Kicks is also a family affair. The psychedelic Dragonfly is adapted from a poem by Jesamine. </p>\n<p>\nHannah duets with Weller on the jazzy Study In Blue and Leah and Mac sing on the album's closer piano ballad Be Happy Children, a tribute to Weller's beloved dad and manager John who died in 2009 after a long illness. </p>\n<p>\nWeller says: \"Not all my kids are musical. My two eldest ones are and Mac's going to follow in my footsteps, I think. He's just started to play guitar. He just asked me to show him one day and he's only six. </p>\n<p>\n\"And I hope I have the same relationship with my kids as I did with my dad. He was a brilliant dad and we were great mates. And we got to spend so much time together which is pretty unheard of in life. </p>\n<p>\nI still miss him at times but I've got more of a philosophical view as I think he's with me in whatever form you want to think of it. I can see that carried through to me and to my kids and hopefully to their kids too. </p>\n<p>\nWe don't entirely die as part of us is carried on and continued in the next generation. </p>\n<p>\n\"As for singing with Hannah, Study In Blue is a great song. I really love it. We wanted the right song to do a duet, without it being too slushy. </p>\n<p>\n\"Hannah sings with me but she's not a professional singer and she hasn't got any aspirations to be that. </p>\n<p>\n\"She was brilliant when the twins were born. A proper little trooper. And they were big for twins. One was 5lb 10oz and the other one was 6lb 3oz.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLatest single That Dangerous Age is based around a riff similar to The Kinks' All Day And All Of The Night and David Bowie-style vocals. He says: \"Yes, there is some Bowie in there. I like a lot of his stuff and Hannah is a massive fan. </p>\n<p>\n\"I suppose the song's theme is born out of when me and Hannah first got together. Because of our age difference, people really took an interest in it, saying I must be having a mid-life crisis. But we just fell in love and that's it. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm of the opinion, once you've been touched by music then age doesn't matter. What are you supposed to do, put away your records and clothes when you get to a certain age? </p>\n<p>\n\"My mum is 71 and she still listens to the records she's always listened to. </p>\n<p>\n\"That Dangerous Age is a character study about a guy who's in mid-life, who's got a good job and is dissatisfied and regrets all the things he's never done. </p>\n<p>\n\"But it's certainly not about me. I had my mid-life crisis when I was in my thirties.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDragonfly and The Attic feature Blur's Graham Coxon. He's not the only mate Weller's got in on the album either. </p>\n<p>\nNoel Gallagher plays on three tracks  The Attic, Around The Lake and When Your Garden Is Overgrown  and long-term friend and Ocean Colour Scene guitarist Steve Cradock appears on a number of songs. </p>\n<p>\n\"Yep the extended family features on the record as well as the family,\" he smiles. \"It was a fun album to make.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOne relationship that has suffered, though, in recent times is that of co-songwriter and producer Simon Dine, who has been credited as helping with Weller's rebirth. The pair fell out over money, and went their separate ways. </p>\n<p>\nPaul says: \"Yes, we both worked on this record together but we fell out towards the end. I don't really want to go into it but it was over money. </p>\n<p>\n\"I know there's been mention of him being the reason behind my rebirth,\" he smirks. \"But for the past 35 years I've put out pretty good records without him too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nListening to electronic music, Weller thinks, has really shaped his new sound on Kling I Klang and album opener Green, a psychedelic mindbender that might even surprise some of his die-hard fans. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's certainly one to make people sit up straight away and realise we're in for a different ride,\" he says. \"It's bold, with a Kraftwerk thing going on. There are about two or three tracks on the album that they have influenced. </p>\n<p>\n\"Electronic music is something I'd never heard before but I checked some out a couple of years ago.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOn Paul's five nights at London's Roundhouse last week, he played Sonik Kicks in its entirety. And he says this year will all be about selective shows so he can spend time with his family. </p>\n<p>\nHe explains: \"We're just going to do some one-off shows and make them as special as we can. </p>\n<p>\n\"A few dates in Europe and we've got a couple of gigs in New York then other stuff later in the year, like the Latitude festival. It's all about picking and choosing really. </p>\n<p>\n\"You just get to a certain age and you can't really do it anymore. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's the same with smoking.

We are here to turn each and every one of you into clued-up cupids. </p>\n<p>\nEvery fortnight, sex and relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr throws open the doors to her online Academy. Learning to be a good lover has never been so easy! </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight's lecture: It's time to talk...with a difference </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBBC hit programme The Voice shows how you can take away looks but the human voice is still so powerful. That power extends to phone sex with a whopping 59 per cent of the under 35s experimenting with it to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately it's easy to get wrong and embarrass yourself. Thankfully some boffins in their science labs have done lots of new research on the human voice. </p>\n<p>\nLittle did they know I can help you apply their findings to spare your blushes when you get on the blower. </p>\n<p>\nHere are my top tips for teasing talk on the telephone - </p>\n<p>\n* Sex talk is equally about what you say and how you say it so soften and lower your voice - research shows you immediately sound more attractive. </p>\n<p>\n* Slow your pace too - gabbling on is a turnoff. </p>\n<p>\n* Use a confident tone - research shows you boost each other's sexual confidence this way. </p>\n<p>\n* Avoid 'telephonus-interruptus' - ensure you won't be disturbed. </p>\n<p>\n* Set the scene - you'll feel sexier chatting relaxing on the bed with the lights dimmed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Practice makes perfect - before chatting imagine what you might say to them. Say it aloud to your self - seems daft but it works! </p>\n<p>\n* Go easy now - start gently saying something like how much you loved the last time you were in bed together...but no more detail. </p>\n<p>\n* Gauge their response - see if they start chatting 'details'. </p>\n<p>\n* Next flirt enthusiastically - compliment them, tease them, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* See how hot the banter gets especially with a new partner. Be playful hinting, e.g., \"I'd like to try something involving my dressing gown sash and being tied up.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.19: Successful phone sex is as much about listening as it is about talking.</b> </p>\n<p>\nStudy checklist for turning up the heat - </p>\n<p>\n* You're now equipped to step up the dirty talk. Tread carefully with a new partner so you don't offend them. </p>\n<p>\n* Remember you might want to whisper into the phone, \"I wish you could lick me all over,\" but don't begin with something triple X-rated. </p>\n<p>\n* Give each other sexy nicknames - sharing secret nicknames strengthens your bond. </p>\n<p>\n* Throw in an occasional raunchy comment when they're phone-flirting. </p>\n<p>\n* Now begin giving lots more detail about what you're doing to yourself plus what you want to do to each other! </p>\n<p>\n* Keep in mind how far you can go - they might be happy to talk about being tied up or spanked but be turned off if you use rude words. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMake the best use of what your partner has revealed to you about their secret fantasies, e.g., maybe they've mentioned being rescued by a hunky fireman or looked after by a sexy nurse. Use this info to heighten your phone sex session. </p>\n<p>\nIf you've got lots of trust you can try sexting - sending hot pictures and messages to each other. Big Academy warning: if you don't have trust, don't do it! They could end up being forwarded to others. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many sex toys are sold in the UK each year - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 40,000 </p>\n<p>\nB) 400,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) 4 million </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer:</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is C) a staggering 4 million - get a stockbroker it's time to buy shares in batteries! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: Simon Cowell and his 'type'\n</h1>\n<p>\nIt's rumoured Simon Cowell's been hanging out with stunning makeup girl Francesca Neill. Mind you this is all completely innocent. And undoubtedly Simon Cowell is faithful to fianc&#233; Mezhgan Hussainy. </p>\n<p>\nBut he certainly likes to surround himself with his \"type\" - without fail gorgeous, immaculately groomed and glamorous brunettes. </p>\n<p>\nBeware though there can be big problems with having a romantic type. They can scupper your relationships and that's true for both men and women. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you keep trying to re-create a past relationship by seeking out a particular type, you never give the new person a chance. You try and force them into a mould. And this isn't fair on them or you in the long term. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight: The Starfish </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe needs to be flexible and he needs some strength to control this hot position as she doesn't move much. A good position for the couple where they like him to take control. </p>\n<p>\nShe lies on her back with him between her legs raised up on his hands. She brings both knees towards her chest. Depending on her flexibility she rest her feet either side his chest or on top of his shoulders. </p>\n<p>\nHe controls the action carefully and varies sensations by doing sensual circular moves with his hips, speeding up or slowing down. </p>\n<p>\nBy varying the style of his moves he can give her amazing sensations. If he moves slowly the Starfish builds their intimacy with good eye-contact. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Follow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's NEW sex-and-love guide is available to pre-order at Amazon</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>For more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>This fortnight's lecture</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>Put the science of sexual attraction to work for you</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBBC news presenter Susannah Reid's cleavage has taken on a life of its own - as reported in your Sun people are obsessed with it. That interest boils down to the science of attraction - those signals [in this case a shapely cleavage] that draw our attention. </p>\n<p>\nSometimes you haven't a clue why your eyes spring out of your head cartoon-style when you clock someone. But most of that first attraction is down to body language and other key signals we give. </p>\n<p>\nThose love-boffins found four specific brain regions light up when attracted to someone. This brain activation gives us butterflies in the stomach, feelings of euphoria, etc. -what we label Love Sickness. </p>\n<p>\nYou don't want to have to ring a doc but to stimulate a little Love Sickness in that special person here are 'his and hers' guides. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For her: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*New research shows a lower + slower tone of voice attracts his interest. You might have a complete laugh with your girlfriends but when you meet Mr. Potential slow it down, chill it out. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Give yourself as slim a waistline as possible with fashion tricks - belts, 'body cons', darker colours at the mid-line, etc. Subconsciously men are attracted to a slim waistline that signals youth and fertility. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Science shows large 'doe' eyes set high in the cheeks will attract him at a subconscious level [he can't quite put a finger on what makes you so alluring]. It's worth investing in fabulous false eyelashes. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Stand so your body forms a natural 'S' shape known to naturally attract his attention. Have one leg slightly further out making that hip dip slightly. The other hip naturally rises slightly higher = very feminine curve. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Most men get annoyed when you repeatedly flick your hair but it's the opposite with an occasional slow stroke down the side of your head - seen as sensual. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Use the age-old trick of attracting his eye-line to your cleavage with a pendant or with your fingertips as you chat. This gives him a subconscious signal a your attraction - you want him to notice your femininity. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*If things are heating up and you really fancy him slide your fingers up and down your drink glass slowly. This signals definite attraction. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*If he's unsure whether you're interested give a simple touch to his forearm when chatting to him - subtly signals your interest. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>For him: </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>*Be a 'doer' - women are attracted to action so don't sit back being shy and quiet. When you make a move, go over, say hello, etc., you immediately score lots of points even if at first you're not her physical type. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*Chat her up at the gym as research shows fresh sweat attracts women - note the key word is fresh. So straight after a class say hello don't hang around while your sweat gets stale. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*The female eye notices the classic V-shape of a man's shoulders - usually broader than the hips. So if you're not muscled up top, use the right clothing to bulk out your shoulders. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*As with vocal tone for women [above] you signal confidence with a slower deeper tone. Even if your stomach is somersaulting with nerves keep that voice calm and controlled. </p>\n<p>\n<b>* If you haven't met yet and you're standing, e.g., at a bar where she can notice you, either casually rest your hand on your hip or loop a finger through your belt loop. At a subconscious level this is a display to her of your masculinity - or your man-package. It's very primal! </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n*If you're crossing a room to make contact slow your pace and try and add a little bit of swagger - don't go over the top with a big alpha male display. Subconsciously women notice the masculinity of a man's walk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>*Women often worry [sometimes rightly] a man's only after one thing. At a subtle level she'll notice if you start 'mirroring' her body language as you chat. This signals genuine interest rather than a shallow one - heaven forbid you'd have to shallow intentions! (Smile) </b>\n</p>\n<h1>\n<b>Academy Rule No.18</b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nStudents should always maximise their potential - if you're looking for love you want to look your best. And if you have love you want to keep their interest. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Q: What's the average length of call to a phone-sex chat-line - is it: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>A</b>/ 10 minutes </p>\n<p>\n<b>B</b>/ 1 minute </p>\n<p>\n<b>C</b>/ 100 minutes </p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A/ 10 minutes. And judging by Channel 4's My Phone Sex Secrets all types ring them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Jessica Simpson and fianc&#233; Eric Johnson </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nPregnant women look away now as Jessica's hot bedroom antics might just annoy you. Where most women as far gone as she is are content with a cuddle and a foot massage, she claims things have never been more exciting. </p>\n<p>\nJessica says she's unstoppable when it comes to sex with fianc&#233; Eric. And she's having the biggest 'big Os' ever. </p>\n<p>\nI think most pregnant women will agree it's simply TMI (too much information) and please don't give their partners any ideas! </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<b>Dr Pam's Position </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Ploughman </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe're not talking about cheese-based lunches here! This position requires some flexibility but is worth having a go at. She's lying comfortably on her back and he's kneeling between her legs. She draws both her legs up so her knees are bent and her heels rest towards her bottom at the sides of his hips. </p>\n<p>\nBecause he's kneeling he can pull her hips slightly higher up his thighs for good access. He controls the gentle movements to keep things steady. Couples love the sensations from this position but if he gets tired they can easily slip into classic missionary. </p>\n<p>\nFollow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's NEW sex-and-love guide is available to PRE-ORDER BY CLICKING HERE</a> </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit drpam.co.uk</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lesson: When men lose their sex drive </h1>\n<p>\nThere's this big fat sex-myth that men are always in the mood for sex. Footie team wins? Celebratory sex is on the menu. Footie team loses? It's consolatory sex to cheer him up. Best mate's birthday? Wey-hey, carry on the party at home and so on. </p>\n<p>\nBecause of this pressure men can feel completely useless when they lose sexual interest. Hey, where did it go? they wonder as they search high and low...um, nothing's happening in my boxers, nothing's happening when I wake up, or when she wears her special knickers, etc. </p>\n<p>\nOf course we women decide it must be us - we're not attractive enough anymore. He feels useless, she feels unattractive = not very good for the sex life. </p>\n<p>\nMen lose their va-va-va-voom for as many different reasons as women do - stress at work, not looking after themselves, rows between you two. But it can also be down to TDS - testosterone deficiency syndrome. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.17:</b> Students must let each other know when they're worried about not having sex. Stewing in silence is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough TDS usually strikes the over-50s it also hits many younger men especially from age 35 onwards. Not only do they lose interest in sex and find their erections aren't as powerful but they might feel they're less energetic generally and be more forgetful. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Begin by getting up the courage to speak to each other. You'll both feel so much better and mightily relieved you care enough to discuss things. </p>\n<p>\n* Check with your GP whether TDS or some other medical issue might be responsible for lack of sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep the affection and cuddles going between you. </p>\n<p>\n* Definitely have loads of fun sex-play - it doesn't have to go all the way. </p>\n<p>\n* For more TDS info visit www.sortEDin10.co.uk</a> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nWhether he's in the mood - or experiencing low sex drive  nothing's stopping you two from fun foreplay. Create a seductive \"love zone\" in your sitting room - keep one corner stuffed with cushions, candles at the ready, and your fave music in the player. </p>\n<p>\nKeep a crafty bottle of massage oil handy and give each other the Erotic 8 technique. </p>\n<p>\nTake turns lying on your backs and doing this - it gives sensual stimulation of many erogenous zones. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStart with your hands together at the breastbone and swirl outwards and under their breasts or side of his ribcage. Then bring your hands together at the point just above their navel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThen swirl back outwards along their hips bringing your hands back together at their pubic bone. You can see how this makes a figure 8 shape. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRepeat swirling your hands back up their body coming in just above their navel, then outwards and back up to the top of their breastbone. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRepeat varying the pressure and speed of swirling in-and-out over their body. For extra pleasure: feels heavenly done on the back and bum if you lie on your stomach. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many women said they'd propose any time and not only leap year day - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 64% </p>\n<p>\nB) 24% </p>\n<p>\nC) 14% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 24% of women say they'd happily propose any time. Guys, there you thought you could breathe a sigh of relief with leap year now past! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Tulisa and 'The Dream' </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTulisa's doing just what every girl should do after a serious break-up - find an alpha male to take you around and show you a good time. She's been doing this with big-time producer The Dream in Miami. </p>\n<p>\nMind you, you shouldn't hang out with someone who can wine-and-dine you straight after a break-up - too easy for them to sweep you off your feet, into bed, and maybe break your heart for a second time. </p>\n<p>\nBut Tulisa's timing is right and a couple of months down the line is the perfect time to go out and have fun. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Split the Whisker </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a super hot position that'll give couples more sexual confidence. </p>\n<p>\nThe man crouches on his knees as the woman lies on her back, one of her legs resting on his shoulder. Split the Whisker gives him good control because he holds her thighs, hips, or knees, in order to keep control and not slip out. </p>\n<p>\nYou can be in bed or on the floor as long as his knees are comfortable while he's crouching. </p>\n<p>\nMen love this position as it gives them a great view of her that can be a big turn on. It's also exciting for the sexually confident woman who wants to show off her body. For women to have G-spot sensitivity this zone can be pleasured if he pulls her hips slightly up his thighs. </p>\n<p>\nFollow Dr Pam on twitter @drpamspurr</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lesson: <br></br>Taking sex outside the bedroom </h1>\n<p>\nForget estate agents when you think of location, location, location... unless you're chatting about an estate agent fantasy. And, yes, some people might have fantasies about estate agents! </p>\n<p>\nInstead think of location as easy way to keep sex exciting. We're SO influenced by surroundings - no surprise the bedroom gets a bit ho-hum and boring. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Getting creative with locations -</b> </p>\n<p>\nAs long as you're not breaking any laws - or are very careful not to get caught - here are location suggestions. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 1:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* In the bath/shower with warm cascades of water rushing over you. </p>\n<p>\n* On the floor - any floor - but either one that's carpeted or put down a soft blanket. </p>\n<p>\n* Get carried away in the kitchen but you'll definitely need something to cushion kitchen floor tiles/countertops. </p>\n<p>\n* Working hard at your desk and want a break? Maybe you're in a hot new relationship - lean against your desk or workstation for a quickie. </p>\n<p>\n* Just in from an evening out? Why not have a quickie against the doorframe in your front hall. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 2:</b> </p>\n<p>\n* Everyone's gone home so you have the offices to yourselves. Make sure you don't get caught out by the late-night cleaner. </p>\n<p>\n* Get sex-perimental in a swimming pool - the buoyancy of the water makes things fun. Why not let the water lap around you as you go for it on a swimming pool lilo. </p>\n<p>\n* You're at a boring party - nip into the bathroom for a quickie without others knowing. </p>\n<p>\n* Gazing at the stars from a deck chair at your holiday hotel? Then try alfresco sex under the stars. Mind no one can see what you're doing - unless of course you're dogging - in which case that's a different story. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Locations - Level 3: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n* Time for some nail-biting adventure and get sneaky in your office during office hours. A good place is in the stationery cupboard, staff bathroom or behind your locked office door if you have the nerves for it. </p>\n<p>\n* Let's see if you can be so quiet while having sex in your garden shed while your neighbour's sitting next door in their garden haven't a clue. </p>\n<p>\n* Go for some sporting moments and do a 'Boris Becker' in the broom cupboard of a restaurant. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy warning: </b>Dubai is a popular holiday destination but never ever break indecency laws in a country like that. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.16:</b> Students should remember variety is the spice of life - that includes location. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Always have something to hand you can throw over yourselves to cover-up if someone comes by. </p>\n<p>\n* Always have a picnic blanket or at least a thick jacket to put under them for their comfort. Or to pad out any tender body part pressing against, e.g., a stone wall/tree-trunk. Naughty you if you haven't thought of your partner's comfort! </p>\n<p>\n* Pleasure each other with your hands or through oral sex when outdoors. It heightens your sense of risk. </p>\n<p>\n* Simply start your foreplay when out and about - save finishing each other off at home can lead to exhilarating sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Once spring is here use sun cream for any under-exposed body area that may see the light of day  like your bum! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\n'Take 10' to think about your local area and dream up a new location to suggest. When cuddling up tell describe how that beauty spot you go for walks in would be the perfect place to grab some sneaky sex - or at least some fun foreplay. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The equation:</b> Always having sex in bed = using the same position time-after-time. Take things out of the bedroom and you're likely to try new positions too. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How much will the rich and famous spend on a platinum covered, diamond encrusted vibrator? </p>\n<p>\nA) &#163;2,000 </p>\n<p>\nB) &#163;200 </p>\n<p>\nC) &#163;20,000 </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - talk about more money than sense - you can get this dazzling number courtesy of Jimmyjane.com.

But if either goes queasy at the thought, there's plenty to discuss before slipping into a sex club armed with little more than a nervous grin and condoms. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule:</b> Must I tell you no one should be pressured into a three- or moresome if they're not into it? Exactly! Discussion is one thing, pressure is a no-no. </p>\n<p>\nCouples who discuss fantasies to spice-up sex usually delve into the arena of three-ways. </p>\n<p>\nBut fantasies are SO different to reality. It's hard enough grappling with two sets of sexual needs plus the more embarrassing side of sex like sweaty bodies and surprising sounds. </p>\n<p>\nFactor in a third set of these things and suddenly keeping it only to fantasy-chat is appealing. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise if determined to go for it: </p>\n<p>\n* You both must really, really want to try it. </p>\n<p>\n* Agree how to go about it, e.g., do you want to look through contact mags or go to a local swinging party or fetish club to find a third-party. </p>\n<p>\n* Sex clubs all have their own rules so check these out. </p>\n<p>\n* Agreeing ground rules is a must. Some couples put certain sexual behaviour off limits like giving or receiving oral sex. </p>\n<p>\n* Accept either - or both - might experience jealousy if feeling threatened in any way by the third party. That includes thinking the third party is more attractive, better in bed, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* Excellent communication between you is crucial to avoid jealousy/insecurity. </p>\n<p>\n* Discuss whether you'll have the same third party involved in regular sex sessions or always look for new partners. Some couples prefer seeing the same third party. Others worry some sort of love triangle might form threatening their relationship. </p>\n<p>\n* Be prepared that after trying this one of you might go off the idea. </p>\n<p>\n* Get all MI6 about it and \"debrief\" after each experience to see how you're both feeling. </p>\n<p>\n* Crucial to abide by ground rules like NO outside contact - like phone calls - with any new sex partners. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nSpend time discussing each other's motives for wanting a threesome. Some are positive - you're both sexually confident and experimental. Others negative - you need a confidence boost or to combat bedroom boredom. </p>\n<p>\nNegative things need serious consideration because adding a third person is likely to complicate these. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nBefore going for it, get in bed and try to fully imagine having a third person in there with you. Spelling out the details to each other might make you more cautious. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Desire to try it + complete confidence between you = worth a shot! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How much cool cash did Michelle Obama reportedly spend this week in Agent Provocateur's New York emporium? </p>\n<p>\nA) &#163;320 </p>\n<p>\nB) &#163;32,000 </p>\n<p>\nC) &#163;3,200 </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge Answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - that's a heckuva lot of oh-oh-heaven for President Obama. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Heidi Klum and Seal</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nYep, this super-gorgeous couple are separated but Seal said in an interview this week he still loves Heidi. </p>\n<p>\nWhere there's love, there's a way to sort things out. With three children between them plus a fourth from another relationship of Heidi's they shouldn't give up on love too soon. </p>\n<p>\nRumours have been rife about why a couple that always looked love-struck on the red carpet would split. </p>\n<p>\nNone of these alleged reasons are insurmountable, even the ones about Seal having a bad temper. </p>\n<p>\nAnger management, couples counselling, both sticking in there, whatever it takes is worth it before these kids' lives are torn apart for good. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Spinner</b> </p>\n<p>\nHe lies flat on the bed/floor and she sits astride him facing him. She then spins carefully around so she ends up facing his feet. </p>\n<p>\nThis position allows her to vary the pressure of penetration by varying the way she sits. </p>\n<p>\nLeaning forward, her hands on his ankles, decreases pressure. Leaning back, resting her hands at the side of his stomach, increases pressure. </p>\n<p>\nHe can hold her hips to maintain penetration so she doesn't slip off. Slipping her feet underneath her (with knees bent), while supporting herself with her hands, she can then raise and lower herself. </p>\n<p>\nThis variation is known as 'offering the moon' because of the way her bottom moves up and down (mooning) in full view of him.

So if he or she is always pestering you for sex - and you just don't have the interest - you've got a lot of company. </p>\n<p>\nIt's not really surprising - after all when you got together he preferred pizza and she preferred Chinese. He loved an action holiday and she loved lying on the beach. So why wouldn't your sex drives be different too? </p>\n<p>\nBut there's double-trouble when this happens. The partner who has a higher drive feels neglected. And the partner who has a lower drive feels pestered or inadequate. </p>\n<p>\nThese issues have a way of creeping into the rest of your relationship even when you know you love your partner. Time to tackle the differences between your drives. </p>\n<p>\nThe first step is to stop any finger-pointing. Playing the blame game will get you nowhere. Being honest, loving and tactful is the only way to go. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.14: Students should remember there is no right or wrong to how high or low your sex drive is as long as you're both working towards a compromise.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\nHere are some [not all, mind you] of the main culprits affecting sex drive - see how many might apply to you or your partner. </p>\n<p>\n* lifestyle issues like out-of-control stress and long working hours </p>\n<p>\n* personal choices like excessive drinking, and 'recreational' drug use </p>\n<p>\n* being overweight leading to less sexual energy </p>\n<p>\n* experiencing depression and anxiety </p>\n<p>\n* relationship difficulties or breakdown, rows, etc. </p>\n<p>\n* certain physical problems like having a bad back are draining </p>\n<p>\n* fatigue after childbirth can kill sexual desire </p>\n<p>\n* surprising things affect sex drive including medications like the birth control pill, anti-depressants and blood pressure medications </p>\n<p>\n* hormonal changes later in life for both men and women </p>\n<p>\n* other passion killers include worries over financial problems </p>\n<p>\n* and to be brutally honest... plain old boredom in the bedroom can lead to lack of sex drive </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> </p>\n<p>\nPut aside 10 minutes this weekend to study this list and work out if these - or any other things - are affecting your sex drive or your partner's. </p>\n<p>\nIf you identify a culprit or two what can you do about these? The first step is to share this info with your partner - a positive \"we can fix this together\" attitude has been proven to help. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're overly stressed at work  it's killed your sex drive leaving your partner high and dry. Obviously deal with the stresses - take on fewer responsibilities, talk to your manager about streamlining your work load, etc. </p>\n<p>\nBut when you feel up to a fun solution play a sex-game where you pretend to be someone completely different - someone without a care in the world. </p>\n<p>\nGive yourself 'permission' to let go and have fun. Tell your partner you're shutting out worries and focusing on some sexy pleasure. Spin this into a hot fantasy where you're the boss in your dream job - and you're interviewing them to work for you. The main interview 'test'? You have your way with them! </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: being honest about issues + actually sorting them = increased sex drive! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people admit to dumping a lover by text - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 30 per cent </p>\n<p>\nB) 10 per cent </p>\n<p>\nC) 70 per cent </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nA survey out this week reveals the correct answer is B) - 10 per cent say they've dumped a lover by text - how cowardly! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Peaches Geldof and Thomas Cohen</b> </p>\n<p>\nPeaches has always lived life in the fast lane and it's revving up to full throttle now she's expecting her first baby and planning her second marriage at 22 to musician Thomas. </p>\n<p>\nI can only hope this marriage gives her the stability she needs because she'll need to provide her baby with stability. It doesn't happen in reverse - babies aren't there to make you feel better about yourself or to give your life meaning. </p>\n<p>\nThankfully there's the optimism-of-youth on her side that she can conquer all the hurdles coming her way.

Try my tips, tricks and techniques to sexy satisfaction: </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 1: How To Find Out What They Desire</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMany are too shy to say what they like. If your partner's shy take their finger and gently suck and kiss it - then ask if those sensations feel good. Put that info to good use for kissing and sucking their different erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nAlso say something like, \"Do you prefer it when I stroke or squeeze you here?\" It gives them the confidence to be honest. </p>\n<p>\nDefo tell them it's exciting when they tell you what to do to them. Make it playful where they must \"command\" you by saying Yes or No if you're touching the right spot - and in the right way. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 2: Any Activity Can Be Sexy</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTurn practically any activity together into sexy fun and give each other little sensual pleasures. Offer to wash their hair - gently and sensually caress their scalp as the warm water rushes over it...heaven! </p>\n<p>\nOr do something surprising like paint her fingernails. Take each of her fingers gently and show just how sensual your touch can be as you paint each nail. </p>\n<p>\nNever miss a trick when sharing supper to get a little bit rude with food. It's incredibly hot to hand feed each other. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 3: Quickie Tricks</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDevise your favourite 'quickie tricks' that press both of your buttons. For instance he might have one perfect way of touching her that turns her right on. She should let him know what it is because that's the technique to use when you've only got a little time. </p>\n<p>\nWhy doesn't he try 'twirling the pearl' for a quick turn-on? Using his thumb and index finger he gently twirls back and forth around her clitoral region. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 4: Have a laugh</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nToo many couples take sex too seriously - they forget to laugh with (not at!) each other even when things go wrong. </p>\n<p>\nTry fun things like spontaneously deciding to jump into a shower together. Enjoy the water rushing over you, lather each other up, and even invest in a waterproof sex toy. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you've got ice cubes in a drink have a giggle and slip one down each other's tops - then roll around in bed trying to get it off your skin - and back onto theirs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexy Step No. 5: Kinky-lite</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTry 'Kinky-lite' techniques like playing a little game of At Your Mercy - one of you is blindfolded while the other is allowed to touch, kiss, and lick all over. You don't know which area's going to be touched next! </p>\n<p>\nOr agree to have your wrists tied together with something soft and silky like a dressing gown sash - have some fantasy chat about being at your partner's mercy.

Or they get stuck just moving a vibrator back and forth - a bit snooze-inducing. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Sex Toy Etiquette:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nNever introduce a sex toy by whipping a big, shiny, pulsating one out, waving it around and expecting your partner to be instantly aroused. Instead try these ploys \n</p>\n<p>\n*If unsure of their reaction be subtle - suggest popping into your local adult shop and gently steer them to the vibrators. </p>\n<p>\n*Start toying with said toys and look quizzical - as if you're wondering whether they'd be fun or not. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask if they've ever thought about what playing with a vibrator would be like. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep it light and flirty to give them confidence to take a good look at the toys. </p>\n<p>\n*Never grab the biggest vibrator (and crikey there are some huge ones on the market) particularly if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\n*Keep sex toys as an added extra to your sex-play so your partner doesn't feel redundant. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Good Vibrations:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAlways use lashings of lubricant for a lovely smooth glide across any erogenous zone. </p>\n<p>\nRemember he might be just as keen as she is to feel a vibrator running up and down his chest, abdomen, between the thighs, over the perineum and anal area. </p>\n<p>\nProblem is many men don't want to appear anything but 'straight' - so she should suggest it. </p>\n<p>\nOr after he's used a vibrator on her erogenous zones she can tease him with it. Sometimes it takes her confidence that it's okay for him to enjoy vibrating pleasure for him to relax and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>\nFor added pleasure during penetrative sex slip the vibrator between you two. They come in all sorts of shapes/sizes so invest in a range for different uses - a slimmer one will slip between the two of you easier. </p>\n<p>\nJust in case it's got a powerful vibration, first run it across their abdomen so they can get used to the feel of it. Then you can ask if she's ready for it to be run across her breasts or he's ready to have it run between his thighs. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she's turned on, gently run it back and forth across her pubic mound. Rather than using the end of the vibrator to touch her skin, lay it 'flat' along her pubic bone and move it back and forth covering a bigger area with the vibrations. Guaranteed to drive her crazy! </p>\n<p>\nIt's definitely worth investing in a fingertip vibrator. Slip onto your forefinger and reach all sorts of tiny and exciting places that a normal-sized vibrator can't. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.12:</b> Students shouldn't use a vibrator for more than 20 minutes on one area as you can over-stimulate that area. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Hygiene is crucial so, e.g., if you use an anal vibrator it shouldn't then be used on her vagina. </p>\n<p>\n* Keep separate sex toys for each other. </p>\n<p>\n* Clean your sex toys as per the instructions. </p>\n<p>\n* Before you use a new sex toy get used to the way it works - some are complicated. </p>\n<p>\n* Never ever use everyday items as makeshift sex toys! </p>\n<p>\n* As well as pleasuring each other use for self-pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n* When using lubricants choose water-based ones that won't break down the surface of your plastic-based toys. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you've never tried a 'tongue joy' vibrator get one for oral pleasure! </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nThis neat little vibrator slips onto your tongue so that during oral sex not only does your partner feel the warmth and moistness of your lips and tongue but also the fabulous little vibrations from this sex toy.

Add to this the intense national scrutiny and I can only see it ending in tears. </p>\n<p>\nThere's nothing wrong with an age gap relationship on the whole - but they work far better if both people have at least reached their 20s. Otherwise there's a risk the older partner takes over and controls everything. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Sexy Santa [normally called The Staging Post] </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI specially renamed this red hot position The Sexy Santa for Christmas.

She can hold on to the bed frame for support. </p>\n<p>\nHer back is towards him as he stands on the floor and enters her from behind. </p>\n<p>\nHe can definitely be her sexy Santa - while he moves gently he can wrap his arms around her waist and caress her breasts for extra pleasure. This position also allows him to nuzzle the back of her neck - a sensitive erogenous zone. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available <b>HERE</b></a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit <b>www.drpam.co.uk</b></a>. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons: When your partner has a fetish </h1>\n<p>\nThe minute a new partner [or even a long-term partner] utters the phrase, \"Honey, I've got a bit of a fetish,\" many could be forgiven for heading out the door sharpish. </p>\n<p>\nDon't panic, though, as many fetishes are completely harmless so let's begin with a simple definition: </p>\n<p>\nA fetish is any object, item of clothing, or body area that someone finds sexually arousing. </p>\n<p>\nWith a true fetish the person always needs to have the fetish object present [or at least is able to easily fantasise about it] to enjoy sexual pleasure. </p>\n<p>\nBut for many people it's something they simply prefer but don't have to have to still enjoy sex. So a man might say he has a 'fetish' for large breasts but lo-and-behold his partner has small ones. And a woman might say she has a 'fetish' for men in gym gear but she doesn't turn into a raving nympho the minute a man strolls into her aerobics class. </p>\n<p>\nWhere do fetishes come from? Sometimes the development of a fetish is very complex but other fetishes are easily understood. Take the teenage boy pleasuring himself as he stands at his bedroom window. He catches sight of the neighbour doing some gardening in her Wellington boots and hey, presto, Wellington boots forever hold a special meaning. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a fetish checklist every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Always ask your partner to describe exactly what they mean by 'fetish'. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Check out if they can only be turned on with their fetish or if it's simply a preference. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Have fun considering compromises. For instance, if he has a fetish for women in PVC it might work for her to slip into a PVC basque OR miniskirt. She doesn't have to dress head-to-toe in it yet he'll love the fact she's wearing one PVC piece. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>See if fantasy chat about the fetish will satisfy that partner's desire. You could potentially chat up a storm about him worshiping your feet - instead of him actually licking and sucking your toes if that turns you right off [think Fergie all those years ago]. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Some fetishes might seem downright comical - like a fetish for pink, fluffy slippers or footie strips. But resist having a laugh at your partner if they're willing to trust you and open up. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>If either of you are troubled by their fetish consider sex therapy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule: Be honest if a fetish turns you off.</b> If a fetish like splodging [having a 'good' time hurling cream cakes, etc., or rolling around in puds] makes you laugh it can spoil the moment for the partner that takes their splodging seriously. </p>\n<p>\nDitto if your partner has what you think is a disgusting fetish involving something like 'scat play' [let's not even go there!] put your foot down fast. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework:</b> Think through how you can enjoy your partner's fetish. Let's say they've a fetish for gloves. Buy a pair and surprise them during foreplay by whisking them on. </p>\n<p>\nFor their added pleasure select the texture your partner prefers - soft and velvety, smooth and silky, firm and leathery. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy sex trick:</b> as you'll be left- or right-handed - and probably use that hand in foreplay - try swapping over. Use the hand you don't normally use to caress them giving a new sensation. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A fun attitude + fun fetishes = fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of people have a foot fetish according to fetish research - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 1.1% </p>\n<p>\nB) 11% </p>\n<p>\nC) 21% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - just over 1% of people reportedly have a foot fetish. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Jennifer Lopez and Casper Smart </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nJ-Lo, 42, has revealed her credentials as a top-class cougar by getting with tattooed toyboy dancer Casper Smart, 24. The chemistry between them sizzles and right now they seem inseparable. </p>\n<p>\nBut I hope Jennifer's as savvy as Madonna when it comes to cougar love. Madonna plays by a simple rule: these are fun, sexy relationships that both parties can enjoy... but they're not permanent! </p>\n<p>\nDemi Moore on the other hand has found out the tough way most younger men don't stick around for a happy-ever-after. There's far too much temptation out there and most aren't in the mental place yet for a committed, lifelong relationship. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Lovers' Embrace</b> </p>\n<p>\nTry moving into this sensual position from classic Missionary (where he's on top). </p>\n<p>\nAll he needs to do is gently slide off of her while gently pulling her towards him - so they end up on their sides facing each other. Once in position she simply lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p>\nTo vary the sexy sensations she can move her leg further up his hip - or close it down more tightly around his knees. By wrapping her leg around his knees and pulling his legs more into hers it adds lots of good friction between them - great if he's on the smaller side. </p>\n<p>\nSextra Academy tip: Allow your hands to wander over each other's backs and bums.

Evidently a whopping 33% of single girls sleep with their male friends. </p>\n<p>\nSuch friendship fringe benefits put a smile on many faces. But handled badly friends can fall-out over their best mate booty-calls. </p>\n<p>\nHere are definite 'dos and don'ts' for your friendship that strays into full-sex territory: </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Friends often flirt with each other - which is why many question whether men and women can really 'just be friends'. So take it cautiously if there's been flirting between you and secretly you'd like things to end up in bed. They may not feel the same! </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> It's likely the first time you two slept together it was under the influence of too many drinks...the classic starting point for so many friends with fringe benefits. So have a chat the morning after to make sure you're both feeling okay about it. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Never humiliate your friend by telling your other pals what you two got up to. Keeping it between your selves avoids loads of gossip or other friends sticking their oar in. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li>Even if you two have occasionally gone all-the-way no friend should feel pressured to always say Yes to a booty call. </p>\n<p>\n<li></li> Don't be surprised when your friendly fringe benefits end because one of you finds a proper boyfriend or girlfriend. No room for jealousy - after all you were only friends that took it further. </p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No.9: Always be honest with a friend you're sleeping with. If you know they're falling in love with you - and you don't feel the same - set them straight. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nSince you've already got trust between you why not get up to some hot sex-perimentation you wouldn't normally try? Go on, they're a friend so don't be slow in coming forward. Ask if there's something they've always wanted to do. </p>\n<p>\nThis is the perfect time to share something like a steamy shower where you sensually lather each other up. Then you can take turns satisfying each other with oral pleasure. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Tip:</b> Take a cushion into the shower to kneel on when you're giving oral sex (mind you, a cushion you don't mind getting soaked). </p>\n<p>\nAs the water cascades down you'll both love the sensations of having oral fun under a shower. Have two big warm towels ready to dry each other off with. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nNow you know loads more about each other's likes and dislikes having got playful in the shower. Take that knowledge into the bedroom for more sex-ploration. Why not ask them to keep still while you gently run a sex toy up and down their body to give them lovely sensations. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: friends + fringe benefits = having fun (if you both know where you stand)! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Test Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people who have flings-with-friends are hoping for a relationship too? </p>\n<p>\nA) 8% </p>\n<p>\nB) 38% </p>\n<p>\nC) 68% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A) - 8% of people who sleep with a friend say they're also hoping for romance. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>Loved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Sarah Harding and Tom Crane </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nStunning Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding looks like she's sorting out her personal problems as well as her broken engagement with DJ Tom Crane.

They care more about a guy's personality - plus his sex-techniques that'll satisfy every time. </p>\n<p>\nBut try telling that to a 'smaller' man - it takes loads of encouragement for them to believe it. </p>\n<p>\n<b>The Size Statistics:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nCrossing the Channel there are 'size stats' from French research out this week. The beret-clad boffins found the average erect penis is between 12.8 - 14.5 cm [5 - 5.7 inches]. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's smaller than this it doesn't mean he can't 'live it large' in the bedroom with many top tips below. </p>\n<p>\nFirst a quick question: Are you a \"grower\" or \"shower\"? Many smaller men when flaccid [non-erect] actually grow 100 per cent when erect. Many larger men when flaccid are likely to grow by only 75 per cent when erect. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No.8:</b> No Academy student should ever ridicule a man's size - such remarks can scar him for life. If a woman ridicules your size she's not worth your time. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student can memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* The Americans have a saying \"a diamond's better than a brick\" - so a 'smaller' man should always be confident about giving pleasure in other ways. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Remember that some [not all] well-endowed men have no sexual finesse in bed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* It's crucial a man sees himself as a complete man - not just a man with a certain-sized penis. He's far more than his penis size! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Confidence is highly attractive. So the smaller man that's confident generally - and about his sex techniques - will satisfy his partner. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* The average length of a woman's vagina when aroused is about 10 cm [4 inches]. So it doesn't take as much length to satisfy her as men think. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* So-called Small Penis Syndrome - or 'locker room syndrome' - is more common in men of average size. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Despite the 'averages' there's huge variation amongst men. The famous Masters and Johnson's research team measured hundreds of penises - the longest non-erect one was 5.5 inches long. The shortest was just over 2 inches long. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* A 'smaller' man should aim to be the \"King of foreplay\" to thrill his partner. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework [and this applies to any couple not just a man on the smaller side!]: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBecome the King of Foreplay by confidently asking her what she'd like you to do. As you kiss ask what kind of touch she'd like on her breasts, etc. </p>\n<p>\nLearn to use your fingertips wisely  vary between gentle strokes, circular movements, swishing back and forth, and gentle pinches. Keep asking what feels best. </p>\n<p>\nDitto your tongue and lips - try licking, flicking, sucking and circular movements with your tongue. </p>\n<p>\nCompletely spoil her by kissing, licking and touching all over her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe can encourage him to become the King of foreplay: if you feel shy asking for what you want when cuddling take his hands and move them to your fave erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nKeeping your hand on top of his, gently move it back and forth over these showing the type of touch you like. </p>\n<p>\nTake his finger between your lips and suck it the way you'd like him to apply pressure to your fave zones like your nipples. </p>\n<p>\nYou'll really turn him on if you get the courage up to whisper detailed instructions of what feels best as you get nearer to climax. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: Foreplay techniques + confidence = a great lover! </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percentage of women report being happy/satisfied with their partner's penis size - </p>\n<p>\nA) 5% </p>\n<p>\nB) 85% </p>\n<p>\nC) 25% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: </p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is B) - 85 per cent of women are perfectly satisfied by their partner's size. </p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>George Clooney and Stacy Keibler </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe big question on Tinseltown's lips is whether gorgeous George Clooney has met his match in stunning wrestler Stacy Keibler. </p>\n<p>\nThe statuesque blonde would be wise to treat it like a wrestling match - going in with a game plan if she wants to beat his reputed phobia of commitment. </p>\n<p>\nIf you're with a man that's shy of committing let your confident independent side shine through.

This sends the \"Yawn Factor\" in the bedroom sky high. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhy do couples do this? Like most things in their relationship their sex position simply becomes a habit. For instance, it's Friday night and he's on his way home - he thinks to himself, \"Ah, it's sex night, that means a couple brews and Spoons position before bedtime.\" Mind you, she's probably thinking the same. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNothing wrong with 'comfortable' sex in a long-term relationship - but without occasional changes it's a passion killer. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Inwardly many partners feel shy about suggesting a new position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Or they don't want to upset their partner by suggesting a new one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*Couples don't realise it's fairly easy to move into another position from their tried-and-tested one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*If they don't like a new position they can go back to the old one. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n*It's okay to take time after being in one position to pause for more foreplay - it might lead into trying a second position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy Rule No. 7: You don't have to stay in one position from the start of a sex-session to the finish. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nYour Hot Homework: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Try one of the following suggestions:</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n1/ Let's begin with a simple sex-periment - begin in classic Missionary position  he lies on top of her. Then he shifts his weight off of her, moving onto his side and facing her. This frees her to move onto her side but with her back to him. As easy as that you're now in Spoons position. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n2/ Try The Cradle position  she's on top, lying chest-against-chest with him. She draws her legs up underneath her so her knees are bent. It's called the Cradle because it's as if she's now cradling him with her body. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis is perfect for slow and sensual moving and allows you two lots of touching and kissing. Some women may need to reach under and cradle his bottom to steady them if his thrusting intensifies. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n3/ Or experiment with the Lovers' Embrace position. You can easily move into this from The Cradle [above] - you both gently ease sideways. Or from Spoons - she simply turns around to face him. Or move into it from Missionary. All you do is lie on your sides facing each other, embracing. She lifts her upper thigh to allow him to slide into her. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAcademy spice-it-up tip: To vary sensations she moves her leg further up or closes it back down more tightly on his leg. This varies the pressure you both feel. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFirst reassure your partner you enjoy what you do together - but that you want to tempt them into </p>\n<p>\none of these new positions. Be confident that it's going to be fun. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe equation: A positive attitude + A new position = Fun sex! </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\n<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge: </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nQ: In one survey how many women said they could find their elusive G-spot - was it: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nA/ 56% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nB/ 16% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nC/ 6% </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge answer: </b>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe correct answer is A/ - 56% said they have a sensitive area on the front wall of the vagina </p>\n<p>\npopularly known as the G-spot.

Most people have a few quirks or kinks they secretly wonder about. Often these aren't mentioned until they build trust with their partner. Obviously they don't want to be laughed at or to shock their partner. </p>\n<p>\nAs far as I'm concerned - as long it is legal - what you as consenting adults discuss trying is your business. </p>\n<p>\nThe most common kinky things partners ask to try include: Being blindfolded, a bit of spanking, tying up, and dressing in role-play outfits. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 6</b>: Students should never feel pressured to go beyond the 'kink-level' they feel happy with! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\nIf your partner raises kinky sex-play (or you want to raise it with them) try these: </p>\n<p>\n*Be clear exactly what's meant. The word \"bondage\" might be mentioned and all they mean is getting fur-lined handcuffs from the high street adult shop. They don't mean sticking you in a dungeon! </p>\n<p>\n*Because some partners will panic at words like \"bondage\" think carefully how you describe the thing you want to try... so take the fright-factor out. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll boost your confidence if you stick to some fantasy-chat first. It's fun and sexy and you can sound out how far you two might want to go. </p>\n<p>\n* It'll make you both feel secure reassuring each other this is \"special occasion sex\". You're not going to have to 'swing from chandeliers' every time you have sex. </p>\n<p>\n*If you do anything like handcuffing each other remember it's no joke to leave someone handcuffed (or tied up). Just don't do it! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nLet's take the handcuffs scenario - invest in some from an adult shop. Or spare your blushes and order them online. Then experiment on each other. </p>\n<p>\nYou can tease the person who's handcuffed by kissing them all over and even \"tormenting\" them with an ice cube held between your lips. Trace a cold line over their erogenous zones only to be warmed up with a trail of lovely warm kisses afterwards. </p>\n<p>\nOr while they're \"captive\" turn it into a hot fantasy where you're taking them away to be kept as your sexy prisoner. Have fun with banter along these lines - or any other scenario that you two conjure up. </p>\n<p>\nHeighten the teasing by using their favourite sex toy on them while they're handcuffed.

But people still lack confidence about getting dressed up in sexy gear - particularly some of the fetish gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's understandable, no one wants to look foolish, but you shouldn't underestimate the visual impact of wearing sexy things. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips for sizzling in sexy gear: </p>\n<p>\n* When you're with someone new don't slip into something super-kinky - they might feel a bit intimidated. </p>\n<p>\n* Add in sexy gear one step at a time. </p>\n<p>\n* Suggest shopping together to get the balance right - choose anything from sexy-lite to full-on-fetish. </p>\n<p>\n* If you're going to surprise your partner with a hot new outfit think about the things they mention in their fantasies. Do they talk about thigh-high, black patent lace-up boots or little floral dresses? Let those things guide your choices. </p>\n<p>\n* Beware of overdoing it. Sexy stilettos and a short skirt might look amazing. But if you also wear a lace-up basque it might be OTT - you can have too much of a good thing! </p>\n<p>\n* You can get lots of cheap n' cheerful gear or one 'investment' piece, e.g., a gorgeous hand-made basque. Is your partner going to want to have fun ripping it off - like in a bodice-ripping fantasy? Maybe go for the cheap n' cheerful stuff! </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought something sexy to wear - practice flaunting yourself in it on your own. That helps banish feelings that you look silly. Gradually you'll think, Hmmm, I look pretty hot! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 5:</b> Students should never embarrass a partner who's attempted to dress-up for them. You could 'scar' them permanently by telling them they look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Nearly 10% of people say it'd turn them on if their partner dressed up in a uniform. Playing 'doctors and nurses' has never been so much fun now you can pick up these outfits from adult shops. </p>\n<p>\n* Once you've bought an outfit have some fun with a little bit of role-play. </p>\n<p>\n* If you both enjoy sexy dressing-up occasionally go to costume hire shops for some adventurous ideas. </p>\n<p>\n* There is loads of fun gear for men - he might end up strutting around the bedroom in a black leather, studded man's thong. </p>\n<p>\n* If, as a woman, you're not happy about your legs stilettos and high-heeled boots lengthen them - and make you feel super sexy. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe next time you two are 'in the mood' let your partner know you'd like to try a bit of dressing up. Start gently saying something like \"I've fantasised about you wearing old-fashioned stockings and suspenders.\" </p>\n<p>\nThis doesn't feel threatening to them and can plant the beginning of some great ideas. Have fun with it and ask her/him what they think of this - and if they've ever wanted to wear kinky gear. </p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet creative with things you already have that could work well as sexy gear. Pair some very high heels with little frilly knickers - strut around in front of him with you both pretending he's caught you out getting dressed. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: imagination + sexy gear = red hot love! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: What percent of people say they get turned on by spanking - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA/ 15% </p>\n<p>\nB/ 75% </p>\n<p>\nC/ 5% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A/ - 15% of people say they like to include spanking in their sex play. That's potentially a lot of sore bottoms! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nIt's not surprising Amanda Holden always looks radiant after announcing recently she and husband Chris Hughes are expecting a baby. After the devastation of losing their baby son earlier this year they now face a brighter future. </p>\n<p>\nThe fallout from a tragedy breaks up some couples. But those who keep talking and supporting each other - as Amanda and Chris obviously did - can come out the other side fighting and with a stronger relationship. </p>\n<p>\nIf you two are facing a crisis, face it together and support each other. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Courtesan</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a sophisticated position that she can pair-up with some new sexy gear she's bought - like a short miniskirt minus her knickers. </p>\n<p>\nShe sits on a lowish chair or at the end of the bed. He kneels in front of her - on the floor - facing her. Their hips need to be at the same height for full sex. </p>\n<p>\nAs they kiss and cuddle she lifts her legs carefully and wraps them around his lower back. She pulls him in towards her and edges on to the end of the bed or chair. </p>\n<p>\nHe studies her by holding her around her waist. Once they're in position and comfortable he can begin gentle thrusting. </p>\n<p>\nThey may not last long in this position - as she needs quite a bit of strength to keep her legs wrapped around him - but it's an excellent one for them to continue kissing and caressing. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons Week 4: </h1>\n<p>\n<b>Body-image issues that stop you enjoying sex</b> </p>\n<p>\nIn extensive body-image research I found staggering numbers of women insist on lights-off during sex with their fella - over 40 per cent. Heaven knows how many single women - who don't have the trust of a long-term relationship - turn out the lights too! </p>\n<p>\nWhen it came to weight issues the stats were worse - a massive 75 per cent felt overweight. Sadly women think men will heads for the hills at the glimpse of a bulge. </p>\n<p>\nBut it doesn't stop there as now the fellas have body-image issues too. So the Academy aims to banish body hang-ups  men's and women's - from the bedroom. </p>\n<p>\nHere are top tips to boost body confidence - </p>\n<p>\n* Daily remind yourself you're more than what your body looks like - focus on your top personality traits - e.g. you're funny, kind, caring, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Take charge of negative thoughts about your body. Tell yourself nobody's perfect, no one cares about lumps and bumps, etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Face reality: do you want to waste time wishing you had a smaller bum or bigger breasts OR get smart and put your energies into enjoying life - including your sex life? </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Choose your sexiest attribute - maybe your naughty smile or cheeky glint in your eye etc. Value these special lovely little things - and flash that smile. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* Buy things that accentuate your good attributes. Be proud to flaunt those - whether it's your breasts, bottom, legs, shoulders etc. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n* If you genuinely have excess weight do something FUN to get fit, e.g., take some sensual Latin American dance classes. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 4:</b> Each day students should close their eyes for a few moments and visualise themselves as a Sex Goddess or Sex God. Hang onto this hot and sexy image for the rest of the day! </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise: </p>\n<p>\n* Most people simply don't notice what you think are your bad points. </p>\n<p>\n* Research shows sexiness comes from confidence - walk tall, with good posture, pretending to be confident - you'll soon believe it. </p>\n<p>\n* You're not the only one with body issues - that person in bed with you probably feels the same inside. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDevise your own super-hot 'signature sex technique' - take a sexy thing you already do well and make it even hotter. This helps you lose inhibitions - and worries about your body - since you'll feel confident doing your signature technique. </p>\n<p>\nLet's say you're fab at kissing and also pretty good at giving oral sex. Why not devise your very own oral technique that uses your snogging skills? </p>\n<p>\nFor instance if you're great at French kissing apply those techniques 'down below'. You'll have your partner gasping for more - all they'll notice is how great you make them feel. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your technique + extra effort = your signature sex technique! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Test Your Knowledge </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many people feel too embarrassed to talk about sex - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 91% </p>\n<p>\nB) 31% </p>\n<p>\nC) 1% </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is B) - a large survey found 31% of people are too embarrassed to talk about sex even with a partner. If you don't talk to each other you won't get what you want! </p>\n<h1>\n<b>Loved-up Celebs </b>\n</h1>\n<p>\nHollywood hunk Will Smith and wife Jade Pinkett Smith have denied break-up rumours. A couple who always present a united front the splitting-up stories were surprising. </p>\n<p>\nThe strong theme of their love? Definitely the way they keep their family unit tight - forming Team-Smith with children Jaden and Willow. This is the perfect way to handle their stratospheric celebrity status with all its temptations. </p>\n<p>\nCouples should take a page out of their book and protect their love by creating some 'team spirit' between them. </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Spoons </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a great position for anyone overcoming body confidence issues because neither of you gets a good look at each other's bodies. </p>\n<p>\nBoth of you lie on your sides, the man behind, the curve of her back and bottom snuggled into the curve of his stomach and chest. She parts her legs for full sex. </p>\n<p>\nBy alternating how high she lifts her top leg it varies the friction they feel. He can carry on with foreplay with his arms wrapped around her - easy to run his hands over her erogenous zones. </p>\n<p>\nThe Spoons is versatile and ideal for a slow, sensual or more vigorous sex. Plus it also hits the spot - the g-spot. </p>\n<p>\nDr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>. </p>\n<p>\nFor more advice visit www.drpam.co.uk</a>. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nSex Lessons: Week 3 </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Great Climax Guide - how to bring her to oh-oh-heaven!</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt any given time somewhere in the region of 70 per cent of women having sex aren't reaching climax. And only about 15 per cent climax regularly. Those statistics equal a whole load of disappointment! But we can change this today. </p>\n<p>\nHere are some pointers every good student should learn - the first section is for the girls (but the guys should take a peak): </p>\n<p>\n* Reject thoughts that you'll \"never climax\" - it's easy to slip into a negative mindset when you've never climaxed with a man. </p>\n<p>\n*Even if you're with a partner where it's never happened, tell yourself \"I'm going to start afresh and be positive - it can happen if I relax about it!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n*Women should know how their body works. The best way forward is letting your fingers do the walking through self-pleasure. Men are masters of this - high time women became the mistresses of their bodies too. </p>\n<p>\n*Self-pleasure arms you with knowledge you then share with a partner. </p>\n<p>\n*Relax in a warm bath, the shower, or in bed with the lights down low. Maybe light a candle, put on some mood music and explore your body. </p>\n<p>\n*Share the sensations you discover with him the next time you're together. </p>\n<p>\nAnd for the guys: </p>\n<p>\n*Sorry guys, you may think you're Mr. Lover-man but what you think works may not work for her! </p>\n<p>\n* Help her relax and tell her to take her time. </p>\n<p>\n*Ask her what you can do to help bring her along. </p>\n<p>\n*She might feel embarrassed because it takes time to climax but reassurance will go a long way. </p>\n<p>\n*Really listen to her suggestions - hopefully she knows what works for her - she just needs to share it. </p>\n<p>\n*Don't get stressed-out if it takes some time getting to know what works for her. Treat it as sex-perimentation! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 3:</b> Students shouldn't fake orgasms - it seems okay when you don't want to \"hurt his feelings\" because you're tired and it's just not going to happen. But in the long run honesty's best. There's nothing wrong with enjoying sex-play knowing you're too tired for it to end in a climax. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's time to apply your new knowledge  </p>\n<p>\nGet started with lashings of foreplay for her. Take your time showering her with kisses. Definitely kiss around the back of her neck and ears - unless she's supersensitive this is oh-oh-heavenly. </p>\n<p>\nStroke her lightly with your fingers - you build more sexual tension swirling them gently all over her body. Build to a firmer touch checking that she wants it. </p>\n<p>\nPretend you're her \"sex doctor\" discovering what makes her \"feel better\". Turning exploring her body into foreplay. Keep asking her what feels good and where. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you're both ready for full sex let her select the position - all students should check out my recommendation below. Give her \"permission\" to take charge of the action. Remember you can always have your pleasure once she has hers! </p>\n<p>\nThe must-know equation: understanding your body + sharing that knowledge = climax guaranteed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: By the time a couple's been together two years how much less sex do they have then when they first met? Is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 10% less sex </p>\n<p>\nB) 90% less sex </p>\n<p>\nC) 50% less sex </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is C) - they have half as much sex as when they were in the hot honeymoon phase! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSometimes a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do in the name of love! </p>\n<p>\nThe Hoff's girlfriend Hayden Roberts quit her job behind Debenham's makeup counter because bosses wouldn't give her enough time off to spend with David. It must've been makeup brushes at dawn as she stood up for her love. </p>\n<p>\nIn this case she's got her priorities right because sometimes love has to come first. I hear from too many women with bitter regrets having put their careers first. </p>\n<p>\nYou've got to look at the circumstances and sometimes they're so unique you need to make tough decisions. </p>\n<p>\nHow many Hollywood hunks - even the ageing ones - is Haley going to meet? And heck the Hoff looks like fun now he's cleaned up his act! </p>\n<p>\nIf things ever go pear-shaped and Haley doesn't get her happy-ever-after with the Hoff she's smart enough to know that there are other make-up counters and department stores - and men - out there. Food for thought if you find yourself weighing up the pros and cons of whether someone's worth making sacrifices for. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The CAT</b> </p>\n<p>\nThe Coital Alignment Technique (or Clitoral Alignment Technique as some call it) is the perfect choice this week  it's simple yet almost guaranteed to give her a climax. </p>\n<p>\nShe can either be on top or the bottom - but if she has difficulty climaxing I recommend she goes on top. He lies flat on the bed, her on top - sort of a \"reversed\" missionary position. She can have her legs inside his or outside of his. </p>\n<p>\nHaving them inside his legs squeezes his penis [edit, manhood?] fairly tightly so she should be careful how much pressure she uses. She then shimmies a couple centimetres up his pelvis so that her pubic bone rubs against his pubic bone. </p>\n<p>\nHe can reach around her hips and hold her in place - for a little added pleasure he can squeeze her buttocks gently. She controls the action using small circular or rocking movements. </p>\n<p>\nThe CAT allows her full control of the sensations she gets. It also slows him down so he doesn't climax too quickly allowing her to get the right stimulation to climax. </p>\n<p>\nIf he's a bit lazy he can have a rest while she goes on top and takes over! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dr Pam's latest sex guide is available HERE</a>.

A whopping 94 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women confess to them... the rest are fibbing saying they don't have them. </p>\n<p>\nSo today's lesson is all about fantasy-chat to spice things up. </p>\n<p>\nTiming's crucial - if your partner's just confessed undying love it's not the best time to mention your kinky bondage fantasy. But in the middle of fun foreplay? Definitely ask if they have \"naughty thoughts\" about secret desires. Using words like \"naughty thoughts\" is gentler than diving-in asking about fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nUse what you're already doing to kickstart fantasy-chat. If you're gently rubbing massage oil on them describe lying on a tropical beach and they're a sexy stranger who comes over to flirt. They begin rubbing suntan oil into you - you end up slipping off for amazing sex. Hopefully such chat will get your partner in the mood for sharing their fantasies. </p>\n<p>\nVariety's the spice of life - don't always describe the same scenario as that can get boring. The whole point of fantasy-sharing is roaming into fresh territory. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Academy Rule No. 2:</b> Students shouldn't upset a partner by describing fantasies of sex with their fave celeb or a hot fantasy about your neighbour! No, no, a 1000 times no - it's very bad bedroom manners. Your partner should feature prominently in your fantasies - at least the ones you share with them. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist every good student should memorise. </p>\n<p>\nA healthy fantasy life has benefits: </p>\n<p>\n* It helps you escape sexual boredom </p>\n<p>\n* You get double the pleasure - you share your secret fantasies and they share theirs </p>\n<p>\n* When your partner's away fantasy-chat makes phone-sex more fun </p>\n<p>\n* In your private fantasies you can be with anyone - even people you'll never meet like your favourite celeb </p>\n<p>\n* Sharing fantasies gives you two fresh ideas to try - like some role-play </p>\n<p>\n* It's free! </p>\n<p>\n<b>Your Hot Homework: </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nTime to apply your new knowledge  when feeling confident to share your fantasy, describe one that boosts your partner's sexual confidence. </p>\n<p>\nToday's homework is to dream one up ahead of time - then when you're next in bed together whisper, e.g., \"You're so gorgeous I fantasise I'm a photographer and you're a model. I chat you up and start undressing you.\" This type of fantasy makes them feel fab - and that's the point. </p>\n<p>\nOne of you is probably more confident so by all means \"go first\" describing your fantasy. But emphasise you really want to hear theirs. Turn it into a game where you have to guess their fantasy. This can reveal all sorts of juicy stuff to chat about. </p>\n<p>\nAnother great game is taking turns deciding the next twist in a fantasy scenario. E.g. you start by describing how you get lost and go into a bar to ask directions. </p>\n<p>\nNo prize for guessing there's a really sexy stranger (who looks like your partner - remember your manners!) sitting at the bar who starts chatting you up. Now your partner says what happens next, and so on. </p>\n<p>\nThe equation: your fantasies + their fantasies = endless fun in bed! </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many under-30s have had sex with a friend - in other words \"friends with fringe benefits\"- is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 66 % </p>\n<p>\nB) 6 % </p>\n<p>\nC) 36 % </p>\n<p>\nTest Your Knowledge answer: The correct answer is A) - one study found a whopping two thirds of under-30s has been more-than-friendly with a friend! The 50+ generation's at it too, with nine per cent confessing to sex with a friend recently. </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nKate Moss has joined new hubby Jamie Hince on tour Down Under. Like most newlyweds smack in the middle of the honeymoon phase they can't bear to be apart. But it's the transition from hot honeymoon phase to long-term love - with all its ups and downs, that's tricky. </p>\n<p>\nWhen you feel the fizz and fun fading that's when you should show a little extra love, attention and affection. </p>\n<p>\nDon't neglect each other but be realistic about finding a balance between what you once had - complete 'hot-ness'. And something lasting - a loving warmth where you occasionally turn up the heat! </p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>The Strip Search</b> </p>\n<p>\nPerfect to try after the fantasy lesson above.

Inside you get a bit paranoid thinking: \"Am I a sex maniac, wanting too much?\" Or \"Don't they fancy me anymore?\" </p>\n<p>\nWomen are particularly bad about blaming themselves when he loses interest. Whereas the fellas are less worried about blame - they just want to sort out more sex! </p>\n<p>\nAcademy rule No. 1: Don't point the finger of blame for lack of sex at yourself or your partner. You're in this together, you'll sort it together. </p>\n<p>\nHere's a checklist of passion-killing culprits every good student should consider: </p>\n<p>\n* Problems in your relationship (at each other's throats and you won't be at it!) </p>\n<p>\n* Trouble at work/financial worries </p>\n<p>\n* Not enough sleep or time together (a good chance the Beckham's are experiencing this one) </p>\n<p>\n* Too many late nights including too much booze and cigs </p>\n<p>\n* Boredom with the same old sex and/or feeling shy about trying new things </p>\n<p>\n* Medical problems and/or side-effects of prescription medication </p>\n<p>\n* Stress, anxiety and/or depression (face it, when you're down you don't feel sexy) </p>\n<p>\n* Erectile difficulties for the man meaning he avoids sex </p>\n<p>\nMost of these affect the way you feel and think i.e. your brain action. Research shows how powerfully our brains affect sexual desire. </p>\n<p>\nPut a hot, naked woman in front of a depressed man and his brain won't switch on his arousal centre. What hope has his wife of five, ten, or more, years got? </p>\n<h3>\nHot &amp; Helpful Homework: </h3>\n<p>\nIt's time for applying your new knowledge - thoroughly examine the checklist and get stuck in with the main culprit. If a number of these are affecting your sex life, focus on changing one at a time. </p>\n<p>\nStudy example: Let's say you're having lots of arguments plus partying too much at weekends - ending up hungover. </p>\n<p>\nWhen calm, agree with each other that the arguing must stop. Then look at what starts arguments (Household chores? Money?) and work out solutions together. </p>\n<p>\nBe the first to be affectionate and loving to your partner despite the rows. Making these efforts will have big payoffs. </p>\n<p>\nThinking of our example - arguments and partying  next knock excess drinking on the head. A hangover on a Sunday morning doesn't lead to Sunday afternoon delight! Agree a drinks limit and help each other stick to it. </p>\n<p>\nWhen things are better, recharge the spark. Make regular time for each other, get cosy on the settee, and whisper in their ear how much you miss that \"thing\" they do best in bed. </p>\n<p>\nTease them a little, let your fingertips gently run over their erogenous zones, and keep up the sexy banter. Full sex should be back on the agenda soon. But consult your GP about ongoing health issues that might affect desire. </p>\n<h1>\nTest Your Knowledge </h1>\n<p>\nQ: How many couples now regularly use oral sex to guarantee the woman's satisfaction - is it: </p>\n<p>\nA) 45% </p>\n<p>\nB) 20% </p>\n<p>\nC) 69% </p>\n<p>\nA: The correct answer is B. Twenty per cent of men in a relationship now use oral sex to make sure their partner has a good time between the sheets - just what the doctor ordered! </p>\n<h1>\nLoved-up Celebs </h1>\n<p>\nSo Brad and Angelina are getting hitched six years and six children into their relationship.

Relationship research shows couples that leave getting married longer than 3 1/2 years are pretty much doomed. </p>\n<p>\nAny why? Because leaving it that long suggests one of them's dragged their feet about fully committing¿ whether it's her Jimmy Choo-clad feet daintily dodging the aisle we may never know. </p>\n<p>\nJust beware the partner who keeps putting off full commitment. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nDr Pam's Position </h1>\n<p>\n<b>This fortnight:</b> <b>The Cow Girl</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nHave loads of fun with this position where the girl's on top.

Mark says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Sophie was nine she got a fairly typical virus which lasted two to three weeks. </p>\n<p>\nBut she never really recovered. </p>\n<p>\nShe suffered crippling gastric problems, heartburn and acid reflux, as well as a general lack of energy. </p>\n<p>\nThe GPs we saw tried to deal with the symptoms rather than the root cause. </p>\n<p>\nAs parents we had no knowledge of ME, so while seeing countless consultants we never thought to ask about it. </p>\n<p>\nWe simply thought it was something people got in the Eighties and it made you feel like you had flu. </p>\n<p>\nWe certainly didn't know you could treat it. </p>\n<p>\nSophie was getting worse and worse to the point where she couldn't eat and was increasingly bedbound. </p>\n<p>\nThen, about two years ago, one consultant suggested ME and, after researching it ourselves, it all made sense. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt took up to six years to get an accurate diagnosis but sadly, by then, having pushed herself so hard for six years, Sophie's batteries were completely run down. </p>\n<p>\nIt felt like we'd missed our window of opportunity when we could have done something. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Karen has given up her job as a shelf-stacker at Sainsbury's to be her full-time carer. </p>\n<p>\nThe slightest thing exhausts Sophie and because it's neurological, it affects every part of her body. </p>\n<p>\nShe can't watch TV or use a laptop because she's light intolerant. It makes her dizzy or ill. </p>\n<p>\nShe can't read more than a couple of times a day and she hasn't been downstairs for more than a year. </p>\n<p>\nWe can't speak to her for more than a few minutes at a time because it drains her energy. </p>\n<p>\nHer room has to be dark and she needs help getting to the loo as she's too wobbly on her feet. </p>\n<p>\nShe can read texts but can't type herself because her brain can't co-ordinate her fingers. </p>\n<p>\nEating and chewing is now almost impossible for her, so she has a tube which feeds liquidised food through her nose, but she can drink herself. </p>\n<p>\nWe're trying to step up the little achievements she can manage each day  exposing her to a little more light, getting her to eat a little food herself. </p>\n<p>\nBut if we push her too hard she relapses badly and we're back at square one. </p>\n<p>\nWe can't have visitors to the house at all now because of any potential disruption. The best Karen and I can hope for in terms of our own lives is a walk and a coffee when Sophie's brother Matt, who is 29, comes round. </p>\n<p>\nThis makes Sophie feel terribly guilty too  ME impacts hugely on everyone. </p>\n<p>\nBut throughout Sophie's been bright and cheerful, always with a smile on her face. </p>\n<p>\nMeeting other people through the Association of Young People with ME (AYME) has helped us realise we're not alone and often people do get better We've met people in their twenties who are leading largely normal, happy lives, who were once like Sophie is now. </p>\n<p>\nThey are our inspiration to keep going. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nJamie, 23 </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>JAMIE STRONG, from Kingston upon Thames, is determined to end the stigma surrounding ME. He says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nFive years ago I regularly lapped the eight miles or so around Richmond Park on my bike. As a healthy, active 17-year-old, I enjoyed hanging out with my mates, running and pumping iron at the gym. </p>\n<p>\nThen in January 2007 my whole world came crashing down. </p>\n<p>\nOut of the blue I started having severe stomach pain with bleeding. </p>\n<p>\nI was diagnosed with probable gastroenteritis and, after a colonoscopy, ulcerative colitis. </p>\n<p>\nI started to get joint pain and brain fog. </p>\n<p>\nI struggled through my A-levels but by September I was having trouble standing. </p>\n<p>\nI was collapsing all over the place and had to postpone my place at university. </p>\n<p>\nNext I was diagnosed with Addison's disease, which is a lack of pituitary hormones in the body. </p>\n<p>\nI was given more medication, which helped me go off to the University of East Anglia, but my short-term memory was letting me down and I felt exhausted. </p>\n<p>\nSix weeks after I started, my parents had to come and take me home. It was then that I received the diagnosis of ME. </p>\n<p>\nME is sometimes called chronic fatigue syndrome. But fatigue doesn't come close to what I have. </p>\n<p>\nMost mornings I wake up  if I manage to sleep at all  feeling more drained than when I went to bed. </p>\n<p>\nI often experience near-paralysis in my legs. If I manage to get myself in the bath, I then have to lie on the bath mat for 20 minutes before I can stand up. </p>\n<p>\nGoing up the stairs feels like I'm climbing Everest. </p>\n<p>\nEven reading or a conversation can be too much for me now. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I try to keep going, the exhaustion can become so extreme that I feel as if I'm about to die. It's like my brain is on fire. </p>\n<p>\nI have burning muscle pain and painkillers bring little relief. When this happens, the only way to survive is to lie in a dark, silent room. </p>\n<p>\nI desperately miss friends my own age. They no longer see me since they don't understand why I can do so little or why the doctors can't help me. </p>\n<p>\nI've made contact with other young people with ME but mostly they are too ill to meet. I can leave the house once or twice a week if someone is taking me and I don't have to walk far. Sometimes I use a wheelchair. </p>\n<p>\nI've tried everything to get my health back  alternative therapies, acupuncture, diet, supplements, cognitive behavioural therapy, increasing activity levels, relaxation techniques, meditation, resting, pacing and medication. </p>\n<p>\nTo live this life with no end in sight feels like a living death. </p>\n<p>\nIf only people would realise this is a real, devastating physical illness, then those with ME wouldn't feel so abandoned, dismissed and belittled. </p>\n<p>\nWe need the Government to treat this as the serious illness it is, to educate doctors and to instigate more research so that proper treatments  possibly a cure  can be found. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nLinda, 52 </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>OCCUPATIONAL therapist Linda Horncastle was crippled by pain caused by fibromyalgia for nearly two decades. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>She even contemplated suicide to spare her family the burden of looking after her. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda, from Seer Green, Bucks, says:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nI first fell ill aged 27, after the birth of my son Matthew. I saw a specialist who said it was a trapped nerve and gave me pain-killers, but it didn't get any better. </p>\n<p>\nThe pain spread across to my other shoulder, down my back and I felt so utterly tired all the time. </p>\n<p>\nFour years after Matthew was born I had my second son, Steven, by which time I couldn't lift either of them up. </p>\n<p>\nIf they wanted a hug, they'd have to climb on to my knees. </p>\n<p>\nI was completely dependent on my husband David, now 52, and friends to help me with the kids. I finally found out what was wrong with me when I was 33. </p>\n<p>\nWe were living in France and a GP referred me to a rheumatologist who said I had fibromyalgia. </p>\n<p>\nHe advised I visit some thermal baths and make changes to my diet. But then David's job was transferred back to the UK and the stress of moving made my symptoms worse. </p>\n<p>\nI was housebound for days on end. I didn't have the energy to do the school run and I was in constant, agonising pain. </p>\n<p>\nMy family was suffering so much because of me. </p>\n<p>\nDavid had to do all the cooking and housework. Normal things such as family holidays and after-school clubs weren't an option for Matthew and Steven. </p>\n<p>\nI felt so guilty I twice contemplated suicide, thinking they'd all be better off without me. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI'd lost almost all my friends because I couldn't leave the house. I had panic attacks whenever I went on public transport. </p>\n<p>\nThe turning point was reading an article by a physiotherapist who'd been similarly debilitated by fibromyalgia. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained how she had got her life back and even started work again with stretching exercises combined with cutting out sugar, caffeine and gluten from her diet. </p>\n<p>\nI made all these changes and went to a pain clinic where I learnt relaxation techniques so I didn't burn myself out. </p>\n<p>\nMy symptoms improved by around 40 per cent, but I was still far from well again. A doctor suggested I try a device called an Alpha-Stim. </p>\n<p>\nThis uses a small electrical current to produce alpha waves which stop my brain getting more pain signals than it should. </p>\n<p>\nBy the end of the second week of using it I was feeling much better. I slept well for the first time in decades and my energy and pain levels improved. </p>\n<p>\nI even started work again in 2010, which I never in a million years thought would happen. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>For more information see ukfibromyalgia.com</a> and meassociation.org.uk</a>. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/health/health/3869083/Is-your-tiredness-down-to-thyroid.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Is your tiredness down to thyroid?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4017963/France-advises-women-to-get-risky-breast-implants-removed.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"France advises women to get risky breast implants removed"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01479/SOPHIEM-532_1479882a.jpg","caption":"Once so vibrant ...

It's incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n\"<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I'd try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n\"For breakfast, I'd have four slices of toast. For lunch I'd make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n\"Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I'd never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n\"Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: \"I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn't dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n\"So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges  you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n\"Worth more than &#163;3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class  purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n\"So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I'd done. It was the motivation I needed to carry on,\" she says. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Comparing myself month by month stunned me. My face was thinner and I could notice the difference in my waistline and arms.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I began looking forward to each month when the time came to take a picture and compare myself to the previous one.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola also joined women-only gym Curves and began working out twice a week. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"After the first year I'd lost five stone  down from 24st to 19st. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My meals changed completely to consist of a piece of toast for breakfast, a sandwich with two pieces of brown bread for lunch, fruit for a snack and meat with vegetables for dinner. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking at myself filled me with pride and the compliments I was receiving from friends and family were incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was determined this wasn't going to just be a fad diet phase  this was a new lifestyle for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the next three years she lost a further six stone, dropping to 13st 2lb. </p>\n<p>\nNicola says: \"Every woman wants to look their best in a photo. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I was ever tempted to have a take-away binge at the end of the month, I'd think about having my picture taken and it would put me off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd for shoe-mad Nicola there was only one way to mark her sensational new figure. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In January this year I splashed out on a beautiful pair of &#163;380 cream Jimmy Choo shoes to celebrate.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4210484/Ive-tried-61-different-diets-since-I-was-13.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"I've tried 61 different diets since I was 13"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Why we're all tee totally happy"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4201637/My-8-year-takeaway-binge-cost-25kand-my-unborn-babys-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My 8-year takeaway binge cost £25k...and my unborn baby's life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I'm proud to be UK average size 16.

Forget heavy tans, thick layers of foundation and cakey bronzer  radiance is now the key word in the beauty world. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Catwalk models have all been given little else but radiant, glowing skin, while celebrities such as Natalie Portman are setting the precedent for softer, fresher looks. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>If YOU fancy brightening your complexion, a few simple tricks can lift your skin. </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>LAUREN NAYLOR shares her skin secrets so you can get up and glow. </b>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nSkin perfection </h1>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\nLET'S face it, we'd all love to feel confident make-up free and be blessed with a radiant, glowy complexion. </p>\n<p>\nBut daily exposure to harsh elements can make it difficult to pull off. Look out for nourishing and calming skincare ingredients to give your skin radiance and combat dryness and redness. </p>\n<p>\nHead therapist Sherelle at celebrity skin care spa Linda Meredith, whose clients include Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow, says: \"Start by using a cleanser packed full of naturally occurring vitamins, omega oils and amino acids. </p>\n<p>\n\"We are exposed to various chemicals throughout our day so look for paraben-free formulas. </p>\n<p>\n\"Take a generous amount of cleansing product mixed with warm water and with a feather-soft touch gently massage the product in with your fingertips. </p>\n<p>\n\"By massaging softly you are pushing the product into your skin rather than moving facial muscles about aggressively. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the warm water heats the skin for the products to penetrate deeper. When you rinse, use a soft sponge, gentle cotton wool pads or your hands  flannels are too abrasive. </p>\n<p>\n\"An old-school, tried-and-tested method that we use is to give your skin a deep steam once a week over the basin. This will help open up and deep-clean any clogged pores. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing wrong with squeezing out blackheads  just make sure you take a thick piece of tissue and use the sides of your fingertips to push them out. </p>\n<p>\n\"Only do this for three to five minutes max. If they won't come, they're not ready, and if you use your fingernails you will break and damage your skin.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe love <b>REN Hydra-Calm Cleansing Milk</b> with peroxidase enzymes from fennel seed extract to protect distressed skin and Omega 3 and 7 essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation, &#163;18. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Linda Meredith Paraben-free Cream Cleanser</b> with avocado and citrus fruit oils, &#163;39 <i>(stockists, 020 7225 2755)</i>.

Look for natural ingredients that gently slough off dead skin. </p>\n<p>\nWalnut shell, papaya and pineapple are all fantastic natural exfoliators. Try <b>Origins Never A Dull Moment</b> skin-brightening polisher with fruit extracts to help reveal a healthy glow, &#163;24 <i>(Origins)</i>. </p>\n<p>\nPut your feet up and slather on <b>Elemis Papaya Enzyme Peel</b>, &#163;28.60 <i>(Elemis counters)</i>.

You can layer under make-up or wear stand-alone. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are going out and want to appear more made up, try adding highlighter along the cheekbones, down the bridge of the nose and on the forehead  this gives a shimmering dewiness. </p>\n<p>\nYou can also place highlighter on the brow bone and under the arch of the brow to make your eyes appear brighter. </p>\n<p>\n<b>L'Oreal Lumi Magique Concealer</b>, &#163;8.49, <i>(Boots)</i> will help to brighten the eyes if you dab a small amount in the darkest areas, ie, underneath, and <b>Bobbi Brown Creamy Concealer</b> in Chestnut, &#163;17, is great for darker skins.

Everyone recognised that. </p>\n<p>\n\"We felt the brunt of it when they beat us 6-1. </p>\n<p>\n\"But a season lasts for a bit longer than three months.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow United are top most have them down as favourites with their form and experience of these title situations. </p>\n<p>\nFerguson said last weekend that it was time for Mancini to feel the full wrath of squeaky-bum time after leading for so long. </p>\n<p>\nYet the Old Trafford chief received an unwelcome warning on Monday night to prove he is still not immune to the condition himself as United almost threw away two points at home to Fulham. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Well, when we started to give that ball away it nearly got it going.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited supporters may have ended the evening celebrating a vital 1-0 win at a crunch stage of the season. </p>\n<p>\nBut inside the home dressing room the atmosphere was very different. </p>\n<p>\nFerguson was furious with the way his team were losing possession in the closing moments of the game. </p>\n<p>\nThat was why he tore down to his technical area to gesticulate with his stars and start jabbing his watch to urge the final whistle. He said: \"You have no idea the amount of work we do on possession in our training sessions. </p>\n<p>\n\"And then for a 10-minute period everyone on that pitch started giving the ball away! </p>\n<p>\n\"So I think my visibility is important at that time. </p>\n<p>\n\"I knew at that point that winning was the name of the game, because we were not going to score any more goals. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"We had a fantastic period after half-time actually when we didn't kill them off. The goalkeeper pulled off two fantastic saves and there was one blocked on the line. I thought at that point we were going to kill them off. </p>\n<p>\n\"And then you saw in that last 15 minutes anxiety crept in and we started giving the ball away. </p>\n<p>\n\"So it was a lesson in keeping possession of the ball which we are usually very good at it. But on Monday it let them down a wee bit.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe players knew the boss was not happy with their sloppiness and could sense a dressing-room hairdryer on the way. </p>\n<p>\nFerguson said: \"I think some of them were trying to dodge to the other side of the ground!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a sign to Fergie that even his side can be gripped with nerves in this mother of all title battles with their rivals. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"Exactly, exactly. You just need to get over the finishing line. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The players knew that a win would put us three points clear of City. It was an important day for us.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited could have blown it had referee Michael Oliver had a better view of Michael Carrick's challenge on Danny Murphy which should have led to a last-gasp Fulham penalty. </p>\n<p>\nFerguson admits they were fortunate to get away with it. He said: \"From looking at the referee's position I can see why he didn't give a penalty kick when Danny Murphy was brought down. </p>\n<p>\n\"The ball has moved at an angle as Michael Carrick tackles him and from his position it wasn't clear, although it was a good claim.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nUnited could be deposed at the top tomorrow on goal difference with City taking on Sunderland at the Etihad. </p>\n<p>\nThe Red Devils will immediately regain control with a draw or a win at Ewood Park on Monday when they take on Blackburn. </p>\n<p>\nIt is nip and tuck but Ferguson believes that the experience of his veterans could prove key. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I think the Ferdinands, Giggs and Scholes help that situation. </p>\n<p>\n\"If they were to lose their nerve, then we would be in trouble, but I don't expect that. I think they are well accustomed to it. </p>\n<p>\n\"Of course, we know football can turn round and bite you. </p>\n<p>\n\"That is the point we make about experience  hopefully that helps us. We have a small advantage, not a great advantage, but that can be changed in one game so we just have to take each game as it comes. </p>\n<p>\n\"That is the only thing I can do. The approach now is that once the Fulham game is over all the concentration is on Monday night at Blackburn. </p>\n<p>\n\"And after that the concentration will be on next Sunday's game against QPR. So that's the best way of handling it.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4228419/Alex-Ferguson-suggests-Patrick-Vieira-could-face-FA-charge-for-slur.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Gag Pat"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4227667/Roberto-Mancini-bike-scare-as-big-red-machine-closes-on-Man-City-boss.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Red machine gives Mancini the wobbles"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4227834/Alex-Ferguson-says-Blackburn-fans-got-it-wrong-over-Steve-Kean.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fergie dig at Rovers fans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4226973/Man-Utd-boss-Alex-Ferguson-Luck-evens-itself-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fergie: Luck evens out"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4226232/Rio-Ferdinand-hits-back-at-Patrick-Vieira-as-title-race-heats-up.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Shut it!"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4228476/Carlos-Tevez-is-ready-to-replace-crocked-Sergio-Aguero-for-Manchester-City.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Tevez in for Serg"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4228396/Roberto-Mancini-admits-he-is-a-big-fan-of-Luka-Modric.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"City's sights on Modric"}],"video":[{"uri":"p5dXBiNDoOPVK9jze-drPtdEci3WpMfk","js":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=p5dXBiNDoOPVK9jze-drPtdEci3WpMfk&deepLinkEmbedCode=p5dXBiNDoOPVK9jze-drPtdEci3WpMfk\"></script>","caption":"ALEX FERGUSON insists lucky breaks evens itself out after Vieira comments"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01480/86_ferg_1480717a.jpg","caption":"IN FOR THE LONG HAUL ...

We have spent a lot of money on players and we have a fantastic squad. Now we have to justify that and get the results we need to deliver the title.</p>\n<p>\"Because of the money everyone has been expecting us to succeed. That will be very tough now.</p>\n<p>\"But I have lost everything else this season  the African Cup of Nations, Champions League, the Europa League, FA Cup and Carling Cup.</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to lose the Premier League, too, so I will fight until the finish.\"</p>\n<p>And Toure believes his team-mates will also rise to the challenge.</p>\n<p>The Ivory Coast star added: \"Players like Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Mario Balotelli have come here with me to City for one thing.</p>\n<p>\"Not for money  but to win games and win trophies.</p>\n<p>\"And I hope this year we will take the Premier League because it is the last step we have to take.

That's why people all around the world love the Premier League  you never know if United, City or Chelsea are going to win and that's great.\" City can return to the top tomorrow if they beat Sunderland at Eastlands  but only briefly as United play at Blackburn on Monday night.</p>\n<p>So Toure knows the big Manchester derby showdown at City on April 30 could be crucial to the destination of the Premier League trophy.</p>\n<p>He added: \"We know Manchester United are a fantastically strong team with fantastic experience  more than any other team  so it will be very, very tough.</p>\n<p>\"They are incredible. United are not the type of team who you can give anything to. When they are first they usually stay like that until the finish.</p>\n<p>\"And when you look at their programme they have easier games than us. Maybe their only difficult game is away to us. So we know it will be hard.</p>\n<p>\"That's why we need to concentrate and stay focused. That's why we must fight until the finish.\"</p>\n<p>Toure reckons City have an ace up their sleeve with Carlos Tevez returning. He said: \"If we win the Premier League this year it would be amazing for the club and the fans.</p>\n<p>And with Carlos back everything can be nice.\"</p>\n<p>And Toure is drawing on his experience of winning the title with Barcelona as he attempts to add another championship to his CV.</p>\n<p>It would be a glorious finale to a frustrating season so far in terms of silverware.</p>\n<p>He added: \"When you go to a final, finals are for winning so I was really disappointed.</p>\n<p>\"What we did at Barca was a perfect example of what we need to do now. The thing at the Nou Camp was that we had known each other for two years.</p>\n<p>\"We played together for two years and in the second year we won everything, picking up six cups.</p>\n<p>\"We were strong together. This time of year will be tough for City but we are out of the other trophies and now we will be getting more rest. At Barca we managed to get Xavi, Iniesta and Messi all fit and that made everything easier.</p>\n<p>\"With City, Aguero missed the Stoke game with a little injury but he will be fit for Sunderland.</p>\n<p>\"Hopefully we can get everyone fit and take it game by game.</p>\n<p>\"We know it will be hard because United are a big club and have the experience of this.</p>\n<p>\"We need to concentrate and stay focused.\" Toure makes it clear City's multi-million pound signings need to be united to pip their neighbours to the title.</p>\n<p>The midfielder added: \"The most important thing is that we all go the same way now.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, you have to prepare your mind and yourself for disappointments.

Though not once denying that he <b>HAD</b> said them.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnyway, surely it's Ferguson's job to fall out with the Beeb?\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe stats reveal that United have conceded nine league penalties at home since the start of the 2006-2007 season, City just one more.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe sides with the least are Chelsea and Aston Villa (six) and Liverpool (seven).\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOnce again, it was manna from heaven for Ferguson.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWhile it's all starting to get a bit childish, with tit-for-tat claim and counter-claim, he did make the point that a City executive should not be commenting on referees.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe last thing City need is to present such an inviting target to the old master of trench warfare, an expert in destabilising the opposition and never more so than when there's a title at stake.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIt has not been a good time for City, with many of their less one-eyed supporters fearing that they have already blown their first championship in more than 40 years.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHaving once had a hefty lead at the top of the table, they now trail United by three points after dropping 13 in 13 games.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOnce again, Roberto Mancini is under intense pressure  not helped by his latest training-ground run-in with the apparently unhinged Mario Balotelli.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThrow in a United record of 28 points from 30, the untimely absence from their defence of skipper Vincent Kompany and Spanish midfielder David Silva's equally untimely drop in form and it is no wonder City's nerves are playing up.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNot that we should have too much sympathy for them, since they probably started it all with the gloating 'Welcome to Manchester' hoardings when they signed Tevez, prompting Ferguson's 'noisy neighbours' response.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nVarious crass statements from former chief executive Garry Cook did not help, either.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYet United are hardly wide-eyed innocents.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nStirrer-in-chief has been Rio Ferdinand, who replied to Vieira's latest gaffe by tweeting 'Why is Vieira so concerned with Man United . . . .2 comments in a week or so . . . c'mon maaaaaaan let it go!' This, though, was almost tame compared to Ferdinand's deliberate wind-up a few weeks ago when he said: \"Walking round town, you see far more blue shirts than you probably would have seen over the last 10 years.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n\"Success somehow brings people out of the woodwork.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat would have been particularly galling to all those City fans who have followed the club through thick and thin, while United were churning out one title after another and adding fresh names to the Surrey branch of the United Supporters' Club.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAnd so it all goes on. City entertain Sunderland tomorrow, with United travelling to Blackburn on Monday.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nIf, as Ferguson suggested yesterday, refereeing decisions tend to even themselves out over a season, City fans can comfort themselves with one image.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThe look on the United manager's face as he struggles to control the volcano if one goes the other way at Ewood Park.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nNev court short </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nGARY NEVILLE could be found in the early hours of Wednesday morning surrounded by a bevy of swooning football writers in the lounge of a Lisbon hotel. </p>\n<p>\nThe apparent love-in was only disturbed by one cynical old hack wandering by, muttering: \"Ah, the king surrounded by his court.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday, TV pundit Neville refused to speak to journalists at the Soccerex forum in Manchester saying: \"This has trouble written all over it\". </p>\n<p>\nHe had just given a talk on, erm, 'Football and the media'... </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nThat's crafty </h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCRAFTY Italians, Part Two. </p>\n<p>\nThere was a lot of praise for AC Milan's defending and how they prevented Barcelona playing on Wednesday. </p>\n<p>\nBut the real star was the San Siro groundsman after preparing the sort of heavy pitch that had Arsene Wenger complaining the night before Arsenal's 4-0 defeat. </p>\n<p>\nThe surface was not just stodgy and well-watered but the grass so long Pep Guardiola almost had to send out search parties for Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. </p>\n<p>\nThese players normally float over the ground. </p>\n<p>\nBut they not only failed to control the ball but keep their feet. </p>\n<p>\nFor a while, you thought they were just having an off-night.

None has even been extended into a fifth day.</p>\n<p>If they lose the Second Test in Colombo next week, England will surrender their world No 1 ranking to South Africa.</p>\n<p>It is the first crisis for head coach Andy Flower, who must decide whether the current group of batsmen will ever have the nous to succeed on turning pitches in Asia.</p>\n<p>Captain Andrew Strauss will assess his plans when he returns home next month. He is likely to stay in his job. But this sequence of losses, and a personal record of one century in 48 Test innings, is applying plenty of pressure.</p>\n<p>Strauss refused to be drawn on his future. That is fair enough. After all, this is a man with two Ashes triumphs in charge of the world's top team, though some tough decisions lie ahead.</p>\n<p>He is due to play his 100th Test at the end of the summer and that could be the moment he decides to hang up his bat.</p>\n<p>There was a time yesterday when Trott and Matt Prior were at the crease and England were dreaming of achieving their highest-ever fourth innings run chase of 340.</p>\n<p>Yet after Prior was freakishly caught at short leg from a full-blooded sweep, the end was swift. England's final six wickets fell for 31 runs in 13.1 overs and they succumbed for 264.</p>\n<p>At least England are consistent. Their last three Test losses have been by 72, 71 and now 75 runs.</p>\n<p>There are major question-marks over Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell and whoever out of Ravi Bopara and Samit Patel is chosen as the sixth main batsman.</p>\n<p>Bell has 116 runs in those four Tests, Pietersen a top score of 32 and Strauss a long sequence of modest scores.</p>\n<p>Bopara's career has been bedevilled by inconsistency and self-doubt, while Patel scored two and nine on his debut.</p>\n<p>They may well gorge themselves this summer against West Indies and South Africa. But can England afford to take them to India next winter when the diet will again be non-stop spin?</p>\n<p>There are many who believe England's top six needs freshening up, with the introduction of a new face or two.</p>\n<p>That would certainly remove any comfort zone complacency.</p>\n<p>England have dropped one batsman this winter, with Eoin Morgan discarded from the present tour. But instead of elevating a bright young thing, England chose Bopara and Patel  two players who have been on the international scene for several years.</p>\n<p>Strauss said: \"I don't think you need to be a rocket scientist to work out where things have gone wrong this winter \"We haven't put scores on the board and you won't win many Test matches that way.</p>\n<p>\"I thought we showed in the second innings here that we have a lot of technical skill against spin bowling.
