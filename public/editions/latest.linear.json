Chancellor George Osborne also revealed that three Tory donors visited his residence at Dorneywood, Bucks. </p>\n<p>\nThey were Lord Feldman, Lord Wolfson and Howard Leigh. All are long-standing friends and visited in a personal capacity. </p>\n<p>\nOnly 24 hours earlier, No 10 had insisted the public had <b>NO</b> right to know who the Premier invited to his flat because it was private. </p>\n<p>\nBut by 6pm yesterday, the Tories had listed every private lunch or dinner the PM had with donors who gave over &#163;50,000. The occasions include: </p>\n<p>\nA \"thank you\" dinner in the state rooms of No 10 for party donors after the General Election win in July 2010. </p>\n<p>\nThree private dinners with him and wife Samantha in his No 10 flat between February 2011 and February 2012. </p>\n<p>\nThree lunches at Chequers over the last two years. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn a bid to put the scandal behind him, Mr Cameron again called the Cruddas bragging \"completely unacceptable\". The PM insisted: \"None of these dinners were fundraising dinners and none were paid for by the taxpayer. I have known most of those attending for many years. Peter Cruddas has never recommended anyone to come to dinner in the flat.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Cameron also promised that from now the Tories will publish details of meals attended by donors in Downing Street and Chequers. </p>\n<p>\nThe PM also urged Labour leader Ed Miliband to agree a cap on individual political donations of &#163;50,000. He said: \"We could take the big money out of politics, once and for all.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn another U-turn, the Tories appointed lawyer and Tory peer Lord Gold to lead an internal party inquiry. The PM's initial choice, Tory chairman and close pal Lord Feldman, was met with howls of derision. </p>\n<p>\nLabour insisted nothing short of a full independent inquiry would do. </p>\n<p>\nDespite denials that donors influenced policy, it emerged yesterday that a big giver wrote a major policy document at No 10's request. Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, who gave &#163;593,000 to the party, drew up plans to remove some workers' rights. </p>\n<p>\nAsked whether PM will entertain donors in his private flat in future, a close aide said: \"I suspect that there won't be that many. But there's nothing wrong with the PM meeting people who have donated to the party.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn another hurried move, the Government tried to restart stalled cross-party talks on party funding. </p>\n<p>\nTory MP Matthew Hancock last night asked ex-PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to reveal Labour donors who dined at No 10 and Chequers. </p>\n<p align=\"right\">\nt.newtondunn@the-sun.co.uk </a>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"left\">\nPaul Walsh <br></br>\n</h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\nTHE Chief Executive of drinks giant Diageo donated at least &#163;10,000 to the Tory Party.

I've had my feet in a bucket of ice every day for weeks to take the pain down. </p>\n<p>\n\"I can't lift my right arm properly so I'm going for an MRI scan on Tuesday. I think it's to do with my rotator cuff. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then when I have the MRI scan on my shoulder, I need to have one on my knee too because when I dropped Nina out of the headbanger in training, I landed on my knee and I've ripped all the bits in the back of it. </p>\n<p>\n\"My back and wrist hurts from the lifts and I've done my groin in. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I've got a week off the ice to let everything relax, then the tour starts. But I've no time off work.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nMatthew trained to be a gymnast from the age of four but had to quit the British team after breaking his back in a fall from the rings aged 17. Due to the stress of training, his old spinal injury flared up again. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It's definitely affected me on Dancing On Ice. I've had back problems since week two when I trapped a nerve.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPartner Nina added: \"He'll never admit it but he is in a lot of pain.\" The injury to his shoulder is so bad that Matthew thinks he would have <b>LOST</b> if the competition had gone on for another week. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nOn Sunday night's show the judges could see him struggling to get Nina above his head and Matthew said: \"Midway through the competition those lifts were popping up dead easily and yesterday it was really hard. </p>\n<p>\n\"I don't think I'd have coped with the lifts if we'd had one more week to go. If the final had been next week then I think we'd have had to take all the lifts out.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNina also got a share of injuries throughout the series. Not only did Matthew repeatedly drop her as he practised his lifts, he also slashed her leg open with the toe picks on his boots, leaving her with a huge scar. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"We put in blood, sweat and tears  lots of blood.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMatthew and Hollyoaks star Jorgie had to pull off three routines in the final  a showcase dance, their favourite routine from the series and their version of Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean's Bolero dance. Show judges and Olympians Katarina Witt and Robin Cousins said Matthew could have been an international ice skating champ if he had started at a young age. </p>\n<p>\nNow he is hoping to get his toddler son Buster  whose mum is Matthew's co-star fianc&#233;e Charley Webb  to try ice skating. </p>\n<p>\nMatthew said: \"Our northern coach, Stephen Pickavance, told me, 'You should have done this as a kid, you'd have gone so far.'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm definitely going to get Buster on the ice now this has all finished because it's brilliant and he'll love it. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now I can whizz him around and I feel confident enough. It will be great.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nMatthew thought he would never win a sporting trophy again after his gymnastic career was over, but winning Dancing On Ice is a great consolation prize. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It was amazing to win in an Olympic year. This makes up for the gymnastics a little bit. Training was my life until I had my accident and broke my back.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Matthew has been a huge hit with fans on Dancing On Ice but he insists he will never quit his soap role.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I don't want to leave Emmerdale. It's my bread and butter and they've been so accommodating throughout this whole show. </p>\n<p>\n\"Everyone at Emmerdale is just brilliant. I've signed a contract that takes me to Christmas then, hopefully, I'll get a new one after that too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nMatthew revealed he has a huge storyline coming up  and hinted that David's ex-girlfriend Leyla Harding (Rokhsaneh Ghawam-Shahidi) could be returning to cause trouble for him. </p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"I've got a big new storyline. It's to do with Alicia and David and the little one, Jacob. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Maybe Leyla might mess things up and come back  but I can't tell you if she will or not!\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>The Dancing On Ice UK tour runs from April 13 to May 7.

The passengers were collapsing all over the deck and being sick but I wasn't. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then the captain made the announcement, 'Do not worry. There hasn't been a tragedy at sea since the Titanic went down in 1912'. </p>\n<p>\n\"It wasn't true, of course, or heartening for us passengers. But yet again, the spectre of the Titanic had been raised.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin, his brothers and their parents were almost killed at sea themselves when, in 1967 on the way back from Australia, their ship travelled through the Suez Canal. </p>\n<p>\nHe recalls: \"A civil war was going on in Aden and our boat was fired upon. We were all ordered off the deck and into our cabins. It was quite exciting at the time but we could have all been killed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThat same year Robin narrowly missed losing his life again, when he and his then wife-to-be, Molly, were involved in the Hither Green rail disaster, in south London, in which 49 people died. He says: \"I felt on top of the world that morning as the Bee Gees had just had a big hit with Massachusetts. Looking back, Massachusetts probably saved my life. </p>\n<p>\n\"Until that record hit the Top Ten I would never have been able to afford a First Class train ticket. But on that occasion, because Massachusetts was doing so well, I did. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And like everyone else travelling First Class that day, both Molly and I had more chance of surviving the crash than those who weren't. </p>\n<p>\n\"But though we did survive, I saw harrowing things I've never forgotten. </p>\n<p>\n\"Headless bodies being dragged out of the train wreck, people screaming. </p>\n<p>\n\"Molly and I were rushed to hospital in Lewisham so we could be examined for injuries. I had broken glass from the train windows tangled in my hair. </p>\n<p>\n\"It took days to remove it but that was really the least of it. The shock and the horror was far, far worse. When we got to the hospital it looked like a war zone. All around us people were being carried in on stretchers and some of their injuries were horrific. Suddenly, it all became too much for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"The worst thing of all was that I was unable to help anyone, to mitigate their suffering, I couldn't cope with that. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I knew I had to get away from all the carnage so I checked out of the hospital and instead went to stay with the Bee Gees' manager, Robert Stigwood. </p>\n<p>\n<b>\"After that I suffered a delayed reaction. For days and days I couldn't stop crying. In the end the only thing which saved me was my music, composing with my brothers and singing again.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But although I did recover, I'll never really forget the horror of the Hither Green train crash and the tragedy of all those poor souls who died or were injured in it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin makes it clear that he does not think living through the rail disaster qualifies him for understanding the Titanic tragedy more than others. However, he believes it is easier for him to walk in the shoes of the doomed Titanic passengers. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs an avid collector of Titanic memorabilia, he has always been obsessed by the tragedy. </p>\n<p>\nHis collection includes a pen fashioned from pieces of the wreckage. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a present from second wife Dwina, who also gave one to RJ. </p>\n<p>\nAnd that led him to change tack from composing pop music and, with RJ  also a talented musician  embark on composing his first classical work. </p>\n<p>\nRobin adds: \"It has taken us two years to complete The Titanic Requiem. </p>\n<p>\n\"Two years of dedication, and I'm definitely very proud of it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRJ is also proud of the composition, and equally proud of his father's courage in working day and night on it while undergoing chemotherapy to combat his cancer. </p>\n<p>\nRJ says: \"He kept going on against all odds. He has been every inch a professional and he deserves a medal for it. For him to come straight out of chemotherapy and into the studio is incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"We've always been close but working on a piece of music that is meant to last for hundreds of years brought us even closer. </p>\n<p>\n<b>\"We composed the requiem in order to honour the memory of those who died and to celebrate the age in which they lived.\"</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nRobin adds: \"I never pushed RJ to become a musician, though. I wanted him to excel at whatever he wanted to do but I never pressured him. </p>\n<p>\n\"As he grew older it turned out that he had a flare for melody, and like me and my brothers, who never had music lessons, he flourished. Our collaboration has been wonderful. We have already started working on our next joint classical composition, The First World War Requiem. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But neither of us will be giving up pop music, either. RJ will be recording an album, Instant Love, and I will be working with Barry again, I'm looking forward to it. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"I just hope that The Titanic Requiem will be a fitting memorial for all those brave souls who died during the tragedy, so they will never be forgotten.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the most moving elements in the requiem is the song Don't Cry Alone, which Robin sings. It tells of a man who knows he is going to die begging his wife not to cry alone when he's gone. </p>\n<p>\nIt is a song that Dwina finds particularly emotional. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"When Robin first played me the song he was in the middle of chemotherapy. I cried when I heard it. It brought up all my fears that I might lose him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Robin jokes: \"I was afraid that I might lose me, too. Luckily, I was wrong... \"</i>\n</p>\n<li></li>\n<p>\n<b>The Titanic Requiem is released as an album tomorrow and will be performed in concert at Central Hall in London's Westminster on April 11.

It's incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n\"<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I'd try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n\"For breakfast, I'd have four slices of toast. For lunch I'd make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n\"Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I'd never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n\"Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: \"I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn't dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n\"So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges  you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n\"Worth more than &#163;3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class  purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n\"So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I'd done. It was the motivation I needed to carry on,\" she says. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Comparing myself month by month stunned me. My face was thinner and I could notice the difference in my waistline and arms.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I began looking forward to each month when the time came to take a picture and compare myself to the previous one.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola also joined a gym and began working out twice a week. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"After the first year I'd lost five stone  down from 24st to 19st. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My meals changed completely to consist of a piece of toast for breakfast, a sandwich with two pieces of brown bread for lunch, fruit for a snack and meat with vegetables for dinner. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking at myself filled me with pride and the compliments I was receiving from friends and family were incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was determined this wasn't going to just be a fad diet phase  this was a new lifestyle for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the next three years she lost a further six stone, dropping to 13st 2lb. </p>\n<p>\nNicola says: \"Every woman wants to look their best in a photo. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I was ever tempted to have a take-away binge at the end of the month, I'd think about having my picture taken and it would put me off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd for shoe-mad Nicola there was only one way to mark her sensational new figure. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In January this year I splashed out on a beautiful pair of &#163;380 cream Jimmy Choo shoes to celebrate.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4210484/Ive-tried-61-different-diets-since-I-was-13.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Why we're all tee totally happy"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4201637/My-8-year-takeaway-binge-cost-25kand-my-unborn-babys-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My 8-year takeaway binge cost £25k...and my unborn baby's life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I'm proud to be UK average size 16.

Of course popular music is, ideally, a young person's racket. </p>\n<p>\nIf all pop stars of both sexes retired from the stage when they were young and fresh, fine. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTake TV. Where's the logic in letting men go on until they look like resentful Galapagos tortoises while women are shoved off screen as soon as they can hold a pencil under their breasts? </p>\n<p>\nWomen are more than half the population and their eye candy requirements should be catered to. </p>\n<p>\nNo one says that George Michael, Madonna's contemporary, should throw in the men-only sauna towel. </p>\n<p>\nAnother of her generation, Michael Jackson, was indulged when it came to the ageing process, still playing the Peter Pan card when he frankly looked more like Baby Jane. </p>\n<p>\nMick Jagger is a decade and a half older than Madonna, yet is still the shrivelled subject of such ludicrous tributes as Moves Like Jagger. </p>\n<p>\nThe writer Truman Capote called him \"about as sexy as a p***ing toad\"  and now he looks as if a bored giant practised origami on his face for a very long time before throwing the mangled plaything aside. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Clive Dunn crooned Grandad on Top Of The Pops in the Seventies, he spent hours in make-up to look the part. </p>\n<p>\nBut Jagger, McCartney, Tom Jones  the prancing grandads are for real now. So why the vapours over Madonna in her shorts when she still has the body of a woman half her age? </p>\n<p>\nIf women are past it at 50, think about men and the way their bodies specifically become unappetising. Most of them are more Wayne Rooney than George Clooney to start with and time is rarely kind. </p>\n<p>\nWhat's sauce for the goose is good for the gander  and next to a pair of knee-length, wizened testicles (yes, I <b>KNOW</b> we can't see them, but we all <b>KNOW</b> they're there) what's a bit of turkey neck? </p>\n<p>\n<i>Go, Madge!

I was so bored. </p>\n<p>\nI was a California girl to a T, being brought up in Midway City between Los Angeles and San Diego. </p>\n<p>\nI was not a good girl and always in trouble for something or other. </p>\n<p>\nLooking back, I wish I had paid more attention  and I also regret that I did not have teachers who were more interested in me. </p>\n<p>\nWhen I became a mother, I realised I had not taken enough advantage of my education and came to appreciate how important it really is. </p>\n<p>\nThat is completely different to having success. </p>\n<p>\nThere are people who have had no education who have made a lot of their lives. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are not careful, education can just slip by and it is sometimes hard to get a second chance. </p>\n<p>\nI'd also taken up acting at school because I was so bad at English and thought I would improve by taking theatre studies. But becoming an actress was as unobtainable as going to the moon  or becoming president. </p>\n<p>\nI had worked, part-time, as a check-out girl in a supermarket since the age of 14 and, in the end, I left school at 17 and worked there full-time. I had not learned a thing. </p>\n<p>\nI was living with my parents at home, working the check-out, spending time on the beach and realised I'd better do something with my life. I called a friend of mine, Walter Deadman, who was a hairdresser, who had always been harping on at me to model. </p>\n<p>\nI told him I would like to become an actress. </p>\n<p>\nInstead of laughing, he suggested I join a beauty pageant. I called up a modelling agent, John Robert Powers, who ran a sort of charm school. </p>\n<p>\nI borrowed a dress  I never wore them because they used to call me chicken legs at high school  and went along for some test shots. I used those to put myself up for the pageant. </p>\n<p>\nSo I went to LA for the first time in my life for the pageant. The biggest stress was that I smoked and I'd have to give it up for a week! I won a prize, because they suddenly decided they wanted a Miss Orange County. In truth, they had more crowns than people. </p>\n<p>\nBut winning that pageant did change my life. I moved out of my parents' house to about half a mile down the road and about six months later signed with an agent. </p>\n<p>\nI got a TV series and did not have to work at the supermarket any more. After that, what happened to me felt very dreamlike  a Disneyland experience, which changed me. </p>\n<p>\nBut I also wish I'd have known how being recognised would bother me far more than it should. </p>\n<p>\nI found it disturbing and completely unnatural. There is nothing to prepare you. </p>\n<p>\nI wish I could have handled it better, initially. </p>\n<p>\nI have learned since that it is possible to have both a home life and a working life. The worst moment was when there was a radio report, in the late 1990s, that David had left me for Ally McBeal actress Calista Flockhart  and we were both listening in the car, with the kids! </p>\n<p>\nThey gave an on-air apology the next day and I have never heard a more grovelling retraction. But it is hard dealing with that kind of stuff. </p>\n<p>\nI also struggled with my own image as a sexual person. </p>\n<p>\nThat ended with a film, The Fabulous Baker Boys in 1989, by which time I was 31. </p>\n<p>\nEven two years before that, I would not have been able to play the part of the sexually appealing Susie Diamond. She was dynamic and unapologetic and I was able to put on those clothes and play the part. I think, because of the way I looked, I had stayed away from buying anything sexy or overtly sexual. </p>\n<p>\nIt was a turning point for me, because I could understand why men would find her sexy. </p>\n<p>\nI wish I'd been more like her. Before that, I would walk around looking like a bag lady! </p>\n<p>\nBut the biggest turning point in my life was becoming a mother. If you had told me when I was 18 that I could survive on three hours' sleep a night, I'd have never believed it. You just cope. </p>\n<p>\nI would not choose a showbusiness career for my children. </p>\n<p>\nI would say: 'Be a doctor, or something else'. The value of a good education has never left me.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4198283/Johnny-Depp-news-Actor-plays-vampire-in-new-Tim-Burton-film-Dark-Shadows.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Darkest Depps"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4126962/Bryan-Adams-Valentines-Day-mash-up.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Bryan Adams Valentine's Day mash-up"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4076093/Johnny-Depp-news-Actor-sports-another-pale-face-in-Tim-Burton-movie-Dark-Shadows.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Johnny looks Deppart"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4059894/Johnny-Depp-news-Stars-face-changed-for-Tim-Burton-vampire-movie-Dark-Shadows-with-Michell-Pfeiffer.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Johnny is Depp in the Dark Shadows"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNF26MICH--532o_1477786a.jpg","caption":"Regrets ...

Damn, I'll just dye my hair'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe actress had to endure months of gruelling training to get in shape for the role. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It was intense. I had training about three times a day for a few months. Then, once we started working, I had to have the training just for endurance because it was so many hours. </p>\n<p>\n\"I mean, if there's a scene of me running up a mountain, that's what we shot all day  me running up a mountain. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had about six weeks of archery. It was brand new to me and I loved it. I think I'm good at shooting arrows now  and I can skin a squirrel!\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe action was so intense that the star, who is dating British actor Nicholas Hoult, 22, had a constant battle to keep weight on. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It was great to lose weight because it was unintentional. I didn't go to the gym once. It was just a really physical movie. </p>\n<p>\n\"I actually ate more on that movie than I ever have on any other because it was non-stop and physical and I needed energy. </p>\n<p>\n\"It happened very naturally with all the training. It was hard to keep weight on for continuity. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I ate a ton. Any picture you see of me from that set, I'm probably eating.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer jumped at the chance to play the lead role. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I loved the books. That was the hardest part for me. </p>\n<p>\n\"I almost wished I didn't love them as much as I did because of just the pressure I put on myself to make sure it was something I could be happy about and proud of. </p>\n<p>\n\"Katniss is such an iconic character and there is so much pressure just coming from myself because I was a fan.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe movie, based on Suzanne Collins' novels, is set in a future North America destroyed by drought, fire, famine and war. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEach year inhabitants are forced to take part in a televised fight to the death. </p>\n<p>\nJennifer said: \"I think it makes us look at humanity in kind of a real way, where it is is becoming desensitised. </p>\n<p>\n\"We can watch the demise of a marriage or we can watch death on television and it's entertainment. </p>\n<p>\n\"We're a society that's obsessed with reality. We're obsessed with gossip and bad things happening rather than good stories and good, uplifting things. We live in a world where history repeats itself and it's <i>(the events of the movie)</i> really not that far off, I don't think.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer is quickly rising up the ranks in Hollywood thanks to the new movie on top of past success. She was nominated for an Oscar last year for her role in thriller Winter's Bone  but she says she does not feel like a star. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The glamorous part lasts for about five minutes and it doesn't even really feel glamorous. So it just feels like a job. Being on a set is not glamorous. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I don't really think about it because I don't really like going out that much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm kind of a home body, so I was stressing out one time about movies and that I won't be able to go out to dinner  I won't be able to go to a bar and just hang out. </p>\n<p>\n\"But then I'm always lying to get out of those things anyway. So now I just have an excuse  'I can't go, I'm famous'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I guess I feel I have to be more mature. I can't really, like, moon the paparazzi or anything, which is always my dream.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer, who auditioned for the part of Bella in Twilight, was also in X-Men: First Class last year. But she doesn't want to fall into Hollywood's traps. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"It is so strange to see in Hollywood how skinny these women are and how that puts pressure on our young girls. </p>\n<p>\n\"I remember being in school when I was 14 and girls were on diets and eating salads with dressing on the side. It was just weird. </p>\n<p>\n\"It's not healthy because I don't really think that's beautiful. Every time somebody talks about skinny, nobody ever writes how great it is to be skinny and how everyone loves someone who is skinny.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"They're always writing about when this fad is going to end. I can't wait for it to end.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJennifer plays a former sex addict in forthcoming movie The Silver Linings Playbook, which also stars legend Robert De Niro. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Fantastic  Robert De Niro. I can't believe I can even talk to him really but he's just so down-to-earth and nice and normal.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd although she is now dating Nicholas she admits there is another British actor she has the hots for  Clive Owen. </p>\n<p>\n<i>After The Hunger Games, most red-blooded men will have the hots for Jennifer too. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nHunger Games facts </h1>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>THE Hunger Games trilogy of novels has been translated into 26 languages and is on sale in 38 countries. </b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\nA whopping ten million copies of the books were sold last year alone. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<b>Writer Suzanne Collins, 50, whose first Hunger Games book came out in 2008, is now Amazon Kindle's best-selling author.

All of a sudden I could see myself in a gorgeous white dress, walking down the aisle with all my friends and family looking on proudly. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In that moment I decided I had to get married and started planning straight away. I wanted to put my name on the wedding waiting list there and then.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin minutes of returning home, Rearna decided both her dad Des, 54, and brother Landon, 19, would walk her down the aisle to the song A Case Of You by James Blake. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"It's such a beautiful song, when I heard it on the radio I instantly said 'That's it'.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEver since her visit to the church ten months ago, Rearna is \"like a woman possessed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite her friends mocking her sudden obsession with her fantasy wedding, Rearna hasn't stopped giving them details of her big day. </p>\n<p>\nShe admitted: \"My friends laugh at me. They couldn't understand when I first told them I'd started to plan a wedding without a boyfriend. </p>\n<p>\n\"Suddenly, bridal shops and wedding magazines became interesting. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking through them for ideas, my mind raced with thoughts of invites, flowers and, of course, the dress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna was in Uckfield, East Sussex, for a day when she saw an ivory dress on a mannequin in the window of Fross Wedding Collections. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I stopped in my tracks. I'd seen dresses I liked in the magazines but nothing compared to this. </p>\n<p>\n\"I knew straight away it was the dress I was going to get married in and booked an appointment for later that day to try it on. </p>\n<p>\n\"My friend Leah Butson  she's a student too  and I both had tears in our eyes as I twirled in front of the mirror with the circular train trailing behind me. It was the stuff of dreams.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nReturning home that night, unable to stop thinking about her dream dress, Rearna began to panic that the dress would sell out before she had the funds to buy it. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I just know how upset I'll be if I finally saved up the money only to find out it's gone. The only way is to put down a deposit of &#163;150, so I'm going to have to save so I can be safe in the knowledge it's mine. </p><p>\n\"I go in to try it on at least once a month and because I've been doing it for the past seven months shop owner knows me by name. </p>\n<p>\n\"I've even considered taking out a loan to cover the &#163;1,100 to put my mind at rest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna now visits the church every month to visualise her big day and measure up to work out how many flowers she will need. </p>\n<p>\nShe explained: \"I sit and picture how it will look. I've planned to have the whole interior lit up with a thousand tea light candles and the pews to be draped with off-white silk. I love animals, so I've asked my best friend if her dogs can be involved. They're going to be dressed in little suits and dresses and will accompany the bridesmaids down the aisle. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My friend Kirsty Naunton makes amazing cakes so I instantly got her on the phone to discuss what I wanted. </p>\n<p>\n\"The chosen cake is three tiers with white icing and diamante-style decorations.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make sure her dream wedding will not become a distant fantasy, Rearna has made a pact with a close friend, 23-year-old Jonny Gregson, that if neither is married by the age of 30, they'll tie the knot. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Age 28 is my goal so I have a few years to find someone, finalise my plans and save the &#163;30,000 I need.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough she's missing a groom, Rearna couldn't wait to break the news to those who make up the rest of the bridal party. </p>\n<p>\nBest friends Olivia Jones, 21, Leah, 22, Kirsty Naunton, 22, and Lil Griffin, 21, will all be bridesmaids. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Although they think I'm mad, they're all excited. </p>\n<p>\n\"I have already taken them to the shop to show them the pink dresses they'll be wearing.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWith the ceremony planned in fine detail, Rearna will be taking her guests to the nearby beach for the reception in a giant marquee. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"Living in Brighton, I've decided to have a party on the beach. </p>\n<p>\n\"Watching the sun set with my family and friends and new husband will be so amazing.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe single bride-to-be does not want to leave any part unplanned so Rearna has recently finalised her food menu. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"My grandma Daisy Ackord is Jamaican and she makes the best food I've ever tasted, so she's in charge of catering for my big day. I'm going to have a West Indian menu consisting of jerk chicken, specialty rice and peas, ackee and saltfish and special Jamaican cakes for dessert.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRearna and her gran have worked out the Caribbean feast will cost &#163;50 a head. And for the music, she will hire a jazz-funk band. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I come from a very musical family and we're all big jazz fans so I've been keeping an eye out for one that can cater for weddings.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery time someone mentions getting married, Rearna always tries to slip in a mention of St Bartholomew's. </p>\n<p>\nThe singleton even spoke to someone who had been married at the venue. When they revealed they had trouble with parking she immediately factored in plans to have minibuses bring guests to the venue. </p>\n<p>\nDespite living on her student loan, Rearna is already trying to save the &#163;30,000 she's worked out she needs for her big day. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"The first thing I'm going to spend my first proper pay cheque on is my wedding dress. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm completely obsessed with it and can't wait to have it hung in my wardrobe instead of in a shop window.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBut Rearna is under no illusions  she knows the detail with which she has planned her big day could send a new boyfriend running a mile. </p>\n<p>\n<i>She said: \"When I do meet someone I'll be keeping these plans firmly under wraps  until I have a ring on my finger...\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4212557/I-halted-my-wedding-to-save-my-pet-lizard-from-cancer.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I halted my wedding to save pet lizard George"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/3716221/I-picked-the-reception-flowers-and-fiances-wedding-dress.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3784586/Dumped-on-my-wedding-day.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Dumped on my wedding day"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4185938/Big-Fat-Gypsy-Weddings-Cheyenne-shares-her-big-day-with-The-Sun.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"4 hairdressers, 10 bridesmaids and 1 smashed-up Rolls...inside the craziest gypsy wedding yet"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4166718/Wondering-how-our-leap-year-proposal-girls-got-on.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Wondering how our leap year proposal girls got on?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4184141/Big-Fat-Gypsy-Weddings-Gypsy-bride-Cheyennes-one-fingered-gesture-at-wedding.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"No, love ... ring goes on the other finger"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4127602/I-cant-wait-to-be-a-bridesmaid-at-gay-exs-wedding.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/3918082/I-struggled-to-get-down-on-one-knee-but-Sophies-worth-it.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I struggled to get down on one knee  but Sophie's worth it"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01477/SNF25WOMW-532_1477091a.jpg","caption":"Get me to the church ...

We saw his horrifically burned body and we cannot get that image out of our minds.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nMedical student Mundill Mahil, 20, was jailed last month for six years for GBH with intent. Harvinder Shoker, also 20, got life for murder, while 20-year-old Darren Peters was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. </p>\n<p>\nNow, Amandip and her mum Tajinder have asked the Attorney General to review the sentence handed to Mahil and set up an e-petition, Justice For Gagandip. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking out for the first time, Amandip added: \"He would not have been murdered if Mundill Mahil hadn't lured him to her flat in Brighton in a carefully orchestrated honeytrap. </p>\n<p>\n\"Mahil will be released for good behaviour in three years. It's outrageous. Other cases involving money and fraud get much more punishment. Gagandip's life has been taken. I believe something more needs to be done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip's body was found in the burning car in Blackheath, south-east London, in February last year. </p>\n<p>\nHe had been violently attacked in Brighton before being driven back to the capital and murdered. </p>\n<p>\n<i>A post-mortem examination revealed he was still alive when the fire in the car was started.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the second tragedy for the family in just 18 months. In September 2009 Gagandip's father Charanjit was murdered in India. Eight people are on trial there accused of being involved. </p>\n<p>\nGagandip took over his dad's packaging firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"We were only just starting to come to terms with the first murder when Gagan was killed. It has knocked the life out of me and Mum.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court heard that Mahil, from Chatham, Kent, had been Gagandip's girlfriend. He was in love but they split up in August 2010 after she alleged he had sexually assaulted her. </p>\n<p>\nShoker, his friend of five years, also fell in love with Mahil and decided to take revenge on the businessman. </p>\n<p>\nIn February last year she lured Gagandip to her house in Brighton. </p>\n<p>\nShe knew that Shoker and Peters, both from London, would be lying in wait for him. </p>\n<p>\nHe was beaten unconscious and bundled into the boot of the car. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"I only met Mahil once, when Gagandip brought her to our home. She was very pretty and confident and seemed a nice person. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My brother and I were very close and were both living at home and saw each other every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"He became very close to her and said she was a friend he trusted and who he could talk to about anything. </p>\n<p>\n\"Look at how she betrayed his trust. She tried to destroy my brother's character in court. </p>\n<p>\n\"But he was a kind, generous man who would have done anything to help anyone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDetective Superintendent Damian Allain, who investigated the case, said after the conviction: \"Throughout the investigation and trial Mahil portrayed herself as a victim. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is clear to me, now endorsed by the jury's verdict, that her actions were calculating and that she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy with Shoker and Peters of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which resulted in his death.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family say Gagandip had the world at his feet. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"He ran the family's successful employment agency and packaging business. He also set up and headed Sikh TV. </p>\n<p>\n\"In addition, he was the founder of the British Sikh Student Federation. He had made friends and contacts all around the world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHis mother Tajinder, 45, was equally proud of his achievements. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"He had done so much. I didn't think a 21-year-old would be capable of so much. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'm amazed how much he achieved. Never a day goes by when we don't think about him. </p>\n<p>\n\"I am devastated by my son's killing and struggling to cope. In my life there's only a dead end. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There's nothing left ahead. The whole story has finished here.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe now runs the family business, which employs 300 people. But with the emotional turmoil of losing her son she found it almost impossible to carry on with it. </p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"When I first learned of Gagandip's death I was completely and utterly broken. </p>\n<p>\n\"I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on. I do not have the support of a husband because he also died not so long before Gagan. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I cannot describe on an average day my life since Gagandip's death because they have all blended into one. </p>\n<p>\n\"In the early stages I couldn't hold a conversation without breaking down in tears and there were occasions when the police had to call an ambulance for me after I collapsed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCherished pictures from the family photo album show what a loving son and brother Gagandip was. </p>\n<p>\nThere was also a picture of him at his 21st birthday party with killer Shoker. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Shoker turned up uninvited to the party. </p>\n<p>\n\"We knew things weren't right between Gagandip and Shoker by that stage. The photo of them together is so ironic as they look like the best of friends  and for over five years they were. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I'm sickened by the thought that the man who holds his hand lovingly over my brother's heart in the photo is the same person who later beat him so terribly then burned him alive. </p>\n<p>\n\"He spent so much time around at our house that he practically lived here. </p>\n<p>\n\"What he did is such a terrible betrayal of trust.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGagandip was cremated and his ashes scattered in a river at the Kiratpur Sahib temple in the Punjab, India. </p>\n<p>\nLike her mother, Amandip broke down when she remembered the precious times they had together. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe said: \"I found it hard to go into his bedroom without getting very upset.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, though, they remember him with the shrine in the garden and in his former bedroom in south east London. </p>\n<p>\nAmandip said: \"Mum and I actually slept in his room as a way of trying to feel closer to him. </p>\n<p>\n\"Now we have turned his bedroom into a shrine, with a large photo of him on the bed and all his clothes and possessions are still in the room.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Gagandip's mum and sister are still clearly in pain over his loss  but their grief would be easier to bear if they felt justice had been done.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional reporting: MARK CHRISTY</b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3982615/Revenge-killing-of-TV-boss.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'Revenge killing' of TV boss"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3683937/Grieving-mum-in-battle-with-Turkish-cops.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Our son was drugged and murdered for £150 a few hours after this holiday snap... now we want justice"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF24hon5n---532_1476721a.jpg","caption":"Honeytrapper ...

I wasn't sure about doing it this time, but Oz urged me to and I agreed. </p>\n<p>\n\"I had done them since I was young and I seemed to be gifted. The card he chose to show the future was the Burning Tower. I did them again, this time for career, Oz chose the Burning Tower again. The worst card there is. </p>\n<p>\n\"It signifies death and endings, the worst outcome imaginable and entirely unavoidable. Everything you know gone in ruin or catastrophe. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOz looked stricken. He said, 'I feel this is going to be a really bad year for me. I've got this feeling as if everything is slipping'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I tried to lighten it, saying, 'You'll probably just stub your toe when you're at work  you're always a screamer with loads of bad luck! Don't worry, it might just mean that you won't get a promotion or something'. </p>\n<p>\n\"'No', he said. 'It's not the card. That just confirmed what I already know and feel'. </p>\n<p>\n\"When it was my turn to choose a card I hoped I might get something that would lift the mood, but I was startled when I got it in my spread of cards, too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"But then I got rebirth after, and the moon. 'See, hun  always light in the dark. Remember that', he said. I tried to hide my dismay. 'It's a dark time of year. Perhaps we're both just feeling it', I said. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Let's be positive, forget the cards, we've got lots to look forward to', I chirped, waiting for him to follow my lead. </p>\n<p>\n\"He usually did, but this time Oz said, 'No, it's bad. I've got this feeling that if I go out after January or February, I'm not coming back. That's what my gut is telling me'. There was nothing I could say that would cheer him and the truth was it was hard even to try, because I felt worried too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Despite the omen, devoted Christina put aside her foreboding when Oz was sent to the front.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring his dangerous deployment she would make a wish for his protection during the full moon. </p>\n<p>\nBut on the last full moon before Oz's return she inexplicably fell asleep with young son Laird and missed her routine. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I woke around 4am, disorientated. I was fully clothed and Laird was asleep on me, in his pyjamas. As the realisation dawned that I had missed doing the wish for Oz, the moon had disappeared and I felt distraught. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'Oh my God, what have I done?' I whispered. 'I've done it every month. Why now?'\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I told myself it didn't matter, that it was just a bit of silly tradition, that I should forget it. But I couldn't.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nChristina's foreboding grew to fever pitch shortly before Oz, who won a gallantry gong on his tour, was due home. </p>\n<p>\nThe spooky signs grew to the point where she says she <b>KNEW</b> he was dead even before the fateful news came with a knock on the door from two officers bringing confirmation. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"Two days before he was due to leave Afghanistan for home, Oz called again. I could hear immediately that he was low. </p>\n<p>\n\"He had been out of contact for several days and he sounded shattered. He said, 'Honey, I just feel really bad, I've got this odd feeling, like dread, I don't feel safe, it's bad. Have you got it too?' I had. In the pit of my stomach I felt a lurch as he spoke. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I had been uneasy, anxious, and had a feeling of dread, but I didn't want to say that. </p>\n<p>\n'You're tired,' I said. 'It's OK, you'll be back soon. Do what you did the last few months in the next couple of days, hun. You've got 48 hours left, that's all'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'Honey', he said, 'I'm mentally and spiritually hammered, I'm hanging out. I've been away too long, worked too much. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'And if it's too much for me it's too much for anyone. But I can't let it show. I've got to keep positive and strong, they <i>(the other men)</i> have to trust me. If anything happens to me, I don't want them to blame themselves. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish you could come and get me. I need you. Just come and get me now, honey'. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'I wish I could', I said, tears running down my face. 'But I can't. You've got to stop talking like this, you're just tired. You can push for 48 hours'. 'I need to speak to Laird,' he said. I handed Laird the phone and he went upstairs and they talked. </p>\n<p>\n\"When Laird gave the phone back, Oz said, 'I'm calm, honey, but I can't help how I feel. I don't think I'm coming back, 'cos I'm cuffing it now. I'm drained  it's hard to explain'. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next day I kept the phone beside me all evening, hoping he'd ring. I wanted to ring him but I couldn't, so that night I emailed  'Please email me, Don't go out on the ground tomorrow, cut the last day, don't do it.' He never got it.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThat night Christina had a visitation in her dreams from another hero bomb hunter, Warrant Officer Gary \"Gaz\" O'Donnell, who had perished in the Afghan badlands disarming a Taliban device. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes: \"I slept fitfully then I dreamed that Gaz O'Donnell was standing in front of me. 'Don't worry, Chris, I'm here to get him when he comes over,' he said. 'I'll hold him. I won't let go'. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\" 'What are you on about?' I said. 'You've got no arms'. Gaz just looked at me and smiled. </p>\n<p>\n\"The next morning, Saturday October 31, 2009, I woke at 6.30am with a feeling I'd never had before. It was as powerful as thunder. </p>\n<p>\n\" 'It's today', I thought. 'He's going or has he gone yet?' I felt it so surely that it was in the floor beneath my feet as I got out of bed and in the air around me as I went downstairs. </p>\n<p>\n\"I felt numb, suspended in time, as I went through the motions of life. At nine I phoned my mum and told her I wasn't going to take Laird to his swimming lesson that morning. 'What's going on?' she said. 'You sound so quiet. Oz is home tomorrow, you should be happy'. </p>\n<p>\n\"I paused. 'He's not coming home, Mum, I know it'. \"\n</p>\n<p>\nOz was killed, defusing a bomb, on Halloween while Christina was walking in the woods gathering her thoughts. </p>\n<p>\nAt the exact moment he died she wept uncontrollably. </p>\n<p>\nLater in her book Christina reveals more spiritual happenings. She tells how Oz's spirit communicated with her through the spiritualist mum of a friend. </p>\n<p>\nShe writes what the spiritualist said: \"He's saying, 'Coffee, white, one  man-up'. Oh, and what an awful taste, it's something like liquorice. What is that?' I smiled. 'His liquorice rollies, the menthol tips, he always smoked them. And that's how he talked'. She had his intonation exactly right. </p>\n<p>\n\"She always passes on an Oz message in his distinctive style. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"And it helps me to keep going and keeps me grounded.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>d.willetts@the-sun.co.uk</a></b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Always By My Side, by Christina Schmid, is published by Century, &#163;12.99. &#169; Christina Schmid 2012.

Sometimes they literally just faint. But occasionally, they have a cardiac arrest.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs one of a few doctors there when I joined the Lords 17 years ago, I was appalled how poor were the arrangements for these sudden, terrifying emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe attendant staff had often been trained in mouth-to-mouth and cardiac resuscitation, but there was no defibrillator anywhere in Parliament. This piece of kit is a life-saver.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen its electrodes are applied across the chest, its sudden pulse of high voltage electricity can jolt the heart back into a normal rhythmic beat. It's a clever device because its detector only allows an electric shock if the collapsed patient has had a cardiac arrest or a fatal change of heart rhythm.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo it is safe and exceptionally easy to use by any layman with minimal training.\n</p>\n<p>\nYet when I tried to persuade the authorities in Parliament to obtain one of these portable machines (they are not expensive) officials in both Houses refused. Their excuses were shameful.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne official argued that we could not have a defibrillator as it would cause a problem if a tourist collapsed in the gallery  should we be obliged to offer resuscitation to a member of the public? It was suggested there might be legal consequences if it were used or not used. Four years later, an elderly peer collapsed right after speaking. There were no doctors present in the chamber and he died.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly then, reluctantly, was a defibrillator installed, and since then at least two lives have been saved. Cardiac arrest is extremely common yet it can be correctable. Clearly, it would help if everybody were trained in external cardiac massage, for example in schools. This knowledge would save some lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut a clever defibrillator is a different matter. It is astonishing that so many public buildings do not have them readily available.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Those first few seconds after a cardiac emergency are critical and we must be prepared.\n</i></p>\n<p>\n<b>To sign The Sun-backed British Heart Foundation petition, click here</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4209790/Show-your-support-and-join-our-campaign-for-CPR-in-schools.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4210386/Medics-had-to-zap-Fabrice-Muamba-15-times.html?iPadApp=true"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4212641/Fabrice-Muambas-family-give-thanks-to-fans-as-star-recovers.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba's family give thanks to fans"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4207991/Fabrice-Muamba-was-dead-for-78-minutes.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba was 'dead' for 78 minutes"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4205926/Fabrice-Muamba-asks-Did-we-lose.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Fabrice Muamba asks: Did we lose?"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01476/SNF2428FX-532_1476788a.jpg","caption":"Race against time ... medics treat Muamba on the pitch and, inset, Lord Robert Winston"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01475/SNF22H02NFX_1475388a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Counting the calories ...

I'm a laid back and a down-to-earth girl and I love to have a laugh.\" Stephanie's boobs proved something of an overnight sensation when she was just 12. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"It was so weird. I was a total cheeseboard then one day I woke up with a C cup. It was really annoying because I loved PE and sport. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was really into hurdles and running but my boobs started to restrict me. And as I got bigger, it was harder to find a sports bra.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring one family holiday in America Stephanie and her mum Josie, 51, went in search of one that would fit. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"We tried this lingerie shop to get a measurement. I was 19 and about a 30J at that point. </p>\n<p>\n\"The staff couldn't believe it. Instead of measuring me they just kept calling more and more staff members out of the back to stare at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie adds: \"Finding a bikini is atrocious. Nothing fits me so I have to buy separates. \"I'll buy a size 12 for my lower half and a 20 for my top half  but even that's too small and they'll be spilling out all over the place. I also get serious back pain. </p>\n<p>\n\"Exercise is a nightmare. To do any exercise I have to wear a bra then a sports bra on top. </p>\n<p>\n\"I'll go to my local gym and I just get stared at. Gym clothes are quite tight so the guys will full-on stare.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie doesn't know how she got her huge boobs  though there is something in her family genes. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"My mum does have big boobs but she's probably more of a DD or an E. But my sister Morena has normal-sized breasts. </p>\n<p>\n\"Whenever I visit her she'll say, 'God, Stephanie, can you give me some of your boobs!'\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe adds: \"I think my dad and older brothers found it awkward when I blossomed. They didn't like men checking me out on the beach. We went on holiday to Italy last year. We went to a water park and I was getting a lot of male attention. Wives were whacking their husbands over the head for staring.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nStephanie works in her parents' fancy dress shop, where she is able to stitch her clothes to fit. She says: \"If I don't adjust tops they swamp me or I just look huge. So I've become quite the seamstress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for the future, Stephanie plans to start her own business and says: \"I know it sounds weird but I'd love to run my own corn on the cob stall. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I saw a stall selling sweetcorn when I was 15 and ever since, that's what I've wanted to do. You can have butter and pepper on it and things like that  it would be pretty cool.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd despite all the aggro she gets over her shape, on balance she wouldn't want to downsize. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"A part of me loves the attention. They're a great talking point and I get to meet a lot of people. But the downsides probably outweigh that one positive. </p>\n<p>\n\"And even the attention can be a double-edged sword. Some days I just don't want to be stared at.\"\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p>\n<b>By CAROL COOPER, Sun Doctor</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nABNORMALLY large breasts can cause a number of problems, mostly due to the sheer weight. They change the way a woman stands, increasing the curvature of the spine and putting extra strain on it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nThis makes back and neck pain common. It can be even worse if the woman has to lift anything heavy. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nShoulders can also suffer, with bra straps causing deep grooves from the weight they support. Nerve pain down the arm can occur, sometimes with tingling in the fingers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSweating under the breasts is inevitable, so dermatitis and infections are common, with ulceration in bad cases. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nExercise is tricky. Some women wear two bras at once but it is hard to stop breast discomfort. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAdverse comments can make the woman feel very ill at ease and some become stressed and even depressed. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>a.jones@the-sun.co.uk</a></b>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4127333/Model-with-38KKK-boobs-is-saved-by-airbags.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Model with 38KKK boobs is saved by airbags"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4192971/TOWIE-star-Lauren-Pope-I-just-wanted-my-ticking-timebomb-PIP-breast-implants-out.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"I was terrified my PIP implants were a ticking timebomb.

If it's to be 100 more games then that would be great.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nGiggs has played in 20 of United's 30 Premier League matches so far this season. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the influence he and Scholes have had on the team has been a key factor in United overhauling neighbours City at the top of the Premier League. </p>\n<p>\nBut Giggs maintains a punishing fitness regime is the main reason he is still able to keep pace with more youthful team-mates like Phil Jones and Danny Welbeck. </p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"Yoga has definitely helped me. It helps me with training because it gives me the flexibility and the strength to not only play games but train every day. </p>\n<p>\n\"I rarely miss a training session even if I do a little bit less than the younger players. </p>\n<p>\n\"You have to change your way of thinking.

You want to be in the team all the time. Then you want to score goals. </p>\n<p>\n\"Then you get really greedy  you want to win trophies and then you win more trophies. </p>\n<p>\n\"All these things have happened to me  I realised my dream and at 38 I'm still living my dream.

Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan Samaraweera led something of a recovery before the former also fell to Swann for 14. </p>\n<p>\nSamaraweera pushed the hosts towards a 200-run lead but missed another Swann twirler and was stumped by Prior for 36. </p>\n<p>\nDinesh Chandimal was 17 not out at stumps and with England's batting so fragile, Sri Lanka will be forgiven for thinking they have almost built a match-winning lead already. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4220791/James-Anderson-arrives-among-the-greats-by-breaking-250-wicket-mark.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Right Ander"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4220195/James-Anderson-hails-Mahela-Jayawardene-century.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jimmy full of praise for Jayawardene's century"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/4219833/Mahela-Jayawardene-century-lights-up-day-one-in-Galle.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jayawardene century lights up day one"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01478/SWANN1_1478906a.jpg","caption":"SWANN SONG ...
