Finally, he set both body and house alight. </p>\n<p>\nPolice and firemen arrived to find Bartlam and brother Dominic, six, standing outside. </p>\n<p>\nHe told officers he woke to find a masked intruder in the house. The man had hurled a hammer at him then fled. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBartlam said he then found his mumâs blood-covered body and realised the house was ablaze. </p>\n<p>\nHe claimed he grabbed his brother and their dog and fled. </p>\n<p>\nBut a search of Bartlamâs bedroom revealed a disturbing drawing of a woman who had two knives rammed into eyes â with the words: âDie bitch.â\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were also notebooks of ravings on sex abuse and death. </p>\n<p>\nAnd his computer had the violent clips from soap and films along with a record of his visits to murder websites. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nExperts also recovered the script he had deleted â a chillingly accurate account of the murder. It included a description of a hammer attack, a fake break-in alibi, a fire â and even the rescue of a younger brother. They also found cleaning fluid â suggesting an attempt to eliminate evidence. </p>\n<p>\nDuring initial interviews Bartlam stuck to his story. </p>\n<p>\nHe claimed he last saw his mum alive the night before her death when she left some clothes in his bedroom. </p>\n<p>\nBut a neighbour reported being woken at 1am by her and Bartlam arguing violently. </p>\n<p>\nBartlam finally blurted out the truth while on remand. After a row with a female resident at a care centre, he told an officer: âI could kill her, just like I killed my mum.â\n</p>\n<p>\nBartlam then changed his story. He admitted killing divorcee Jacqueline â but insisted it was manslaughter, not murder. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said he had gone berserk as they rowed about a pair of lost trainers. Bartlam claimed he struck out after she taunted him for being âa f****** freak.â He insisted he had been a victim of years of âinappropriate parentingâ. But at his trial the jury refused to believe his story and found him guilty of murder. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday Nottingham Crown Court judge Mr Justice Flaux sentenced Bartlam to life with a minimum of 16 years. </p>\n<p>\nHe said the public schoolboy carried out a âgrotesque and senseless killing.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring Bartlamâs trial the jury heard of his fascination with the Corrie character John Stape, who killed three people. One of Stapeâs victims was teacher Charlotte Hoyle â who he hit over the head with a hammer. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe court was also told that in 2010 Bartlam was referred to a school counsellor after behaving bizarrely in class. </p>\n<p>\nHe told the counsellor he heard voices urging him to hurt people who had upset him. Bartlam also told of visions of killing people with a knife. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBut six weeks before he murdered his mum, health assessors said he showed no sign of mental illness and was not a danger to others. After yesterdayâs verdict Detective Chief Inspector Kate Meynell said: âThe boy planned and carried out what he thought was the perfect murder. </p>\n<p>\nâMaybe one day he may explain what happened. The whole thing has been chilling. He spoke in court about what he did without any remorse.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nJacquelineâs parents said in a statement: âDaniel attempted to make out during the trial that Jacqui was a bad mother, which couldnât be further from the truth. She loved her boys. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâThere are no winners here because not only have we lost Jacqui, but we have lost Daniel too. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The most difficult part for us â and something that only Daniel can answer â is: Why?â\n</p>\n<p>\nITV yesterday said: âITV takes careful steps to ensure that pre-watershed drama is appropriate for a family audience and the Stape murder scenes in Coronation Street were fully compliant.â\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\"></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\na.parker@the-sun.co.uk</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<h1>\nmyView<br></br>\n</h1>\n<h6>\nBy Dr DAVID HOLMES, Criminal Psychologist </h6>\n<p>\nCHILDREN learn violence from TV but generally do not act on it. </p>\n<p>\nA small minority, however, do not have the same restraint that holds most of us back. </p>\n<p>\nIt can be caused by something missing in their biology or chemistry.

It answered his prayers for victory and means even more of a squeaky bum time for Manchester City rival Roberto Mancini. </p>\n<p>\nDelighted Fergie said: âThe goals came so late, which typifies the clubâs history. </p>\n<p>\n\"Coming when it did, the Antonio Valencia goal was very important. </p>\n<p>\n\"If you donât try to shoot youâll never find out if you can score.

We are also helped by having made up the goals deficit on City. I think it was 18 at one time.â\n</p>\n<p>\nYoung, who scored from 20 yards with five minutes to go, said: âTo get that first goal, whether it was a shot or a cross, delighted us and Iâd put my goal up there with my best.â\n</p>\n<p>\nSteve Keanâs Rovers fought a battling rearguard action but finally bowed to the pressure they were put under and fall into the bottom three on goal difference. </p>\n<p>\nKean said: âIâm frustrated and disappointed.

Your church where you had been the priest in charge for many years.â\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring Shipsidesâ tenure, he said up to seven bogus unions took place on one day. </p>\n<p>\nThe judge added: âYour criminal conduct appears to have been motivated as much by arrogance as by greed. </p>\n<p>\nâThere really is no mitigation in respect of this type of offending which undermines UK immigration law, threatens the benefit system and exploits the lives of many vulnerable and desperate people.â\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"caption":"Jailed ...

Mr Cameron issued a statement honouring the war dead of both sides â while praising the heroism of British forces who recaptured the Falklands at a cost of 255 lives. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe said: âThirty years ago today, the people of the Falkland Islands suffered an act of aggression that sought to rob them of their freedom and their way of life. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâToday is a day for commemoration and reflection, a day to remember all those who lost their lives. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâWe salute the heroism of the Task Force which set sail to free the islands.

Britain remains staunchly committed to upholding the right of the Falkland Islanders to determine their own future. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâThat was the fundamental principle that was at stake 30 years ago, and that is the principle which we solemnly reaffirm today.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Defence Secretary Philip Hammond dismissed claims that Britain could not defend the Falklands against another invasion.</i>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe insisted: âWe will defend them robustly.

I constantly felt tired, but didnât think it was anything serious. </p>\n<p>\nâBut it got worse and worse, I had no energy and just piled on the weight. </p>\n<p>\nâThe scariest point was falling asleep cutting a customerâs hair. It was awful. It would also happen in front of my friends. </p>\n<p>\nâSometimes they would spray cold water in my face to wake me up. I was so embarrassed.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe quit her job after the scissors incident. And her weight shot up so much she stopped leaving the house and gorged on takeaways because she was too tired to cook. </p>\n<p>\nMum-of-two Michelle &#151; who would nod off about 20 times a day &#151; was finally diagnosed after breaking down in tears during a visit to her GP. </p>\n<p>\nShe was told she had just one year to live. And doctors monitoring her breathing found it stopped 666 times in just four hours. </p>\n<p>\nHer lungs contained 35 per cent of the oxygen they needed and Michelleâs Body Mass Index was 59 &#151; obesity begins at 30. </p>\n<p>\nNow, after a Â£9,000 op on the NHS, Michelle is back to a healthy 12st &#151; and can enjoy a proper nightâs sleep. </p>\n<p>\nSpeaking of her ordeal, Michelle, from Stoke, Staffs, said: âI became a prisoner in my own home. I was just a recluse by the end; I was so big I couldnât do anything. My self-esteem was just so low, I would cry all the time. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nâI would sit on a stool to do anything and didnât go up the stairs at home for years. If I needed anything, I would get the kids to go. </p>\n<p>\nâTo do my washing I would wheel myself in a chair from the washing machine to the dryer. Walking a few paces was a nightmare. </p>\n<p>\nâWhen they gave me a year to live I knew I had to have the operation.â\n</p>\n<p>\nNow 15st lighter Michelle still keeps a pair of size-30 shorts in her wardrobe as a reminder of her former existence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says her children Jade, 19, and Carl, 17, have enjoyed seeing her change her habit of calling out for takeaways most nights of the week. </p>\n<p>\nAnd husband Carl, 42 &#151; who had also become overweight and was frustrated at having to do all of the familyâs shopping &#151; must also be pleased. </p>\n<p>\nMichelle admitted: âI was a bad yo-yo dieter. I would go to the slimming classes, lose a stone, then give up and gain three back on. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nâAs a family weâre all now a lot healthier than we used to be. But I was just lazy. My friends never had the heart to say you need to do something. </p>\n<p>\nâWhen my daughterâs friends saw me fall asleep and fall off the sofa they were in fits of laughter. </p>\n<p>\nâGetting clothes to fit me was expensive and I lost so much pride in my appearance that I would slob round the house in a big nightie most of the day. </p>\n<p>\nâIt was only when I went to my GP and burst into tears that we started to get the ball rolling to having the operation.â\n</p>\n<p>\nMichelle now loves clothes shopping, going for nights out again and hitting the gym three times a week after the successful surgery. </p>\n<p>\nShe is also back cutting the hair of friends and family and hopes to return to full-time work at a salon soon. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/sleep-532_1483469a.jpg","caption":"Transformation ...

But she was clearly still in party mode during a weekend night out with pals to Nu Bar in Loughton. </p>\n<p>\nPoor Lauren wonât be thrilled when she sees these pictures â sheâs already upset about her appearance in holiday snaps. </p>\n<p>\nShe told this weekâs New! magazine she had a great time abroad â but admitted she felt self-conscious in her bikini. </p>\n<p>\nLauren said: âI look overweight. I loved it but I absolutely hate the pictures. </p>\n<p>\n\"You know Iâm not over the moon about my weight but they were horrific. And I look miserable.â\n</p>\n<p>\nLauren feared that while on holiday her tight clothes made her look heavier than she is. But she appears to have made the same mistake again with Sunday nightâs spray-on jeans. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nDescribing her holiday clobber, she said: âMy outfit looks unflattering, like it doesnât fit me properly. I just looked dumpy.â\n</p>\n<p>\nNow Lauren plans to get her bikini body in tip-top shape before her next holiday to Marbella. She said: âI want to really work on it now. I want to lose two stone. I want to be a size eight to ten. It knocks your confidence.â\n</p>\n<p>\nLauren admits that alcohol calms her when sheâs feeling insecure. She said: âIn a situation like on holiday, I have to have a few drinks. It relaxes me so I donât care.â\n</p>\n<p>\nBut while she and TOWIE co-star James âArgâ Argent struggle to get fit, sexy Amy Childs has no such doubts about her figure. </p>\n<p>\nAmy said she loves her body so much that she wants to strip off and pose for Playboy. Thanks to a punishing regime for her new fitness DVD â Fit In 30 Days, which is out on Monday â Amy has shrunk to a sexy size six from size ten. </p>\n<p>\nBut the body-confident babe said she would only pose for the raunchy magazine when she was in her thirties. She said: âI wouldnât do nude, Iâve never done topless, but Iâd do a sexy shoot. When your career is over, get a million pounds. Perfect, done.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAmy, who claims sheâs too busy for love, says sheâs always loved her figure â but is getting a second boob job. </p>\n<p>\nShe told New! magazine: âItâll be four years since my last one and they are proper sagging. I look at pictures now and I notice the difference. When I first had them done they were perfect but now theyâre down a bit.â\n</p>\n<p>\nBut she warned young girls that getting breast implants was not a decision to be taken lightly. She stressed: âJust donât rush into it, really go to the consultations.â\n</p>\n<p>\nAmy also admitted she was worried about the procedure after model Danielle Lloyd was rushed to hospital when one of her implants exploded. The reality star added: âIâm more nervous the second time round. But I really want them done.â\n</p>\n<p>\nShe revealed she has exciting projects in the pipeline, including a new show based on Paris Hiltonâs The Simple Life, which sheâll star in with cousin Harry Derbidge. </p>\n<p>\nDescribing her workout release, she said: âItâs hard work, and you see me struggling â I canât do it easily. But if you motivate yourself youâll be able to do it. There are a lot of toning treatments.

I know itâs a controversial thing to get your kids involved in, but I think people read too much into it. </p>\n<p>\nâTheir confidence has shot through the roof since theyâve started competing. Itâs wonderful watching my kids doing so well. </p>\n<p>\nâThereâs such a buzz about the UK scene â itâs fresh and exciting. Itâs so rewarding being right at the forefront of it and Iâve never heard of as big a family as mine getting involved.â\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanneâs obsession was sparked by seeing footage of American pageants and has escalated so much in the past 12 months that normal family life at their home in Lincoln has been put on hold. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: âThe glitz and glamour come at a high price. Youâre talking at least Â£500 to Â£600 per child per competition. Thereâs the entry fee plus travel expenses, costumes and grooming on top. </p>\n<p>\nâThe dresses alone cost Â£300 to Â£400, and you canât wear them more than once. </p>\n<p>\nâThe shoes cost up to Â£60 a pair. </p>\n<p>\nâThen thereâs all the beauty, the hair, nails and tan.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nEvenings are spent searching YouTube for clips of the biggest and best pageant stars for inspiration. </p>\n<p>\nMost nights after school the kids practise their choreography for the talent round and try out their hair and make-up. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âItâs the nature of the scene â to stay at the top, youâve got to keep going bigger.â\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandma Joyce, 49, a former pub landlady, is a dab hand with a needle and has made countless âone-offâ outfits for the troupe. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âItâs so important to have good costumes. My mum is brilliant. Sheâs really talented at making fabulous costumes, so thankfully we donât have to buy them all.â\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery weekend, James, 29 â who is stepdad to the two eldest kids â looks after baby Niyah, while Leanne, Joyce, Tia, Courtney and Ellie check out shops nationwide to find fabrics and accessories. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âOur outgoings are sky-high. James and I have cut back so much. Weâve gone from taking two holidays a year to one and when we do go away we stay in the UK. </p>\n<p>\nâWe donât eat out much any more and I buy my clothes from budget stores such as Primark and Asda so I can plough money back in to the kidsâ pageant wardrobe.â\n</p>\n<p>\nThe result of all their effort is a mantelpiece full of awards. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âThe kids are all naturals, especially Tia, who won the Tiny Miss North crown in her first ever competition. All my kids have the pageant bug â even my three-year-old son.â\n</p>\n<p>\nThis year the family are going even further, as Tia prepares to become the first British competitor in the Dream Girls USA pageant in St Louis, Missouri. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âIn Tiaâs last competition, she danced to Copacabana by Barry Manilow. </p>\n<p>\nâSome people think the song is inappropriate for an eight-year-old but she doesnât understand the words. Itâs just a good beat to perform to.â </p>\n<p>\nRecently Leanne and Joyce have found it hard to find the sort of bold, ostentatious outfits that they say are needed to stand out. </p>\n<p>\nSo they plan to launch their own online pageant boutique. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âMum made the showgirl costume for the Copacabana dance and it went down a storm. </p>\n<p>\nâItâs really hard to find unique âwow-wearâ here and itâs expensive to ship it from the US. </p>\n<p>\nâThis is an ideal opportunity to turn something we love into a business venture. Thereâs the market for it and it means that weâll stay right at the forefront of pageant fashion.â\n</p>\n<p>\nThe US pageant scene has been growing for decades and has received a lot of attention in the UK. </p>\n<p>\nIt was notorious US cable TV series Toddlers & Tiaras that first got full-time mum Leanne hooked. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: âWe would watch it as a family and Iâd be blown away by the glamour. Tia loved it too and was the natural leader. </p>\n<p>\nâI think the other kids may have seen how much time I spent with Tia and felt a bit jealous. With six kids, thereâs always rivalry.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly 15-year-old Josh has opted to stay out of the spotlight, though he helps by babysitting during pageant season, from March to October. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne is behind all of her kids when it comes to their pageant careers, but she insists she is realistic. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: âWe want to let them all dip their toe in and try it but I know itâs not for everyone.â\n</p>\n<p>\nAll the same, she wouldnât want to see the kids quit on a whim â especially Tia, who has had a flush of wins. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âWeâd never force her to do anything she didnât want. But weâd be reluctant to let her just walk away. </p>\n<p>\nâSheâs so good and weâve invested so much. </p>\n<p>\nâAlthough itâs not all about the winning, itâs a lot of money to spend if you donât succeed.â\n</p>\n<p>\nLeanne dismisses the objections that are often levelled at pageants, insisting the outlandish outfits and make-up are harmless dressing up. </p>\n<p>\nShe adds: âKids wear less during the summer holidays on the streets in Blackpool. </p>\n<p>\nâStrangers arenât going to walk off the street and see my kids in a swimsuit, because all the events are ticketed. </p>\n<p>\nâAnd not every competition is full glitz. Theyâve all done great in natural pageants too.â\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Woodalls intend to keep following their pageant dream for as long as they can. </p>\n<p>\nLeanne says: âI am so excited waiting for pageant season to get into full swing. </p>\n<p>\nâWeâll all be spending loads of time together doing what we love most.â\n</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\">\nmyView </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<br></br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>By Dr LINDA PAPADOPOULOS, </b>Psychologist </p>\n<p>\nTHE notion of little girls enjoying dressing up is nothing new and there is nothing wrong with them role-playing. </p>\n<p>\nWhat is concerning is that in competitions such as these, they are encouraged to experiment with themes they may not be ready to deal with. </p>\n<p>\nThese girls are being judged on their appearance. They are aware that to succeed they not only need to act a certain way but to look a certain way. </p>\n<p>\nThis is an unhealthy and potentially dangerous message. </p>\n<p>\nWe also need to consider the impact of wearing clothes that are designed to highlight sexual characteristics they do not yet possess. </p>\n<p>\nJudging girls on how they look devalues them and teaches them to base their self-worth on being appealing to others. That is simply not fair to them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>Additional reporting: Naomi Rainey </b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4113318/Pageant-mums-two-girls-compete-for-victory.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Pageant mum's two girls compete for victory"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3986933/TV-show-has-kids-dressed-as-drag-queens.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"TV show has kids dressed as drag queens"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4176098/Miss-Asia-UK-I-went-from-tomboy-to-beauty-queen.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Miss Asia UK: I went from tomboy to beauty queen"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/3968236/I-know-45k-is-a-lot-to-spend-on-a-six-year-old-but-Nancy-is-going-to-be-a-celebrity.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"I know £45k is a lot to spend on a six-year-old but Nancy is going to be a celebrity","br":[null,null,null]}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/parenting/3920887/As-six-year-old-Bonnie-leaves-the-stage-her-mum-says-That-was-terrible-Daddy-will-be-so-disappointed.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"As six-year-old Bonnie leaves the stage her mum says, 'That was terrible...

His owner, teaching assistant Amy Barratt-Singh, 25, from Birmingham, is a Scorpio. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âThis confident and brave canine aims to protect and guard his family. From a young age you have been able to see early signs of his assertive, leadership potential. Sometimes this can come across to others as aggressive in style. </p>\n<p>\nâHe is energetic and at times may well believe that heâs in charge. </p>\n<p>\nâThere may be a power struggle between the signs of owner Amy and Bo-Duppy.â\n</p>\n<p>\nAmy says: âBo-Duppy is certainly confident and brave. He is protective to the extreme and when we are in the street he will not let a stranger come anywhere near me. </p>\n<p>\nâHe definitely shows leadership potential. He rules the roost in my house.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nTaurus<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>April 21 - May 21 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nLABRADOR Tumble, two, is a Taurus. He is owned by five-year-old Ben Watkins, from Tamworth, Staffs, who is a Libra. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âHis pup tends to have a calm attitude. He adores meal times but it has to be the leanest, finest and tastiest food available. </p>\n<p>\nâWatch his weight, you donât want his beautiful appearance spoilt. </p>\n<p>\nâA Libra and Taurus relationship should work very well as both signs are ruled by the planet of love.â\n</p>\n<p>\nBen says: âTumble is very greedy, so we do have to watch that he doesnât eat too much dog food, otherwise he will get fat. </p>\n<p>\nâHe can get a bit excitable but normally he is quite calm and lets me lie and play on him. Really he is my best friend in the whole world.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nGemini<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>May 22 - June 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDAVE is nine months old, a miniature schnauzer and is a Gemini. He lives with Taurus nail technician Zoe Pocock, 36, in Borough, South London. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âThis canine loves accompanying you everywhere and finding out what everyoneâs been up to. </p>\n<p>\nâHe can move like lightning, is extremely bright and adores learning new tricks. His quick mind canât bear to be bored, so donât leave him alone for long if you value your home. The only problem between owner and pet will be Dave does not need to eat as much as Zoe thinks he does.â\n</p>\n<p>\nZoe says: âDave sleeps in his own bed and loves cuddles with his mum. He loves biting and stealing peopleâs slippers and shoes.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nCancer<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>June 22 - July 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBORDER terrier Dotty, eight, is a Cancer. Dental hygienist owner Alison Seymour, 47, is an Aquarius and lives in Winchester, Hants. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âDotty, the Cancerian canine, probably tends to be a home-bird. </p>\n<p>\n\"She is sensitive, caring â and an excellent addition to the family. </p>\n<p>\nâSoft and gentle on the inside but she can present a rather crusty outer shell to the world. An Aquarius owner will love observing the personality of a Cancerian pet â they will get on well.â\n</p>\n<p>\nAlison says: âThis sums Dotty up. She is very home-loving and is always a bit unsure when weâre away on holiday.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nLeo<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>July 23 - August 23 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nGERMAN shepherd Sky is two and a Leo.

She needs to shine and be treated like the queen she is. </p>\n<p>\nâGrooming procedures will give her the feeling of being adored. </p>\n<p>\nâNever ever scold, her loving heart simply couldnât bear it. </p>\n<p>\nâThings between owner and pet should work well as long as Sky gets lavished with praise.â\n</p>\n<p>\nShelley says: âThis is very true, Sky is loving, loyal and trusting but sometimes thinks her way is the right way and doesnât listen.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nVirgo<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>August 24 - September 22 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBRITISH Blue cat Martha, two, is a Virgo. Her owner, Sun beauty writer Lauren Naylor, 31, lives in Wapping, East London, and is a Leo. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âDo make sure Marthaâs bed and bowls are spotless as sheâs a stickler for cleanliness. She can be a bit of a fussy eater too. </p>\n<p>\nâShe thrives on predictability and routine.

He lives with Cancerian office worker Maggie Morgan, 42, in Hamble, Hants. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âThe Scorpio canine tends to be suspicious by nature and terribly nosy which makes him an excellent choice as an airport sniffer dog. Your relationship is likely to be intense, as he may not be happy to share you. </p>\n<p>\nâHe sometimes likes to hide things so you may one day stumble upon hidden treasures that perhaps you thought were lost. </p>\n<p>\nâIn the stars, owner and pet are a good mix because both appreciate closeness.â\n</p>\n<p>\nMaggie says: âOn every walk, Barney has his nose to the ground, sniffing out who has been out and about on his patch. </p>\n<p>\nâIâm sure heâd be an excellent sniffer dog if heâd been properly trained. </p>\n<p>\nâOnly he knows where he keeps his stash of my socks and gloves.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nSagittarius<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>November 23 - December 21 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nMOGGY Forbes, four, is a Sagittarius.

His sleep patterns differ on a nightly basis and he will often be awake all night if he is bored in the day. </p>\n<p>\nâHe also likes nothing more than to go on an adventure â usually to stay at my parentsâ house when I go on holiday.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>\nCapricorn<br></br> </h1>\n<p>\n<b>December 22 - January 20 </b>\n</p>\n<p>\nBLACK and white puss Freddie, six, is a Capricorn and lives with Libran teacher James Burrows, 32, in Colchester, Essex. </p>\n<p>\nFiona says: âThe Capricorn pet takes life very seriously.

It was in a terrible state, covered in excrement and dirt and the children could access dangerous areas of the house, including the kitchen. </p>\n<p>\nâThe defendant was, in due course, found in the garden shed intoxicated, having been out the night before and was still dressed for a night out. </p>\n<p>\nâThe officers described the house as being in a vile state. </p>\n<p>\nâFood debris was all over the living room, the sofa was filthy, there was a broken tumble dryer in the kitchen, there was no bedding on some of the beds and there was rubbish in the bath. </p>\n<p>\nâThere was excrement everywhere and a general air of neglect.â\n</p>\n<p>\nPalmer claimed she had fallen asleep on a friendâs sofa after a night out, and returned to her home to find the police there. </p>\n<p>\nWhile she was gone, her children had climbed out of a window and begun running around in the street. </p>\n<p>\nAfter spotting the police van outside her house, she apparently decided to hide in the shed. </p>\n<p>\nUnemployed Palmer, who has two previous cautions for shoplifting, said she was âdevastatedâ by her actions. </p>\n<p>\nBut she claimed that she had not been living at the address, and was expecting to be re-housed the next day. </p>\n<p>\nShe told the police: âI have never done it before. Iâm devastated. </p>\n<p>\n\"There is no excuse. I just lost the plot and gave up on the house. </p>\n<p>\nâEverything was a total tip. I was expecting to be rehoused.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRecorder Paul Miller told Palmer: âYour children were found in the street, anything could have happened to them but happily they came to no physical or psychological harm. </p>\n<p>\nâIt is clear not all of your problems are your own making. You have suffered a depressive period in the past, but it is no excuse to effectively give up responsibility\"\n</p>\n<p>\nPalmer was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and a 12-month supervision order. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4167636/Lisa-Brooks-and-Tomas-Lewis-jailed-after-boy-3-nearly-died-in-cell.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Pair jailed after boy, 3, nearly died in freezing & dark ‘punishment cell’"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/negelect_main_1482832a.jpg","caption":"Guilty ... mum Laura Palmer"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/neglectmu7m2_1482835a.jpg"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/carousel-mum-top_1482958a.jpg","caption":"Drunk home alone mum hid in shed - three filth-caked kids ran by busy roads, cops found mother still in clubbing gear"}]}},{"imageportrait":true,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Fan ...

See how here","timestamp":"Mon, 02 Apr 2012 11:38:00 +0100","articlebody":"<p>\nLESS is more when it comes to working out. Doing as little as four minutes  or one \"HIT\"  can be better for you than an hour's slog. </p>\n<p>\nThe four-minute, high-intensity training session can increase your aerobic and anaerobic capacity and speed up the metabolism, helping you burn more fat and make you look 200 per cent leaner than a traditional 60-minute aerobic workout. </p>\n<p>\nKnown as the closest thing we have to a fitness miracle, the HIT workout is loved by researchers and fitness pros alike for its fat-torching abilities and simplicity. </p>\n<p>\nCeleb fans include Jessica Biel and Cameron Diaz. </p>\n<p>\nHIT workouts are not easy, but are appealing to time-starved mums, working women and anyone juggling a hectic life. </p>\n<p>\nSun fitness expert Nicki Waterman says: \"My advice is to combine your plan with 30 minutes of aerobic exercise like fast walking, jogging, swimming, cycling or dancing, for example, to get the maximum effect. </p>\n<p>\n\"To do a HIT, simply pick an exercise and set a timer for 20 seconds on and ten seconds rest. </p>\n<p>\n\"Do the exercise as hard as you possibly can for 20 seconds and then rest for ten, repeating eight to 20 times in total. And remember, you have to work to 100 per cent maximum intensity. By the end of the four minutes you should feel like you've done a full workout and have nothing else to give.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out my favourites to get you started for one week. </p>\n<p>\nBut please check with your doctor before starting this exercise programme. And always warm up and cool down for at least five minutes before and after each HIT session. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>MONDAY:</b> <b>Skipping</b> </p>\n<p>\nCARDIO and coordination all in one. Take a skipping rope and jump as fast as you can, using whichever foot pattern you like. </p>\n<p>\nOptions include both feet together, high knees, the \"boxer shuffle\" with heels in front, alternating feet, and butt-kickers. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Make sure your rope is long enough before you start  nothing ruins a good HIT workout like getting whipped across your calves. </p>\n<p>\nTo check for proper length, stand in the centre of your rope and pull the handles straight up. They should come at least as high as your armpits. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>TUESDAY:</b> <b>Jumping Lunges</b> </p>\n<p>\nYou already know and love (to hate?) lunges for their butt-blasting ability. Add a jump in between alternating legs to up the difficulty and cardio factor. </p>\n<p>\nStart by stepping your right foot forward into a deep lunge, until your leg is parallel with the ground. Then jump, bringing your back (left) foot forward and landing in a lunge. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> You can step through each lunge if jumping gets too hard. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WEDNESDAY:</b> <b>Box Jumps</b> </p>\n<p>\nFind a weight bench, or a step that hits somewhere between your shins and your knees. </p>\n<p>\nStand in front of it and jump on top of the bench/step with both feet together. </p>\n<p>\nJump back to the floor, again with both feet together. Try not to rest when you land and jump right back up again. </p>\n<p>\nIf this is too difficult, you can do step-ups onto the box instead. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>THURSDAY:</b> <b>Mountain Climbers</b> </p>\n<p>\nMake a triangle with your hands and feet on the floor with your butt up in the air. Bring one leg towards your chest. Keeping hands on the ground, jump to switch your legs. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Just quickly touch each toe down so you're not resting by putting whole foot down. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>FRIDAY:</b> <b>Hindu Squats</b> </p>\n<p>\nThese are similar to a traditional squat but instead of stopping when your thighs are parallel to the ground, you continue down, dropping your butt towards your heels until your fingertips brush the ground. </p>\n<p>\nGoing through the full range of motion gets your heart rate up faster and engages more muscles. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> Don't be afraid  contrary to popular belief, researchers now say that for healthy people, squatting to the ground won't hurt your knees. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SATURDAY: Bicycle Sprints</b> </p>\n<p>\nBikes are perfect for engaging your whole lower body and really getting your heart rate up for those 20 seconds. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Tip:</b> It's a little easier to time and to rest on a stationary bike  you can just take your feet off the pedals for ten seconds rather than trying to start and stop/coast on the road. </p>\n<p>\nThe HIT diet plan </p>\n<p>\n<b>SUN nutritionist Amanda Ursell says:</b> \"If your aim is to lose weight, then you need to combine your workout with a style of eating that provides energy to exercise, yet cuts empty calories that are keeping your body mass index high. </p>\n<p>\n\"Timing of your meals and snacks is especially important because your body needs fuel to cope with the HIT workout before you start and, once you have finished, to allow your muscles to recover and be ready for the next hard session. </p>\n<p>\n\"Here's how to eat to lose weight but keep your body healthy and able to cope with the HIT plan over the coming week.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Before you train:</b> Whether you train before breakfast, before lunch or at the end of the day before dinner, have something like a handful of raisins, a banana or even a small smoothie an hour to 30 minutes before you start. </p>\n<p>\n<b>During training:</b> Drink \"to thirst\". This simply means have a drink when you feel the need and stop once you no longer feel thirsty. </p>\n<p>\n<b>After training:</b> Have your meal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner within half an hour of finishing. If you can't manage this, have another small snack like some dried fruit or a cereal bar. </p>\n<p>\n<b>YOUR DAILY DIET</b> </p>\n<p>\n<b>Breakfast:</b> This is not the week to skip breakfast, however rushed your daily schedule. </p>\n<p>\nIf you are training early, have breakfast once you have finished. If not, make time to have it before you leave the house. </p>\n<p>\nHave a breakfast of porridge made with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk with some dried fruit such as chopped apricots; a wholegrain cereal such as Oatibix or Weetabix or a fruit salad which includes a banana with some zero per cent fat Total Greek yoghurt and a handful of sunflower seeds. </p>\n<p>\nAlternatively, have two poached or boiled eggs with two pieces of toast and a glass of orange or apple juice. </p>\n<p>\nHave a glass of water and your usual cup of tea or coffee using skimmed milk. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-morning:</b> Have a handful of nuts such as almonds, cashews, pistachios or Brazil nuts with an apple, orange or a pear and a glass of water. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Lunch:</b> Build your lunch around an average-sized portion of carbohydrate foods that give you a steady supply of energy. These include pitta breads, tortilla wraps, bread, pasta, noodles, or a baked potato. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich food such as tuna, chicken, turkey, lean slices of roast beef, hard-boiled eggs, prawns, cottage or ricotta cheese, pulses such as baked beans, peas or lentils, tofu or Quorn products. </p>\n<p>\nHave some veg with these such as tomato and cucumber in a sandwich, lettuce and spring onions in a wrap or pitta or salad with a baked potato and baked beans. Always have some water with your lunch. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Mid-afternoon:</b> A couple of oat cakes with some cottage or ricotta cheese and berries; a slice of peanut butter on toast; an apple with a small matchbox-size piece of reduced-fat Cheddar or a handful of mixed nuts and raisins. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Dinner:</b> As with lunchtime, dinner needs to be a mix of an average-size serving of carbohydrate-based foods such as new boiled potatoes, pasta, rice or noodles. </p>\n<p>\nTo these add some protein-rich foods such as lean red meat  lean mince, a lean pork chop or lean roast lamb; Turkey, chicken or ham; grilled, baked or canned fish; tofu, Quorn mince or \"chicken\" pieces, pulses such as baked beans. </p>\n<p>\nAlso add some vegetables.

She was strict, but wanted a daughter who could look after herself. </p>\n<p>\nI was not the easiest of girls to bring up. From very young I seemed to know what I wanted to do in life  singing, dancing, acting. </p>\n<p>\nIt meant my mum had to drive for miles to take me to various classes. She was always encouraging about self-improvement. </p>\n<p>\nShe took me to auditions in Los Angeles, which was on the other side of the country from where we lived in Florida. </p>\n<p>\nI was born in Oak Ridge, a small town in Tennessee, but was brought up mostly in St Petersburg, Florida, after my mother remarried. </p>\n<p>\nWhen she and Dad were together, they did not have much money. But I was happy as a kid. </p>\n<p>\nIt made me realise you don't have to be rich to be happy. My dad used to hunt ducks and my mum would put them in the pot. We lived modestly. </p>\n<p>\nMy mum says I was born really ballsy. She's put up with it very well. </p>\n<p>\nI attended a Pentecostal church and then a Christian school. I had to obey strict rules at school and at home. I was grounded a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI got a diploma from a correspondence programme. It was the deal I made with my mum. I had to have a real diploma before she would allow me to drop out of Christian school and move to Los Angeles. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some struggles along the way, which my mum has seen me through. I am also not the easiest of people to be friends with. </p>\n<p>\nI think it is my fault. I work away from home and have learned to be on my own. </p>\n<p>\nI don't socialise much on a film set and don't have to become best friends with the people I work with. </p>\n<p>\nThere is a saying in Hollywood that what happens on a film set stays on a film set. But if I'd ever dated a co-star, it would have been downright depressing. Most actors would not appeal to most women, if they actually met them. </p>\n<p>\nI met Brian when I was 18. I was too young to remember his show, Beverly Hills 90210, so I didn't know who he was. But I knew I was instantly in love. </p>\n<p>\nThere is no secret to being a sex symbol. I play the game, that's all. </p>\n<p>\nIf people want to think of me as wild and crazy, that's up to them. The fact is, I've only had two serious boyfriends in my life  and I married one. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nI have the same hang-ups as any other girl. Am I too fat? Too thin? Do I wear the right clothes? You think about it so much, it can hurt how you live. </p>\n<p>\nSo am I insecure? God, yes. Show me a woman who says she's totally secure about everything in her life and I will show you a pain in the ass. </p>\n<p>\nThere have been some bad moments along the way, during which calls to my mum have meant a lot. </p>\n<p>\nI lived in New York, doing TV comedy Hope &amp; Faith, and it was cold and miserable. </p>\n<p>\nI was either at work or home in a little apartment, on my own. I let whole days slip by, doing nothing. </p>\n<p>\nI am confident in how I project myself but not in terms of how I look. It all came to a head when I was making 2008 film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People in London. </p>\n<p>\nThere was one scene in which I danced around in lingerie. I suddenly felt like I couldn't do the scene and asked if I could wear a skirt. </p>\n<p>\nThe director, quite rightly, said it would look ridiculous. </p>\n<p>\nBut I was not happy. It ended up with the producer serving me a beer before the scene. I was tired from working non-stop on several films, was suffering from jet lag on the trip to England and started to worry about my ability. </p>\n<p>\nThat's where Mum comes in. I called her a few times from London and she was able to calm me down and encourage me. </p>\n<p>\nI am still her little girl, whatever way you want to look at it. </p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4225465/Is-Megan-Fox-expecting-a-baby.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Is Megan Fox expecting a baby?"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/4225048/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-stars-in-new-trailer-to-The-Dictator.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"The Dictator will rule screens this Spring"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4192011/Megan-Fox-serves-up-a-tasty-treat-in-new-advert.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Megan Fox serves up a tasty treat in new advert"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4164565/Megan-Fox-is-the-face-of-an-Angel-in-latest-shoot.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Megan's the face of an Angel in latest shoot"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4160020/Megan-Fox-tattoo-Star-is-having-her-Marilyn-Monroe-inking-lasered-off.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My tattoos are a Meg-a mistake"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/4145794/Megan-Fox-looks-hot-in-her-bikini-in-Kona-Hawaii.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"Megan Fox is back in her bikini"}}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02FOXX_1482370a.jpg","caption":"'Mum says I was born ballsy' ... actress Megan Fox"},{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01482/SNF02MEG2-_1482371a.jpg"}]}},{"imageportrait":false,"imagelarge":true,"subdeck":"Cheat is on ...

The way I see it, I'm helping the women because the men go home happier. I provide an emotional outlet for men bored by their wives.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn fact, she jokingly refers to herself as \"an alternative marriage counsellor\".\n</p>\n<p>\nShe continues: \"As well as satisfying them, I also give the men advice on their failing personal lives. I love the excitement of doing something I shouldn't.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"And, what's even better is I can hand them back to their wives when I'm done.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>A \"feisty\" woman who has never had a problem getting a date, Dee first went out with a taken man about four years ago.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I enjoyed my time with him and, although it came to an end, it didn't put me off.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I loved the fact I could be with him when it suited me and I didn't have to be exclusively with him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nFinding herself single again in January after a long-term relationship, Dee decided she was going to hunt down more married men to get some excitement back in her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I just wanted some fun  so I typed 'meet a married man' into an internet search engine.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin minutes, Dee had created an online profile on the website Illicit Encounters and was receiving loads of requests for dates.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"It is so flattering and exciting. I love knowing that all these men want is to take me out and ravish me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>With no baggage, no strings and no emotional involvement, Dee could have her cake and eat it  at the expense of somebody else.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShockingly, these types of websites actually facilitate affairs for people who are unhappy in their sex-less relationships but have no intention of leaving their partner.\n</p>\n<p>\nCareer girl Dee is currently seeing three married men \"on rotation\".\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explains: \"Once a fortnight, the men will take me out to posh restaurants or for drinks in swanky bars  I even cook dinner for one of them at my house.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Amazingly, Dee doesn't feel any guilt.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"They are the ones cheating, not me. I have spent all of my adult life in relationships where I have to think about the other person. I deserve time when I only have to think of myself  I am too independent to be in a relationship at the moment.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNaturally, most people who use the site do so in secret. She says: \"I find it safer to keep phone contact to a minimum. I don't want anyone's wife to find out.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I wait for them to contact me  then I know it is safe to reply.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee feels this type of dating is particularly good because she gets treated like a princess.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I get taken to top restaurants and many of the men buy me elaborate gifts  one guy bought me a TV and DVD player. But most importantly, I get showered with affection.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Ultimately, after a few dates, the evening out will result in sex. If a guy calls and I'm not in the mood, I say so. If, by the end of the date, I want to invite them in, that's my prerogative. I'm totally in control and I love that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee isn't physical with all of them  some men she \"helps\" just want to talk to her. In fact, she has stayed in steady contact with one man since November but knows she will never meet him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"We are having an email affair, if there is such a thing,\" she explains.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He and I both know that we will never meet due to distance but this suits us both  we flirt and chat online.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There is obviously something missing in his life that I fill. I am happy to oblige  he is very sweet to me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Although the majority of her dating experiences have been good, there have been some disastrous ones too.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"It's always a nightmare when they fall in love with you. One guy declared that I belonged to him after only two dates.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"He told me that I wasn't allowed to date or flirt with any other men  hypocritical as he had a wife at home. I ended that quickly.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee admits she likes Illicit Encounters because of the upwardly mobile men that the site claims to attract. She says: \"On the whole, all of the users are in well-paid jobs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The calibre of males I am meeting is certainly what makes me go back for more. They are all well-groomed and sophisticated. Who wouldn't want to be showered with gifts and shown a luxurious lifestyle?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAsked if she ever gets attached to the men she sleeps with, the answer is a firm no. \"I just switch off. I make my intentions clear from the start and once the guidelines are set, there's no going back.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Dee makes extramarital affairs look easy, but they do come with risks.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"All of these men have children and some have been caught out, \"It may sound stupid, but I actually think most of the wives involved just turn a blind eye to their husband's infidelity. They have a lifestyle they want to protect.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Many have the car, the home, the children, the holidays. If they finished the relationship, they would risk losing all that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"There is nothing more exciting than knowing I'll get to flirt over a candlelit dinner or secretly hold hands in the cinema.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I know most people think this is all about sex, but it isn't. Despite what people assume, there is an emotional connection and we do think of each other. I wouldn't sleep with just anyone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Since I initially logged on, I have only been on dates with around 12 men in total  I am still fussy.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"In a nutshell, I am a bubbly and outgoing woman who loves attention but doesn't want a relationship  this type of lifestyle is tailor-made for me!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>But this isn't a life that Dee will continue with forever.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I'll stay on the site for a year or so then make a decision about what I want from there. I'm going travelling at Christmas, so it suits me to have another six months of no-strings fun.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nDee describes her last three months as \"feeling like a kid in a sweet shop\".\n</p>\n<p>\nShe explains: \"I'm addicted to the thrill of it. I've found that some of the men are separated but not divorced yet. I'm not interested in them, it's not exciting enough. I go for the ones who are still married.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Asked how she would feel if her future husband cheated on her, she chuckles:</i> <i>\"Of course I'd be upset, but there's no way I'll ever conform  that's just the way I am.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4212923/Meet-the-people-attracted-to-objects.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"The best sex of my life?

Their clothes may act as armour, diverting attention from them. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nCameron Diaz </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Style:</b> The film star's relaxed look indicates a more carefree and grounded personality. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret:</b> When someone feels they are seen chiefly as a sex object, they may downplay their feminine side to show there is more to their character. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h1>\nKate, Duchess of Cambridge </h1>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>Style:</b> As a younger Royal, Kate could push the boat out more with her outfits but plays it safe. </p>\n<p>\n<b>Style secret:</b> Kate probably likes to maintain routine and please others.

It's incredible and I love the new improved me. </p>\n<p>\n\"<i>My photo journey reminds me of how hard I worked to get where I am today and I hope it inspires other women to begin their own journey.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of 24, Nicola was 16 stone and by the time she was 34 she weighed 24st. </p>\n<p>\nShe recalls: \"I worried if I was going to fit through a small gap or get stuck on a small chair. So I'd try to avoid putting myself in potentially embarrassing situations. </p>\n<p>\n\"For breakfast, I'd have four slices of toast. For lunch I'd make a sandwich with four slices of white bread with double the filling. </p>\n<p>\n\"Dinners were always whatever was quick. Pasta bakes, pizzas and takeaways were my regular meals of choice. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My biggest weakness though, were crisps. I'd never go a day without eating at least three bags. </p>\n<p>\n\"Working as a primary school teacher, the staff room is always full of cakes and chocolates to snack on during break times.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola, of Llanelli, Wales, was eating around 4,900 calories a day, 2,900 above the recommended intake. And it affected her confidence. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"Trying to run around with the kids during PE lessons and teaching them about healthy lifestyles was always difficult as I felt like a hypocrite.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also struggled to find clothes to flatter her huge frame. She continues: \"I had to settle for T-shirts that managed to cover my enormous body and trousers that didn't dig in to my sides. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The only things that looked good were shoes. I loved being able to walk into High Street shops and pick out a pair of pretty high heels, slip them on my feet and feel sexy. </p>\n<p>\n\"So I went crazy for them. Platforms, stilettos, boots, wedges  you name them, I had a pair. In every colour and for every occasion I had shoes that made me feel great. </p>\n<p>\n\"Worth more than &#163;3,500, I had just over 100 pairs in my collection before my life changed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, in December 2007, Nicola joined a weekly slimming class  purely to keep a friend company. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"I swapped white bread for brown, reduced my portion sizes and snacked on fruit and veg. I found it surprisingly refreshing to come out of my normal convenience eating routine and try something new.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin a month, Nicola had shed 10lb. Yet she struggled to see a difference in her appearance. </p>\n<p>\n\"So my friend suggested taking a picture to show me how well I'd done. It was the motivation I needed to carry on,\" she says. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"Comparing myself month by month stunned me. My face was thinner and I could notice the difference in my waistline and arms.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I began looking forward to each month when the time came to take a picture and compare myself to the previous one.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nNicola also joined women-only gym Curves and began working out twice a week. </p>\n<p>\nShe says: \"After the first year I'd lost five stone  down from 24st to 19st. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"My meals changed completely to consist of a piece of toast for breakfast, a sandwich with two pieces of brown bread for lunch, fruit for a snack and meat with vegetables for dinner. </p>\n<p>\n\"Looking at myself filled me with pride and the compliments I was receiving from friends and family were incredible. </p>\n<p>\n\"I was determined this wasn't going to just be a fad diet phase  this was a new lifestyle for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the next three years she lost a further six stone, dropping to 13st 2lb. </p>\n<p>\nNicola says: \"Every woman wants to look their best in a photo. </p>\n<p>\n\"If I was ever tempted to have a take-away binge at the end of the month, I'd think about having my picture taken and it would put me off.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd for shoe-mad Nicola there was only one way to mark her sensational new figure. </p>\n<p>\n<i>\"In January this year I splashed out on a beautiful pair of &#163;380 cream Jimmy Choo shoes to celebrate.\"</i>\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4210484/Ive-tried-61-different-diets-since-I-was-13.html?iPadApp=true","caption":{"#":"I've tried 61 different diets since I was 13"}},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4205741/Women-who-have-given-up-alcohol.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Why we're all tee totally happy"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4201637/My-8-year-takeaway-binge-cost-25kand-my-unborn-babys-life.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"My 8-year takeaway binge cost £25k...and my unborn baby's life"},{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/4198372/Steps-news-Claire-Richards-on-why-she-is-proud-to-be-a-size-16.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"'I'm proud to be UK average size 16.

Well a few words from across the pond â and the Redsâ American owners â certainly would not go amiss.</p>\n<p>After Sundayâs shocker away to Newcastle, more the events surrounding the defeat than the loss itself, the forums and phone-ins have once again been flooded by those questioning whether Kenny Dalglish is up to the job.</p>\n<p>Yet all weâve had from America, and Fenway Sports Group, has been the sound of silence. And going into such a crucial couple of weeks, that is doing nobody any good at all.</p>\n<p>Should Dalglish get the push? Should they cut their losses on the signings who have flopped? Or should they stick with them in the belief they will come good in the end?</p>\n<p>All questions being raised by those keen to take a pot-shot at King Kenny and the club.</p>\n<p>In my view, the Americans should stick with Dalglish at least until Christmas â and only then consider a change of manager if things arenât going well.</p>\n<p>I know the owners didnât buy the club with the aim of winning the Carling Cup and hopefully the FA Cup. They signed up for title challenges and Champions League charges and, right now, they are a million miles off that.</p>\n<p>But the fact is they could still end this season with two trophies and they would have been happy with that at the start of it.</p>\n<p>Yet the one thing you need if youâre going to be successful is unity.</p>\n<p>And the Americans could help a lot in that direction with just a few public words of backing.</p>\n<p>Just a couple of sentences is all it would take. Something along the lines of âKennyâs the manager we want, weâve got faith in what heâs doing and thereâs still a lot to play forâ.</p>\n<p>If they want to go back to being silent after that, fair enough.</p>\n<p>But right now they do need to say something, if only to allow everyone to focus on what REALLY matters â matches and results.</p>\n<p>And letâs be honest, everyone at Liverpool has to be pulling in the right direction if they are to avoid the season disappearing down the plughole.</p>\n<p>Theyâll be facing a rampant Everton side in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday week, a world away from the one which lost the derby at Anfield recently.</p>\n<p>So what better way to give a message of unity than hearing one from the very top? At least then there will be no distractions from the job in hand.</p>\n<p>I must admit any other manager than Dalglish would have been on the thinnest of ice there if league results had gone as they have of late.</p>\n<p>But they wanted Roy Hodgson out, they wanted Dalglish in and thatâs what they got â and owners, fans, the lot have to support him and the club more than ever at the moment.</p>\n<p>And I include the players in that, because there are a few who owe him a heck of a lot. Not least of them Andy Carroll.</p>\n<p>His reaction at being taken off at Newcastle, in cursing in full view of everyone, could well have been out of disappointment at his own performance rather than abuse at Dalglish.</p>\n<p>But he should have been more professional about things and after the faith Kenny has shown in him, he certainly needs to repay a little.</p>\n<p>I couldnât believe the way he went sprawling to try to win a penalty when heâd have had a tap-in by staying on his feet.

But we have been here before &#151; the tail must still be removed and a stronger batting performance than previously witnessed this winter is required. </p>\n<p>\nFailure to win here would see a series defeat and the loss of their World No1 Test status. </p>\n<p>\nWith Stuart Broad injured, England opted to drop Monty Panesar and bolster their seam attack with Finn and Tim Bresnan. </p>\n<p>\nBut it was the familiar figure of Anderson who drew first blood. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nTillakaratne Dilshan nicking to Matt Prior after a wild 14-run cameo and Sangakkara bagging a second golden duck of the series with Strauss juggling a catch at first slip. </p>\n<p>\nJayawardene saw off the hat-trick ball, but Anderson had not finished his morningâs work, seeing off Lahiru Thirimanne after he unwisely padded up to straight one. </p>\n<p>\nThat brought Thilan Samaraweera to the crease and he soon set about rebuilding with his captain. </p>\n<p>\nHe and Jayawardene took their side to 82-3 at lunch, combining for a stand of 124 in total. </p>\n<p>\nFinn thought he had Samaraweera caught at short-leg for 36 only for the umpires &#151; both on the field and on review &#151; to disagree. </p>\n<p>\nEngland were unimpressed by the verdict, with team director Andy Flower seen remonstrating with officials. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBresnan finally broke the stand after 43 wicketless overs, going full and straight just before tea to trap Samaraweera lbw for 54. </p>\n<p>\nJayawardene had a moment of fortune on 79, edging Anderson just wide of Straussâ left hand at slip and picking up four runs in the process. </p>\n<p>\nHe was held up by a drinks break one short of his landmark, before nudging Samit Patel into the on-side to bring up his century. </p>\n<p>\nAngelo Mathews had settled at the other end too, doing his part to rotate the strike in a stand of 62. </p>\n<p>\nEngland were struggling until Swann, bowling round the wicket, finally found a way past Jayawardeneâs bat and won an lbw verdict from Asad Rauf. </p>\n<p>\nStrauss celebrated by unwrapping the new ball and Finn obliged by snaring Englandâs sixth wicket, Prasanna Jayawardene caught behind for seven. </p>\n<p>\nMathews had eked an important 41 not out by the close, with Suraj Randiv with him overnight. </p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/mahela_1483455a.jpg","caption":"TON IT AGAIN ...

Weâll see who is right tomorrow night.â\n</p>\n<p>\nThatâs all the Pep talk Messi needed, really. </p>\n<p>\nLast time a stat like that cropped up was in 2009 before the Rome final between Barca and Manchester United. </p>\n<p>\nSomeone pointed out Messi had not scored in 10 matches against English opposition. </p>\n<p>\nWeeks earlier Messi had provided the killer ball at Stamford Bridge that allowed Andres Iniestaâs sensational tie-winning leveller and sank Guus Hiddinkâs Blues on away goals. </p>\n<p>\nYet back then Messiâs zero goals against English clubs had led some bandwagon jumpers to doubt him. </p>\n<p>\nSo at the Stadio Olimpico against United geed-up Messi rose majestically to head Barcaâs second â a masterful finish across the face of Edwin Van Der Sarâs goal. </p>\n<p>\nHe has won the title of the best player in the world every year since that night. </p>\n<p>\nArsenal in the knockout stages and United, in last yearâs final at Wembley, have felt the full force of Messiâs killer instinct since that night in Rome. </p>\n<p>\nBarca bid to reach a historic fifth semi on the bounce â and a third potentially against English opposition if Chelsea finish Benfica off tomorrow. </p>\n<p>\nGuardiola said: âThe success we have is to be in the quarter-finals for the fifth consecutive time fighting to be in the semi-final of the European Cup. </p>\n<p>\n\"It is one of the things that makes me the most proud.â\n</p>\n<p>\nMilanâs defensive machine has been boosted by the return of veteran star Alessandro Nesta since they dumped Arsenal out. </p>\n<p>\nLast week with Nesta they shut Messi and Barcelona out. </p>\n<p>\nTheir boss Massimo Allegri knows Milan will go through with a score draw or a win â but they were practising pens yesterday, just in case it finishes goalless after extra time. </p>\n<p>\nAllegri said: âBarcelona is the best team in the world and play the best football in the world. </p>\n<p>\n\"Milan has similar characteristics to Barcelona but certainly against them we have to play a different game. </p>\n<p>\nâWe need to be careful and courageous. We need to score to go through. </p>\n<p>\n\"We will look to be positive knowing that we have two out of three results in our favour. </p>\n<p>\nâItâs a historic game because it always is, because itâs between the two most important clubs.â\n</p>","attachments":{"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/LionelMessi_1483537a.jpg","caption":"ALL SMILES ...

âThe truth is we are very much affected by the very bad news about our captain. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâNo one expected it, it caught us by surprise and left us in shock. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâLast week we were still affected by the situation of Fabrice Muamba â it affected us mentally and psychologically. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâSo imagine if it is one of your intimate friends, a comrade with whom youâve shared a dressing room for four years. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâMy team-mates and I are deeply affected and very emotional but Stiliyan is the first to give us strength, trying to lift us so that we win as many games and points as we can. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâItâs the only thing he asked of us.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCuellar also revealed that Petrov still <b>SINGS</b> to him on the phone, a sign the brave Bulgarian is full of belief he will win his fight against illness. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nSpanish defender Cuellar, 30, said: âHe always sings a song to me âCarlos Cuellar you make me happyâ. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâYesterday he surprised me because, when I called, he responded and started singing that song. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâIt relaxes you and it shows he will win this fight because heâs a brave man with a lot of strength.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAlex McLeishâs Villa are having a tough time of it in the Premier League and lie just five points off the drop zone. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nYet Cuellar insists Petrov faces a much bigger fight â and has backed him to win it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHe added: âI speak to Stan every day and it is him that is giving us strength. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâHe knows itâs a tough situation but heâs certain he will win â and his family is giving him strength. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâHis first priority is to keep his wife and kids happy and recover as quickly as possible for them. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâHeâs a strong guy and he will definitely pull through. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâHeâs also a courageous man and knows he can give courage to many other people who are suffering the same fate. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâOften we seem like gods, untouchables but weâre normal â with the same weaknesses as everyone else.â\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nPetrov was fighting back tears as Villa Park rose to acclaim him during the clash with Chelsea. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nCuellar concluded: âHeâs getting countless messages of support from so many people. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nâHeâs always had a smile on his face and he wants to continue smiling.â\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4233498/Uwe-Rosler-who-won-his-own-fight-against-lung-cancer-is-offering-his-help-to-Stiliyan-Petrov.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Uwe

He turned to them and punched the air with both fists. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was as big a celebratory gesture as we have seen from the United boss all season. </p>\n<p>\nHe knew what last night meant and another managerial master class is almost complete. </p>\n<p>\nFrom five points behind on March 3 to five points ahead a month later. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the time City play Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon it could be eight points. </p>\n<p>\nEven Roberto Mancini conceded that would be that. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile City have stumbled, taking just five points from their last 12, United have stormed past them on a run of 10 wins and one draw. </p>\n<p>\nFor the third season running a trip to Ewood Park looks like proving decisive. </p>\n<p>\nTwo seasons ago a goalless draw here on the back of a home defeat to Chelsea would ultimately cost them the title. </p>\n<p>\nLast season Wayne Rooneyâs penalty sealed a point in the penultimate game as a record 19th league title was won. </p>\n<p>\nLast night it was moments of magic from Valencia and Young coupled with some brilliance from goalkeeper David De Gea and that unshakeable will and belief that saw United through. </p>\n<p>\nFirst, Valenciaâs goal. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was fed down the right by Rafael and then darted into the box on an angle. </p>\n<p>\nEveryone waited for the pass, instead came the shot with the outside of his boot across and beyond the grasping clutch of Paul Robinson. </p>\n<p>\nFergie jumped from the bench, arms waving in excitement. </p>\n<p>\nIt says everything about the man that these moments still bring as much joy today as they ever have. </p>\n<p>\nThe second goal followed five minutes later and came at the end of two minutes of United possession and 38 passes. </p>\n<p>\nIt ended with Valenica squaring the final ball for Young. </p>\n<p>\nIn a blur he turned and shot, the ball starting its journey outside the right-hand upright but curling into the bottom corner. </p>\n<p>\nThat was that. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYet it had been far from an easy night, despite United having the weight of the possession. </p>\n<p>\nFor De Gea it was the night his season turned full circle. On New Yearâs Eve his gaffe gifted Blackburn victory at Old Trafford and he was dropped. </p>\n<p>\nLast night he made three world-class saves from Junior Hoilett, Marcus Olsson and Grant Hanley. </p>\n<p>\nThe supporters were singing De Geaâs name and you not would have put money on that at the turn of the year. </p>\n<p>\nUnited had their chances in the first half too with Javier Hernandez miscuing an early chance and then clipping the ball off the post. </p>\n<p>\nThe second half brought opportunities at either end. </p>\n<p>\nMorten Gamst Pedersen thought he had taken the lead for the home side until his 63rd-minute âgoalâ was ruled out after the assistant referee said the ball had gone out before Steven Nzonzi pulled it back. </p>\n<p>\nThen in the 77th minute came a tackle that would prove as crucial as Valenciaâs goal at the other end. Hoilett broke to the byline and crossed, Yakubu was in at the near post and the Rovers fans behind the goal were already out of their seats. </p>\n<p>\nBut Rio Ferdinand got his foot in and executed a brilliant challenge. </p>\n<p>\nThen the big moment came from Valencia and just five minutes after that Young scored. </p>\n<p>\nNot only did the victory send United clear at the top but it dropped Rovers back into the bottom three on goal difference from QPR. </p>\n<p>\nAt the final whistle the United players and staff saluted the travelling fans, who had sang their hearts out all night. </p>\n<p>\nâWeâre gonna win the leagueâ was their final refrain. </p>\n<p>\nAnd few now would argue. </p>\n<p>\n<b>DREAM TEAM</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>STAR MAN â ANTONIO VALENCIA (MAN UNITED) </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>BLACKBURN: </b>Robinson 6, Lowe 6, Dann 7, Hanley 7, Mt Olsson 7, Orr 6, Pedersen 6, Nzonzi 7, Mc Olsson 7, Hoilett 7, Yakubu 6.

We just need some better luck.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRaikkonen said he feels like he has never been away from F1.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe added: \"Maybe people see me as more relaxed, which I think is down to the team.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"It's a different atmosphere to what I've experienced before. Everyone is very open and laid back but at the same time they work extremely hard and pay a lot of attention to detail.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I feel comfortable here, which helps me to focus on racing. I guess that's why people seem to think I'm a different person. But I'm just as focused and motivated as before.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLotusâs trackside chief Alan Permane backed Raikkonen â and believes the team will emerge as F1âs third best, ready to take the fight to McLaren and Red Bull.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe said: \"It would be nice to have a straightforward race with no penalties and no crashes from Romain after the first couple of corners.\n</p>\n<p>\nâI think it is McLaren and Red Bull Racing at the front, and then I believe we are there.\n</p>\n<p>\nâIt's going to be a good battle. To be in a development race with these proper big boys means it will take everything we've got to stay with them.\"\n</p>","attachments":{"article":[{"uri":"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/motorsport/4236301/Inside-F1-column-Caterham-team-reflect-on-the-gruelling-jet-lag-in-early-Formula-1-season.html?iPadApp=true","caption":"Jet lag is bad snooze for our truckies"}],"image":[{"uri":"http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01483/kimi_1483484a.jpg","caption":"FINN IT TO WIN IT ...
